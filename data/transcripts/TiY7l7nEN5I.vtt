00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
from all of you thank you for coming
 
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
and with that let us proceed to the to
 
00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 align:start position:0%
the business at hand and I would open um
 
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 align:start position:0%
I would I would start with a house bill
 
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
299 representative Weber do you have a
 
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.769 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
I beg your pardon I would move itl on on
 
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
199 299.
 
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
and I would like to speak to my motion
 
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
sure is there a second for that
 
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Parma seconds a
 
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
um we are all concerned about
 
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
everybody having access to care
 
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 align:start position:0%
and that's a fundamental principle I
 
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
think for everybody on this committee
 
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
my concern with the bill as it is
 
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.190 align:start position:0%
my concern with the bill as it is
written

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.810 align:start position:0%
is that
it

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.590 align:start position:0%
it
requires

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
Physicians to take into account things
 
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
that are not generally accepted good
 
00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
Medical Practice
 
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not we ration
 
00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
Medical Care all the time and we
 
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
hope that care is directed to the
 
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.770 align:start position:0%
hope that care is directed to the
neediest

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
neediest
 
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
rather than the loudest
 
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
and secondly my other concern with the
 
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
bill is the creation of a private right
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
of action which I think is very
 
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunate and not helpful so that's
 
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's my concern with the bill
 
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other discussion
 
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.569 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
chairman

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
um I think some of the reason why I
 
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
support this bill is actually rather
 
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
similar to similar to the concerns just
 
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
voiced I believe that we need to make
 
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
sure that when care is rationed it's
 
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
based on specific medical need as
 
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
opposed to any societal issues we need
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
to be looking at who needs that care
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
that can have something where it comes
 
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
down to socioeconomic because you need
 
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the care is
 
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 align:start position:0%
appropriate to where somebody is being
 
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 align:start position:0%
discharged and that's a medical need we
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
have some drugs that are only approved
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
for people of African descent and that's
 
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
a true medical need in order to have
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
that for those people I believe that
 
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
this language actually makes it more
 
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
clear that this needs to focus on just
 
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
medical need but I recognize that
 
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
there's a difference of opinion here so
 
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
this is one that I'll be writing a
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
report either it's majority or minority
 
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
whichever way it is in order to make
 
00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 align:start position:0%
these statements thank you
 
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
other comments other discussion
 
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro
 
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I think often we
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
are debating bills um and ignoring the
 
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
subtext behind the bill like
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
a recent example is we had a whole
 
00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 align:start position:0%
debate about
 
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
um reporting abortion statistics and for
 
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
the most part people don't talk about
 
00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
their feelings about abortion being
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
legal or illegal
 
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.729 align:start position:0%
legal or illegal
um

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
in this case the sponsor who brought
 
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
this bill was very clear about what the
 
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 align:start position:0%
intentions were of the bill and he
 
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
started off his
 
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
um he started off his presentation
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
saying that the terms Health Equity and
 
00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
anti-racism were just the other words
 
00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.490 align:start position:0%
anti-racism were just the other words
for

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
um discrimination against white people
 
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
um discrimination against white people
essentially

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you
 
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know of course it's a very complex
 
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
thing to decide who gets what care
 
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.770 align:start position:0%
thing to decide who gets what care
but

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
because I think those intentions are
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
very dangerous
 
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I think there are inequities in
 
00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
health care that need to be addressed I
 
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
will certainly vote against this bill
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I would urge other people to do that
 
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.610 align:start position:0%
and I would urge other people to do that
too

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
other discussion yes representative
 
00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.770 align:start position:0%
other discussion yes representative
Palmer

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
Palmer
 
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
so um just speaking as a practicing
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
physician who and I think the example
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
that was brought up during the testimony
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
had to do with a treatment during covid
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I would be very nervous about having
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
any kind of thing about action simply
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
because that was shifting ground it
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
changed from week to week what was the
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
accepted who who should Pro be
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
prioritized to get which treatment and
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you're then trying to you know look
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
back and you know did the doctor do the
 
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
right thing at the right time almost
 
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
impossible so I really would oppose this
 
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
bill based on that part of it
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
 
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be supporting itl but
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
maybe not for the same reasons everybody
 
00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
else is I believe in Freedom of
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
Association and I don't believe in
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws I think we
 
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
should get rid of all of them and I
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
think we should let people
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
um associate freely and there might be
 
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
cases where
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
certain doctors want to only
 
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.310 align:start position:0%
certain doctors want to only
um

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
treat people that they like or that are
 
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
like them and I don't see any problem
 
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
with that actually I think that might
 
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
increase the quality in health care
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
right now there's a lot of people that
 
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
they go to the doctor and maybe they
 
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
don't think they're treated very well
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
and they
 
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
um on the inside think oh maybe it's
 
00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 align:start position:0%
because I'm a woman or I'm black or
 
00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 align:start position:0%
something like that and if you could go
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
to a doctor that only treated black
 
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
women then you might feel better in that
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
care and you might get better care so I
 
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
know I'm living in Fantasyland again but
 
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
once again I'm against this bill but not
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons as everybody else
 
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay so you know the discussion I'll ask

House Bill 557 representative profile
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:27.620 align:start position:0%
representative McLean seconds
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I have a motion uh
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
an amendment that is being drafted for
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
this one I know that the hospital
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
Association asked the and in the third
 
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
line to be changed to or
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
and I I put that in to have drafted up
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
and do you know when the amendment may
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
be available no I don't
 
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.370 align:start position:0%
be available no I don't
um

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
this is the rules
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay sorry you're right
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
so we're good okay I was um so on House
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
Bill 557 representative colqualt do you
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes I I continue to hold that this is
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
a uh an important build by virtue of the
 
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
decisions of this gravity should be made
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
by the legislature uh decisions
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
compelling people to uh to take certain
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
medications or or treatments or to give
 
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
those to their children is a very very
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
serious decision and should not be
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
delegated beyond the legislature so I I
 
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
believe that this is
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is an important step in the right
 
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.750 align:start position:0%
this is an important step in the right
direction

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you another discussion
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
I I think we're just going to disagree
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
about this I under I I understand
 
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.329 align:start position:0%
about this I under I I understand
um

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative kovoltz
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
um here we go
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know desire to have legislators
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
decide this I mean I think be also
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
because it's such a grave decision I
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
would see it as being beneficial to be
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
kept in the hands of professionals
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
um with adequate oversight from the
 
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
legislature but especially given the
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
level of partisanship and contention in
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
politics these days I think I mean a
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
scientific decision initially
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
um to be researched and made by the
 
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:30.740 align:start position:0%
legislature is not the best way to go
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
I think we should have oversight and
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
make be able to make the final decision
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
but I think we should give these
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
decisions initially to people who are
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
steeped in medicine and Science and this
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
is their area of expertise this is why
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
we hire them
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Murphy thank you
 
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:53.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
as representative Shapiro said I suspect
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
you understand where I would come down
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
on which side I would oppose an OTP on
 
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.870 align:start position:0%
on which side I would oppose an OTP on
this

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
um in for part of the reasons that
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro talked about but
 
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
this is really a medical decision that
 
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
really should be left in the hands of
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
those that make Public Health policy and
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
the they have actually stated in
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that they have no intention of
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccines you know you know
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
going forward necessarily changing their
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements they haven't had a
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know an additional vaccine since
 
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
2003 that was mandated
 
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.630 align:start position:0%
2003 that was mandated
um

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
I just feel that this was a reaction to
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
covet obviously but on the other hand in
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
order to really make a decision that is
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
sound for patients it really ought to be
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
done by those that have expertise in
 
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
medicine but also in public health so I
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
would vote against and urge others to
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
vote against an OTP motion
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh representative McLean
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:01.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'd actually put together an amendment
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
for this but you know upon reflection I
 
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
think the bill is pretty good as it is I
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
think bottom line is the rulemaking
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
authority is relatively recent so this
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't put us back into territory that
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
we haven't been in before and it's not
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
like we're bringing in new vaccines
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
every three or four months in fact I
 
00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019 align:start position:0%
think it's been 20 years you know and
 
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
the the biggest lesson that I learned
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
from the covid pandemic is not the
 
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
mistakes were made yes of course
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
mistakes are made and I can forgive
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
people we're all human beings but the
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
biggest disappointment was just how much
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
I thought Supreme that speech was
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
suppressed and and that really bothered
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
me a lot but the one place that had an
 
00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
antidote to that actually was the New
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives which
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
is incredibly open and Incredibly
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
transparent and so while my wife might
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
be mocked on Facebook or something one
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
place anybody could come was the New
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
whether you were smart whether you were
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
dumb whether you were knowledgeable or
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
whether you were a kook everybody could
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
come and things just kept going on now I
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
looked at a rules making hearing back in
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
2021 which had to do with the vaccine
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
registry and what they were looking to
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
do is they were looking to eliminate the
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
opt-out and in fact role people who had
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
opted out actually into the registry of
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
course a lot of people showed up they
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
were very upset and so what happened and
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
that rule-making hearing is everybody
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
says oh my gosh we have all these people
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
here they're upset and there's way more
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
than we thought we're going to have to
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
you know shelve the hearing you know now
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
contrast that to the hearing that we had
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
last week on gender affirming care I
 
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.290 align:start position:0%
last week on gender affirming care I
mean

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
lots of passions lots of people and the
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
the chairman had a stack of pink cards
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
that thick and we went through every
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
single one of them there was no talk
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
about hey we're going to have to back
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
off on this hearing and I remember being
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
in judiciary when Marjorie Smith was the
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
the chairwoman and that would be an
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
abortion bill that suddenly was bigger
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
than we thought
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recess the hearing for 20
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
minutes we're going to move it over to
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
the state house and we're going to go on
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
and so that is what we have here in New
 
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with this legislature and I
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
just think you know I'm not an
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxxer personally but I know that
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of anti-vaxxers and my
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
solution to that is not to be less
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
transparent my solution to that is
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
actually to be more transparent and I
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
think that this is an excellent Bill and
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
I'm going to support it
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald's I support
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:47.779 align:start position:0%
not just Statewide but federally
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
legislatures have abrogated their power
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
to the executive branch and this is one
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
tiny little step that we take that power
 
00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:55.750 align:start position:0%
tiny little step that we take that power
back

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
departments and bureaucracies are there
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
to enforce the rules not make them and
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's our job thank you thank you of
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
the discussion representative Weber
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
I just want to note that during the
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
initial stages of covet the legislature
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
did not meet at all
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
um which would be a roadblock to the
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
legislature taking charge and when we
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
started to meet again it was with very
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
little process and
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
nowhere near as much thought as we
 
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
normally give to our bills far less
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
rigorous examination and that goes back
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
to the reason why I am
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cofult
 
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns that we heard was
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
um to to act quickly in the in the face
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
of a Public Health crisis and I think in
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
fact that the our experience with covid
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
um validates the concerns that arise uh
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
that prompted this bill and in fact the
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've recognized in
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
previous discussions around this bill
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
that the um the emergency power statute
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
grants the governor and the executive
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
branch a considerable latitude in the
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
case of a public health emergency
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
that this is something that uh that the
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
executive branch could have acted on had
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
they wished to impose such a mandate
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
um I think the experience with the uh
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 vaccine actually has uh
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
has has provided us with a case study
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
and why rushing something to uh to
 
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.749 align:start position:0%
and why rushing something to uh to
Market

00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
Market
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
um although it uh you know there there
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
may be reasons for doing that rushing it
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
to Market and particularly mandating it
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh when it is rushed to Market is uh is
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea and I think the
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
reason many people have so many very
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
serious reservations about the uh the
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine and its side effects
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
um just speaks to the need for
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
um for for a bill like this with respect
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
to vaccines in general that people
 
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.140 align:start position:0%
should have an opportunity to weigh in
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
in a fully transparent legislative
 
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:21.380 align:start position:0%
process through public hearings and that
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
the need to push something forward very
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
very quickly is not only
 
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.590 align:start position:0%
very quickly is not only
um

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
a a a a poor reason to to you know to
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
delegate this responsibility
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
um it's it's probably pretty bad public
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
policy to uh to rush things forward that
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
quickly in the first place
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Reed thank you Mr
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that how covid was
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
handled and the um covert vaccine
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
mandates and the rushing through has
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
shaken the faith and trust in the
 
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.870 align:start position:0%
shaken the faith and trust in the
community

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
around vaccines and health care in
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
general I think this bill would be a
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction in restoring
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
that trust and with transparency and
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
assuring that people have a say in what
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
they put in their bodies and their
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
families bodies thank you very much
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
um uh I I suppose this bill and I
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
suppose discussed yes we have some
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
partisanship in the body but also we can
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
federal agencies are also make the
 
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
on the on medical reasoning and
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
so I would like to see like
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
some responsibilities
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
because if some decisions were outlier
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
to learn I would like like to see that
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
uh uh collection measures were made but
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
what we often see is people
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
fail to success somebody is on on HIV
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
and then he is promoted and then the
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
same person is around on lockdowns and
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
on masks and on other issues and the
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
person is still being promoted so
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
and when I see it I don't trust
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
those agencies to make Right medical
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
based decisions for us thank you thank
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
you another discussion yes
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
I just have a question for um
 
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative co-fold and I I'm I may
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
be mixing this up with something else
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
but I I I was
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
I kind of remember that an amendment was
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
either brought or talked about that
 
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
make the three
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are already were already
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
brought through rulemaking and make them
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
permanent in statute
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
um now I don't know if someone just
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
talked to me about amendments or I
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
actually saw something like that but
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just clarify that you
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
know so there there was a proposed
 
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
amendment which has not been brought
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
forward to do that that is also what
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
happened last year when I brought this
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill forward for the first time
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and that Amendment
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
passed a lot it actually only added I
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
believe it only added varicella last
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
year that Amendment passed 11 to
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
11 to 10 in um
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
in this committee last year so
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
um yes that has been discussed my
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
objection to that my concern with that
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
um it it still does not afford the
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislature an opportunity to conduct a
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
full and transparent public hearing
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
process and and
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
to be accountable for the decision of
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
Cushman I'll be brief because I know
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
that we want to get to voting here
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that I support
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill as written very much so and
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
especially not
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
um putting some of those veteran rules
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
in statute also for example hepatitis B
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine I think if that had been left up
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislature it wouldn't have been
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
added to the requirements for schools
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's a disease that is primarily a risk
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
for IV drug users and requiring it for
 
00:21:56.409 --> 00:21:56.419 align:start position:0%
three-year-old children
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know to go to school I think that
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
that was a decision that the legislature
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
would not have supported and hepatitis B
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
positive children are in maybe in school
 
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
too and we you know you don't know
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
so there's just there's just some
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
argument there again about handing this
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
authority over to
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
um you know administrative rulemaking in
 
00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
the department so I think it should
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
definitely stay in the legis be back in
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the hands of the legislature thank you
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you another discussion
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
Murphy just be clear relative to
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's comment so the
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was initially talked
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
about eliminating these vaccines from
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
statute is not going forward this is
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
gonna as written as as written currently
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
in what we have right now is that
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
correct my understanding representative
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
profile so to clarify their
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
some vaccine mandates currently are in
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
statute some vaccines currently are in
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
rules the proposed amendment and the one
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
that came forward last year moved
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
well the the bill as drafted
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
would would simply say whatever in
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
statute stays in statute whichever in
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
rules stays there until those rules
 
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.630 align:start position:0%
rules stays there until those rules
expire

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
expire
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
but rulemaking power is not granted
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
going forward so they could not be
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
renewed the amendment would have moved
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
one or more it depends on which
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
amendment we're talking about but would
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
would have moved one or more from Rules
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
into statute
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that as we revoke rule making
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
Authority for anything going forward we
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
would also be
 
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
would also be
um

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.570 align:start position:0%
um
essentially

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:37.580 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
making those putting putting the the
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
ones that are currently in rules in
 
00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:43.610 align:start position:0%
ones that are currently in rules in
statute

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
just to follow up sure follow up so to
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
the rule as it stands or the statue that
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
stands varicella the highly contagious
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hepatitis B in h flu will sundown
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
in 2026 unless it's otherwise reinstated
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct yeah
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
and again with respect to Hepatitis B I
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
think the the large concerns
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
are you know given that it is generally
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
speaking an adult lifestyle disease
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
um there are those who might choose not
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
to have it for their children
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I think the the main concern with
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
hepatitis B is the extremely serious
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
consequences that arise if an infant
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
somehow manages to contract hepatitis B
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's a you know it's a
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
potentially fatal incident so those are
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
the but but in in answer to your
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
question yes those with sunset unless
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
the legislature makes an affirmative
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
did you have a question you would raise
 
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
your hand I thought oh I'm sorry it's
 
00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:04.850 align:start position:0%
your hand I thought oh I'm sorry it's
just

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Leon uh
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I said on the administrative joint on
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
gel car and this addresses one of the
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the current rule making
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
process right now a rule would be only
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
be denied because it is contrary to the
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
statutes so when when these vaccines
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
have been added through administrative
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
rules there's the only way that's the
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
input of the public is recognized as if
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
the department chooses to make a
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
recognition of that input and change
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
their guidelines these are things that
 
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
should be discussed and they should be
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
brought to the legislature because they
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
have large impacts I would expect that
 
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes that next spring
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
that for next next year but while we're
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
still in this committee we'll see a bill
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
to bring those vaccines and add them
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
into the statutes that should be a
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
separate discussion I can probably
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
predict what will happen with that and
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
they likely would end up being adopted
 
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
but there should be an opportunity for
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
this discussion this this is an area
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
where we're not talking about access
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about requirements and the
 
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
public should have the opportunity to be
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
heard which is one of the things that
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does best
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
the roll motion is ought to pass on
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%

having been told last week that we have
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
to then make the other motion before we
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
send it without recommendation I move

representative Weber
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask representative Murphy
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
if he might write the minor the the
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
statement in favor of of Ideal gladly I
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
was just waiting for representative
 
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
Shapiro to you know nominate me well I I
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
thought we'd kind of dumped on him last
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
um next one we will consider is cacr8
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
um pushman did you want to I mean I'm
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I moved to itl on
 
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I moved to itl on
cacr8

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
cacr8
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative Kushner
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
oh second uh representative Missouri did
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
you want to speak or did you say sure no
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
I will sure go ahead yeah
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I think the consensus is right now
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
that they're no one is being denied
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
birth control
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
um a problem really doesn't exist there
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
was no one here except the bill
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
sponsored to testify to that and this
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
would involve a Constitutional Amendment
 
00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:10.549 align:start position:0%
would involve a Constitutional Amendment
which

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is not needed so
 
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
I would just state that if we are going
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
to amend the Constitution I would favor
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
an amendment that deals broadly with all
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights and decision making
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
but I I think that piecemeal for one
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
particular smaller segment is not wise
 
00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
the Constitution for me is a a structure
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
and a framework not the details thank
 
00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
ready I am motion is a itl on cacr8
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%

representative priest yes
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yes
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer yes
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Howard and representative
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
McDonald yes 20-0
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
there was no objection and we will put
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.210 align:start position:0%
moving on
um

00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
proceed now to House Bill 277
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman do you have a
 
00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:09.470 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman do you have a
motion

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes I move that HB 277 be inexpedient
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative lay on seconds discussion
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to emotions sure
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
um I think this bill is just too messy
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
it puts
 
00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:30.169 align:start position:0%
it puts
um

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
it puts some mandates on providers to
 
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
refer to a very very small pool of
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
providers that possibly exist in the
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
state that are willing to do these
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
procedures where others aren't
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
um I think that there's just a lot of
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
um issues with it it's
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's just not straightforward I do like
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of it in general
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know women should be
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
able to make medical decisions for their
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
bodies and it's a shame that
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
um some doctors think that they know
 
00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
better about women's lifestyle choices
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is written I just can't support
 
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.230 align:start position:0%
the bill is written I just can't support
so

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
all right yes representative Weber
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
um I second everything that
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman said I also note
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
that those of us who were here last term
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
and remember all of the discussions
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
about the patient's Bill of Rights and
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
how they get amended and how they get
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
posted now they get shared with patients
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
that too is a framework for how patients
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
are going to be treated by their medical
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
providers and the interactions between
 
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
providers and their patients and it is
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
not the place for uh detailing specific
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
procedures if this was something we
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to do specifically it needs to go
 
00:33:58.009 --> 00:33:58.019 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the statute as far as
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned particularly with all of
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
the qualifications that were in it so
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
for that for that reason and I I also
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
second the fact that I definitely
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
believe that people have the right to
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
make their own medical choices but the
 
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:14.780 align:start position:0%
providers also have the right
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
to decline to do something that they
 
00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:20.060 align:start position:0%
feel is
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
inadvisable for whatever reason but they
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to send them on to
 
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
somebody who can take care of the issue
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman we worked with the sponsor
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
of this bill to try and be I I'm I'm
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely sympathetic to the fact that
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
women are denied sterilization when they
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
want it and where they may be looking to
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
interrupt generational abuse
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I know people that were unable to
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
interrupt that but when we got into the
 
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
wards and trying to make this actually
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
work as intended without creating new
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
problems we just weren't able to get
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
there so I agree with what the other
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives have said so far and I'm
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl as well even though I
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
support the underlying effort this is
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
just not the right way to do it
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you other discussion
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
so you know all the discussion
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I just would ask that whoever writes
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
the report put that last sentiment in
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
the report I think it probably was going
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
in there anyway but I just wanted to
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
make it clear and I thank all of you
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%

um okay next up uh House Bill 378
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%

um thank you Mr chairman I move
Amendment

00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
2023-0492h on House Bill 378.
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
so representative McLean seconds
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
um this was handed out at the time of
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
the hearing all this does is it changes
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
the title and I can read that title um I
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
can send this up to HCS for a print
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
um but I will read because
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so the reason for the amendment is
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
because it was a previous the title
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
referred to a previous draft within the
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
whole drafting process and the title had
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
not been changed and that lead up to the
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill being introduced the amended title
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
with this amendment says an act
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%

representative

00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:55.010 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
hi now you can see me I can see you um
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
so um not everyone was here to hear this
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill so if we're voting in favor of this
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
we're voting in favor of
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
medical people
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
telling a patient who has been assaulted
 
00:39:16.849 --> 00:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
in some form or another that they are
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
entitled to have
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
samples collected
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
is that what we're voting for
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
um yes if I can answer that that is what
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
that is what we are voting for this
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
isn't creating a new right to these kits
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
because if you believe that you have
 
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
been assaulted or drugged in a sexual
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
assault and that sexual assault includes
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
um attempted rape it means groping of um
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
of sensitive areas of the body
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
um it's a very broad definition of
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
sexual assault as it should be because
 
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:52.430 align:start position:0%
sexual assault as it should be because
yes

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
um and as I remember the the sponsor who
 
00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:57.890 align:start position:0%
um and as I remember the the sponsor who
had

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
not been penetrated and so when the talk
 
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
of a kid coming up the hospital
 
00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:06.770 align:start position:0%
of a kid coming up the hospital
personnel

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
assumed there would be no semen sample
 
00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
to collect so they denied her a kit
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
the hospital seemed to have a very
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
narrow view of of what an assault was so
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
this would broaden that because the
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
sponsor that brought it up was concerned
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
that she had been drugged and only the
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
kits that they have at the hospital test
 
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to be clear that we
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
got all the facts straight so okay thank
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
you and then if I make sure go ahead
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
um so yes this this provides that the
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
Physicians would need to inform somebody
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
um a man or a woman who was sexually
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
assaulted or which includes the attempt
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
at rape um that they have the ability to
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
collect this evidence
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
um with that does not mean that they
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
need to stock them and have them on hand
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
it just makes needs that means that they
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
need to inform them of that right and by
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
being required to inform them of that
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
right they need to know they will then
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
know that people have the right to
 
00:41:10.569 --> 00:41:10.579 align:start position:0%
collect this evidence
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
there have been some concern about
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
whether a test finding no drugs in the
 
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
system would be conclusive that you were
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
not drugged that's actually not the way
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
that tests work that it would just
 
00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
simply say that they did not find any
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
drugs it doesn't mean that you were not
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
drugged and this is an area to
 
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
drugged and this is an area to
um

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
I went to college I knew plenty of women
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
that and my sorority and others that
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
were in these situations but they did
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
not think that they would be listened to
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
so they never reported anything
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
and Reporting an attempt is actually
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
very important because many of the
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults there's many that have a
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
history and a history of escalation and
 
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
so by collecting this information it can
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
start moving towards finding these
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
people earlier in the progression before
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
Things become worse so
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
um this this is
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
I I support this
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
feeling that nobody's going to listen to
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
you and they're not going to take
 
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.109 align:start position:0%
you and they're not going to take
evidence

00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
is something that you end up living with
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
the rest of your life and that giving
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
this opportunity and simply saying you
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
know if you feel that happen if you feel
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
that that happened we can get that
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
evidence to collect for you I think is a
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
major step towards healing because we
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
speak about all the increase in
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
mental health issues suicidality and
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
addressing these at the time of a
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
life-changing event is one way to break
 
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:43.460 align:start position:0%
that cycle
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I was not present for this hearing so
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
I feel a little bit of it at a
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
disadvantage so I hope you'll indulge me
 
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.550 align:start position:0%
disadvantage so I hope you'll indulge me
and

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
um were there people who came to oppose
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know to give testimony in opposition
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and if so what was their what was the
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo a U.S that in
 
00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:15.859 align:start position:0%
response to his question or well uh um
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
when police testified they said that
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
some police departments for example in
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
smaller towns they have only a small Dom
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
size fridges to collect samples from
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
those kids before they are being
 
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:35.780 align:start position:0%
transferred to permanent storage place
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
so my uh I I would say I'm ready to
 
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
donate to my towns if they need a larger
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
fridge and i would support our efforts
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
if we need to
 
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
collect samples of actual assaults I
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
think it's one of primary roles of us as
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
a government thinker representative
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
McLean and then representative farmer
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
you know uh thank you Mr chair and and
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
maybe the the vice chair could clarify
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
this because I just my understanding
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
from the testimony was that there was
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
something that this added and that is
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
that you know this line here for the
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of this paragraph assault
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
includes any unwanted sexual touching
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
and I thought that was an addition and
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
for that reason the New Hampshire
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
Coalition against sexual violence and
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
the police were opposed to it because
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're saying now what could actually
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
happen is could actually impede the
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a conviction because
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
you haven't had penetration you're just
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know grabbing someone
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
by the buttocks for example and so as a
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
result of that there's nothing that's
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
going to show up in the kit and in the
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
past you know they would say no we're
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
not going to offer you for this reason
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
because it might be it might counter the
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a conviction so that
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
I think that element if that's an
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
addition that does concern me
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I do agree that
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know when we spoke with the the
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
the chief of the Newport Police
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
Department he says they review every
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
case and in those situations where a kit
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
is not given and it should have been we
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
do go back and we do update our
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
standards I do think that we should be
 
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
looking at a way to give a woman an
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get a second opinion so
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
you don't have to wait for a review
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
console to come back and make that
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
decision but I don't think this language
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
as it's written
 
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I would be inclined to go along with
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition against
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
sexual violence and police where I'd be
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
representative Palmers so getting back a
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
little bit to representative Shapiro's
 
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.750 align:start position:0%
little bit to representative Shapiro's
question

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting with the New Hampshire
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
Medical Society and there were a number
 
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
of people there who gave opinions on
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
this which and and the part that I'm
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
that concerned them with a little bit
 
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:05.940 align:start position:0%
the same as representative McLean so I
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
won't go over that part
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
sexual assault nurse testified against
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
it sort of based on
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
some of these concerns about
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
practicalities not not that the idea
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
wasn't good but just
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying our system works pretty well and
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
this might might make us stumble over it
 
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
the ER Physicians and nurses were very
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
concerned about the particularly about
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
the drugged one partly because of the
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
what the drug tests do and don't do and
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
partly because of issues with chain of
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
um chain of custody of the evidence and
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
their their ears are already overflowing
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
and if they have a room and a nurse who
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
has to stay with the patient until the
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
police get there they're really worried
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
that this would um just be an another
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
impossible thing to to manage on top of
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
what they're already doing
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and I think the the ER physician
 
00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.349 align:start position:0%
um and I think the the ER physician
um

00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
said you know we we offer this but don't
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
make don't don't put it in you know
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
don't make me document it and then ding
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
me or have some penalty if I didn't
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
document that I did it or so there were
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
mostly sort of practical objections to
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
um not not spiritual
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
um and so I think that
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
thought was maybe this could be done in
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
a different way to to broaden maybe the
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
approach but not but not clog up the ER
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cushman
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so just to speak to a couple of
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
points that were just mentioned
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
um as far as I I think that this is just
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
since it's just informing them it's
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
really not changing what it's it's in
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
the situation that occurred where the
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
woman was not offered this and actually
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
was denied it when she asserted her
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
right to have it it was
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
drug metabolites that were being looked
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
for not semen samples because there was
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault that didn't involve
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
penetration and you know the the doctor
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
um had their own definition of sexual
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
assault and it was more narrow than what
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
sexual assault truly is defined as so I
 
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
think this will just correct them and
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
and give them a clear idea of you know
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
any any situation like that they should
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
inform the patient that it's that it's
 
00:48:35.819 --> 00:48:37.309 align:start position:0%
inform the patient that it's that it's
available

00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
um so in instead of suppressing that
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
information make it very easy for the
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
person to make a decision if they want
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
to do that or not thank you thank you
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri yeah thank you
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
um so representative Shapiro I also took
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
notes um from the Newport PD I there
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
were three things that he mentioned one
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
was what's been alluded to is toxicology
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that if a test is taken and it's
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
negative it could be harmful to
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution that was one of the things
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
he mentioned and then storage is they
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
said they had no space for an influx of
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
additional samples he did mention that
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
as well and then testing is uh many
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals don't already have the ability
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
to test for substances and it costs them
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars per test to send
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
out so those were that's something that
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
a PD said but with that said
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm still I'm still going to support
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
it so but there were that was something
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned that I thought was
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
helpful actually to hear
 
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.730 align:start position:0%
helpful actually to hear
so

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
another discussion representative King
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
um this was originally a bill that um
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
well let's just say I I had a lot of
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
mixed feelings on this bill I see both
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
sides of the argument
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh very clearly and I was vacillating on
 
00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
which way to support it and so my
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
question is for representative Weber you
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
had mentioned you will not be supporting
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
this bill and I would very much like to
 
00:50:04.809 --> 00:50:04.819 align:start position:0%
hear why thank you
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
I think my my concerns have already been
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
expressed my understanding from
 
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
discussions with people who were here
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
because I was not was that there were
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
concerns both on the part of emergency
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
room personnel
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
about their ability to
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
deal with this
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
as it's written and also concerns on the
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
part of the Coalition against Domestic
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence who are the people
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
who support
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
people who have undergone assaults and
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
for that reason I would I would tend to
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
defer to them on this issue
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah when I was listening to the
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
testimony before and I think one of the
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
biggest concerns that people had and
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
this is in reference to representative
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
Shapiro's question previously was the
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
line in the uh in act uh to offer intake
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
and preserve so that was going to put a
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
significant burden on this amendment is
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
basically eliminating that action there
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
the amendment which
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
I appreciate trying to get to some
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
middle ground or compromised position uh
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
it just basically says you have to
 
00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:24.500 align:start position:0%
inform the patient the the the
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from police was as mentioned
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
by representative Missouri there were
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
three components of that as well that
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
they already had protocols in place and
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
to take store and do it properly was
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
going to put an undue burden however
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
having said all that it would sound as
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
though I would lean towards supporting
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
as amended but I would not in this
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
principally my my position is that
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
this is I don't believe in legislating
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
medical care now anecdotally you know
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
people have bad experiences with many
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
Industries including medicine I
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but I don't think that
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
mandating medical care which I believe
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
is done properly the majority of the
 
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:06.980 align:start position:0%
time anecdotes aside
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
there's a place to educate to adjudicate
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
any of these potential problems that
 
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.329 align:start position:0%
any of these potential problems that
providers

00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
um don't do that would be the Board of
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
Medicine I don't think it belongs in
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
statute to require them to do something
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
that they do the majority of the time so
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the anecdote I appreciate
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
the concern I appreciate the intent but
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
I cannot support it even as amended but
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
I also appreciate the attempt to try to
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
get to something that is a bit more
 
00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.290 align:start position:0%
get to something that is a bit more
palatable

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
palatable
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
no representative Weber
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
I was just going to raise the question
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
about whether people thought if we
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
retained this bill we might be able to
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
come up with language that was more
 
00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.089 align:start position:0%
come up with language that was more
appropriate

00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:52:59.329 --> 00:52:59.339 align:start position:0%
and I I just put that forward as a
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion it is certainly for the
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
moving parties to decide whether they
 
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
want to do that or not
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
for that situa that suggestion um I
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
think that's probably would be a good
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
way to move I do want to make the point
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
that the Coalition against domestic
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
violence felt stated that unless there
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
was penetration there was no need to
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
collect a sample kit which I find very
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
concerning this is a very good reason to
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
retain this and work on this because
 
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
there may actually be larger issues that
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're unaware of and we may need to look
 
00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
at at the whole system of funding and
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
making sure that we are collecting the
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
appropriate forensic evidence so that we
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
can stop things early so with that I'd
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
be willing to withdraw my motion in
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
order to substitute another
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
and I can withdraw my second okay uh
 
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative land uh thank you um I
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
move that we retain house bill 378.
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
and I will second
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay is there any other discussion on on
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
that motion
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on this bill the
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative I think that's an
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
excellent idea
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you of the discussion
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'd ask that the clear
 
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:14.940 align:start position:0%

00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
2023-0934h copy of the amendment is

being circulated to house bill 323.
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:02.150 align:start position:0%
being circulated to house bill 323.
um

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
I had attempted to introduce an
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
amendment last week when we met that
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment had removed that whole
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
introductory section that spoke to the
 
00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
roots and origin of this bill this
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
amendment now instead of removing that
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
just adds this and replaces section two
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
which is the one that spoke to the
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism so we're retaining the
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
honoring honor of our late colleague
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
Catherine Rogers and the entire Genesis
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill within the legislative
 
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
findings in section one that was very
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
important and I apologize for that
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
Omission I was a bit in the let's drive
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
forward and get this done while
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
forgetting the necessary consequences of
 
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.430 align:start position:0%
forgetting the necessary consequences of
that

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
um sorry actually I can speak to my
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
motion I don't know if there was a
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
second deserve a second
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'll second that second representative
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
seconds okay thank you and I'll continue
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
speaking to the amendment
 
00:56:55.849 --> 00:56:55.859 align:start position:0%
um it also takes the advice to have it
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
so that the members are appointed by
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
different parties
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
um the language starting at line 10
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
through 14 says two members of the House
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
of Representatives and two alternates
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
with one member and one alternate
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Speaker of the House of
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives and one member and one
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
alternate appointed by the minority
 
00:57:12.059 --> 00:57:13.010 align:start position:0%
alternate appointed by the minority
leader

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
leader
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
if the Speaker of the House of
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
Representatives is a member of the
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
minority party the second member an
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
alternate should be appointed by the
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
majority leader since we've had that
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
situation in uh not so not that distant
 
00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:24.230 align:start position:0%
situation in uh not so not that distant
history

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
or because I was outside of it I may
 
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
have had that wrong but I think that
 
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's good practice then uh finally on
 
00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
line 30 it adds the role of biomarkers
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
in the duties of the committee so
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
basically this the original Bill had
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the idea of digging really
 
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
really deep into the science and getting
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
a really good functional knowledge of
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
specifically what's emerging what's
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
coming out and
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
quite frankly anybody who had the time
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
and bandwidth to do that job shouldn't
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
be making 200 every two years they
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
should be making north of 200 000 a year
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
working either for industry or for the
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
investment industry
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and so that was it was well-meaning
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
but far more allocation of resources
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
than any of us have here this committee
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
makes it a little bit more Nimble and
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
able to respond in speaking with the
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
um

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
the idea I raised the idea of requiring
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
this committee to meet more frequently
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
um but that but the point was brought
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
out that that could just make busy work
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
that this committee did not see any
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
necessary reason to meet this is
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
enabling but not mandating what this
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
committee needs to do it leaves them
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
ready to respond should they be needed
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
but does not charge them with with any
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
of these I do expect that anybody who
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
wants to be appointed to this committee
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
however will be digging into these
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies and we'll
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
be excited to do so so I don't think
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
that we need to require them to meet
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
more frequently
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
so that's my summary discussion on the
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Murphy thank
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
you I just had a question I when we
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
reviewed this last I remember we had a
 
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
change for the amendment and Katherine
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
Rogers and biomarkers Etc I had written
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
down here on line 23 the committee
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
instead of Xiao May
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
um is was that not the intent I
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh line 26 now
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
says the committee shall and I thought
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
to be nimble we were going to say may is
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
that not correct or am I mistaken what I
 
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.930 align:start position:0%
that not correct or am I mistaken what I
heard

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you I didn't write I didn't um
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
catch that when I was sending in that
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
draft Amendment
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
um if that's critical enough for us to
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
send this for another redraft we can do
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
that or else we can have that request
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
made to the Senate if this passes on and
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
that should be an easy concurrence if
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's the case I'd be happy with that I
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
was just trying to clarify what we
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
talked about that's all okay thank you
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Shapiro
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking this question to ensure
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
that I don't get appointed but could you
 
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
give an example of a biomarker clearly I
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
won't be asked to be on this committee
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you there
 
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
some of the biomarkers are ones that
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
show up on staining you would have a
 
01:00:22.809 --> 01:00:22.819 align:start position:0%
her2 positive breast cancer
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of different
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
genetic indicators that are biomarkers
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
that allow you to shape and shift what
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
the directed therapy would be one of the
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
big benefits with this is that sometimes
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
you find out that a drug only works in a
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
subset of patients so you're able to
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
tune it for best efficacy in those
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
patients and bring it to Market so they
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
can have it without denying care because
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
only one in five people benefits but
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
that one in five benefits dramatically
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
so a particular gene mutation would be
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
the Weber
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of the commercials that I
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
hear all the time about this treatment
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
is for these are television ads that are
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
broadcast all over the place this is for
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
people with hard hard to negative
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
something or other positive
 
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
breast cancer and I think oh my gosh you
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
know that's getting a little specific
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
but it they are specific but I would
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
also say that I I thank representative
 
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
Leon for incorporating all that stuff
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
into the amendment and I too am willing
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
to overlook the xiaomi thing I think we
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
can take care of that subsequently and
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
without a floor amendment in the house
 
01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:39.890 align:start position:0%
without a floor amendment in the house
so

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative
 
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.890 align:start position:0%
of the discussion yes representative
McLean

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm I'm all in favor of
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
emerging Technologies but I have to be
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
candid I I still struggle with how this
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
is going to work and really be of a
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
benefit to bring forth emerging
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
Technologies I guess I'm okay going
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
along with the committee on it but if I
 
01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:08.030 align:start position:0%
along with the committee on it but if I
could

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
if you could maybe just give me a better
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this actually moves
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
the ball forward and this structure does
 
01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:15.349 align:start position:0%
the ball forward and this structure does
that

01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that question
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
some of the areas within here would
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
actually allow us to address part of
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
what we've identified recently as gaps
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
we had had some safety risks that were
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
not appreciated until after after some
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
people's lives had been lost I actually
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
did change that other language because
 
01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:40.099 align:start position:0%
we had had the one about
 
01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
basically about non non-competes and
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
that was far too close and it was
 
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
absolutely a different tasking and
 
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.789 align:start position:0%
absolutely a different tasking and
um

01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
so I amended on the second page line 10
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
and 11 to say of the things that are
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
reviewed policies laws are
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rules which impact the
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
public disclosure or withholding of
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
safety concerns surrounding emerging
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies we passed on a bill
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
to have the
 
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.970 align:start position:0%
to have the
um

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
the transparency advocate for the parent
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
for the patients to go to the Board of
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
Medicine this would be another way to if
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's anything that comes up where
 
01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
there may be a policy from one of the
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
boards of medicine or there may be a
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
rule or there may be a law that is
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
harmful that we can look and address
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
those with and get into those
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
discussions before we get into a bill
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
drafting situation so we can make sure
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
that it's targeted and and I I do have
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
yes and so it can let us get ahead of
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
those situations it also can look at
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
removing barriers for access to emerging
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
um in the original draft that
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
specifically was targeting a lot of the
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
reimbursement issues but there's more
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
than that too it's also making sure that
 
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
with the expanded clinical trials that
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
we mentioned on line 29 that we're
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
bringing these to the community settings
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
and not just academic centers because
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
that's where most people are treated
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and that's one of
 
01:04:03.289 --> 01:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
the best ways to get these treatments
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
out when you have something that's
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
related to biomarkers it's very rare so
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
you need to cast a very very wide net
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
and you need to find those patients
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
where they are this also would be a way
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
to expand the industry base here in New
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for medical devices
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
biotechnology a lot of those there were
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
there was some manufacturing that was
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
happening up near Dartmouth that is no
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
longer happening and it would be good to
 
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
see if that's simply a market change or
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
if any of our laws are the ones that are
 
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
pushing these these businesses out
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
because I would like to see a robust and
 
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
thriving biotech can device industry up
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
here there's so much talent down in
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I say we let people work
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire instead of having
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
to commute so that would be another
 
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity for this it's it basically
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
says there's lots of opportunities what
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
can we do that's good
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
and so the one of the things that
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
representative Leon said in there is is
 
01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.589 align:start position:0%
representative Leon said in there is is
uh

01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
the idea of safety and some technologies
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
are pushed in advance of what where they
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
are actually effective and so this would
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
be another great thing for this
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee to look at
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative Shapiro
 
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
I would just say that now that I'm clear
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
what a biomarker is
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
that my daughter
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
is alive today because she's been
 
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:29.780 align:start position:0%
treated with a you know a gene specific
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
medication a gene targeted medication
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
so I know it's fantastically expensive
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
she has insurance that pays for it
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
and the idea that someone wouldn't get
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
that or that there'd be some obstacle to
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
people getting that
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
um we shouldn't let that happen
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask the Clark Hollow
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
role a motion is ought to pass on
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%

01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I move ought to pass is
 
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:03.980 align:start position:0%
amended by Amendment
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
934h on House Bill 323.
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
is there a second representative
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy I think seconded
 
01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:14.339 align:start position:0%
first but
 
01:07:14.339 --> 01:07:15.130 align:start position:0%
first but
um

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:15.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
did you okay no this uh essentially
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
replaces the the amendment we just
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
passed replaced the core I think the
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
acceptance of it hopefully means
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the entire Bill passing
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you of the discussion
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
saying none Mr Clark are you ready I am
 
01:07:38.569 --> 01:07:38.579 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead uh motion is auto pass is
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 323.
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative Leon yes representative
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
Cushman yes represent Bill King yes

representative Shapiro yes
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
representative priest yes
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy yes
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer yes

representative Howard
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
and representative McDonald yes 20-0
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
there's no objection we'll put us on the
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
this time I know there's a number of
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendments we are still waiting on so
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I would like to ask that we recess
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
for about 15 minutes and see if we can
 
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient time Adam Vice
 
01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:55.669 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient time Adam Vice
chairman

01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think that should be time to collect
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
any amendments that are upstairs and
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
shake the bushes to make sure that we're
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
getting them as quickly as that we can
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
so I think if we come back at 11 does
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
that work for you okay okay we'll be in
 
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:40.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.679 --> 01:11:07.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%

foreign

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh reconvene and um
 
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.910 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh reconvene and um
yeah

01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
406. okay uh and let's proceed to House
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 406 and
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
um representative representative you
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
want to make a motion on that
 
01:30:09.010 --> 01:30:09.020 align:start position:0%
yes I move to retain House Bill 406.
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative McLean seconds
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon uh representative
 
01:30:19.490 --> 01:30:19.500 align:start position:0%
profile did you want to speak to your
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
motion sure
 
01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
um so I am moving to retain my own bill
 
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:24.649 align:start position:0%
um so I am moving to retain my own bill
um

01:30:24.649 --> 01:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:24.659 --> 01:30:26.350 align:start position:0%
um
because

01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
Ms manahan has brought some additional
 
01:30:30.649 --> 01:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
information to light over the weekend
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:34.139 align:start position:0%
that calls into question the need for
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think requires further
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
consideration as to how we would do this
 
01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I was prepared to bring forth an
 
01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.290 align:start position:0%
so I was prepared to bring forth an
amendment

01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
um that would
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
clarify well which would add web portal
 
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:49.209 align:start position:0%
clarify well which would add web portal
access

01:30:49.209 --> 01:30:49.219 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
because apparently currently the the
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
issue in question with the Elliott
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
letter and Elliott hospital is not the
 
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.510 align:start position:0%
letter and Elliott hospital is not the
only

01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
organization that does this I believe
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Dartmouth Hitchcock does as
 
01:31:03.239 --> 01:31:04.610 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Dartmouth Hitchcock does as
well

01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
restricts parental access to certain
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
medical records of a minor child once
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
they turn 12. if the parent wants full
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
access they have a rate under HIPAA they
 
01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
have they have a right to access their
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
child's medical records
 
01:31:24.370 --> 01:31:24.380 align:start position:0%
but the the
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
organizations are making it more
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
difficult to do that in other words the
 
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
parent has to file a formal written
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
request they have to get it on CD or USB
 
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
drive or paper from the hospital or or
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider
 
01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.149 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider
um

01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
what what Ms minnehan has pointed out is
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
that they're under the cures act there
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
was something called the information
 
01:31:47.639 --> 01:31:49.850 align:start position:0%
was something called the information
blocking

01:31:49.850 --> 01:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
blocking
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
um or it restricts what they call
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
information blocking and that just uh
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
this past October HHS issued a rule with
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
respect to the information blocking
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
statute which which would make it
 
01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:09.770 align:start position:0%
statute which which would make it
um

01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
it basically says you you as a
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider you cannot put
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
barriers in the way of somebody having
 
01:32:19.209 --> 01:32:19.219 align:start position:0%
access to information
 
01:32:22.729 --> 01:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
so it appears it and we'll have to see
 
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
how that plays out at the federal level
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
and how the nuances of that play out but
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
it appears that as the blocking rule
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
goes into effect that may resolve the
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
issue the amendment that I brought or
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
that I was prepared to bring forward
 
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
would have added web portals and again
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
Ms minnehan suggested that that would
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
take some time to implement because if
 
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
the portal is currently
 
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:50.540 align:start position:0%
are not
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
designed to
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
slice and dice information at a granular
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
to to comply with with the law and the
 
01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
amendment as written that would take
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
some time to develop and it would mean
 
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
that we'd basically be putting them out
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
of compliance until they can get that
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
done so I I don't want this bill to go
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
away but I do think that we need some
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
time to
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
um to see how things play out and I
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
believe that you know there are several
 
01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
other bills in play right now including
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 10 which would potentially
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
impact parental access to medical
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
records so I think that the prudent
 
01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
thing to do at this point is to retain
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
this one and revisit it if and when
 
01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:35.689 align:start position:0%
this one and revisit it if and when
necessary

01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:38.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
um

01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um while I well
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
when I practice as a mental health
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
clinician I was totally committed to
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
working with families and families being
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
part of the situation intuitively when I
 
01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
first heard about this bill I would have
 
01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
probably been against it
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
um so I really just want to compliment
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative kofold for being like
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so thorough and so careful about
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
including all the exceptions initially
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
that are already in federal law and
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
state law working collaboratively with
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
um you know really just doing incredible
 
01:34:20.209 --> 01:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
work to make it um
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
to you know to make the the point that
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
parents should be involved while taking
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
into consideration all the nuances I
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your effort
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you

seeing none I'll ask Clark to call the
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%

01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
of which copies have been distributed
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
before but additional copies are going
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
around now
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%

hey is there a second to that over the
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
end of lay on seconds
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative profile do you want to
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yes so again
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
this this does not
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
um this is the same amendment that was
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
passed out
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
at the I believe at the end of the
 
01:36:33.239 --> 01:36:34.430 align:start position:0%
at the I believe at the end of the
hearing

01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.030 align:start position:0%
hearing
um

01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
when I presented this bill
 
01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:38.689 align:start position:0%
when I presented this bill
um

01:36:38.689 --> 01:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
part of what I think
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
was of concern is that the statute
 
01:36:46.199 --> 01:36:46.910 align:start position:0%
was of concern is that the statute
um

01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
is not the statute that that authorizes
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking with respect to Foster family
 
01:36:52.679 --> 01:36:54.290 align:start position:0%
rulemaking with respect to Foster family
homes

01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:55.250 align:start position:0%
homes
um

01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
it it may not necessarily
 
01:36:58.739 --> 01:37:00.129 align:start position:0%
it it may not necessarily
authorize

01:37:00.129 --> 01:37:00.139 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
DHHS to impose immunization requirements
 
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
in that statute I think as the original
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
bill was written it seemed to validate
 
01:37:10.689 --> 01:37:10.699 align:start position:0%
the assertion that that
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
Authority was being granted or is being
 
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
granted by current statute this rewards
 
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
essentially rewards the same
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the the same intentions that are in
 
01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:24.020 align:start position:0%
the Bill without necessarily affirming
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
or giving cause to validate that
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
Authority under under current statute
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:35.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
yes

01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman and representative cofult
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
um that I don't know about whether it's
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
specifically about the amendment but I I
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
put in because there's a concern about
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
foster homes and actually the perhaps
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
the biological parents of the foster
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
parents or other kids that are not
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
foster parents living in the home having
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
to take more vaccinations than is
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the school vaccination list
 
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:09.530 align:start position:0%
on the school vaccination list
um

01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this would say that they did that
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be required to do that
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
but could dcyf or the placing agency if
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
there was a particular medical issue
 
01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:25.139 align:start position:0%
could could the placing agency like dcyf
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
say that they're not going to put the
 
01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
child there because the children are not
 
01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or would this Force dcyf to
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
place the child in that foster home in
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
any case even if there was a specific
 
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:39.010 align:start position:0%
any case even if there was a specific
medical

01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:39.020 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
vulnerability related to
 
01:38:44.570 --> 01:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
those vaccinations
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
I have to confess I don't know enough
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
about placement processes my assumption
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:52.790 align:start position:0%
is that
um

01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
that DHHS has the latitude to judge
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not a foster home is
 
01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate whether that
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
whether they have to cite a specific
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
rule in in making that judgment is is
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
not something I know but I would assume
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
that they would have that that Latitude
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if anyone else in the
 
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure I have the answer
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
either but I serve as a court appointed
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
special Advocate and as such I have been
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
involved a number of times with
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
placement and replacement of children
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I certainly know that the department
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
has latitude to change a foster
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
placement when the child is not
 
01:39:45.239 --> 01:39:46.750 align:start position:0%
placement when the child is not
prospering

01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
prospering
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
and I know that they do work very hard
 
01:39:52.139 --> 01:39:54.709 align:start position:0%
and I know that they do work very hard
at

01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:39:54.719 --> 01:39:56.169 align:start position:0%
at
um

01:39:56.169 --> 01:39:56.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
matching the child to the home
 
01:40:01.129 --> 01:40:01.139 align:start position:0%
sometimes with greater success and
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes with less success because of
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
the lack of foster homes which I know
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt talked to us about
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
01:40:10.139 --> 01:40:11.270 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
um

01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
I started out by
 
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
being opposed to this formulation
 
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.649 align:start position:0%
being opposed to this formulation
because

01:40:20.649 --> 01:40:20.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
we ask homes where we place foster
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
children to jump through many Hoops that
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
we would not
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
that a a natural parent or a guardian
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
would simply be able to decide for
 
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.930 align:start position:0%
would simply be able to decide for
themselves

01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking that the more I read
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
this language and the more I listen to
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative kovalt's explanations of
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
it the more I'm persuaded that this is
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
not a bad way to go
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:52.139 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
I would just say that my one concern was
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
the question I asked and it's hard for
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
me to believe that the DC
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
dcyf would be forced to place a child
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
right even if there was a medical danger
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
or keep a child in a home even if
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
there's a medical danger so assuming
 
01:41:12.649 --> 01:41:12.659 align:start position:0%
that that's not the case
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't really see why
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
um just because you're becoming a
 
01:41:19.370 --> 01:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
licensed foster home that your kids
 
01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
should have to have more than the
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
regular precautionary vaccines so I I'm
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm likely to vote for it and
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and just as a
 
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up I think that that also gives
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh dcyf the option of placing
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
a child in a foster home that the that
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
the parent of the child being placed
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
might be comfortable with as well so I I
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
think I'm fine with it
 
01:41:54.110 --> 01:41:54.120 align:start position:0%

01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
20230577h so
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
this has been made in
 
01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
any discussion do you want to speak to
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
that motion representative uh once again
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
I think we've probably had enough
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
discussions okay thank you
 
01:43:41.450 --> 01:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
saying not ask at the collaro motion is
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh Mr chairman if it
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
would be helpful um does anybody from
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
the committee want to hear some answers
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we had had about the foster homes
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
and about the rule changes from a
 
01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative of the department or are
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
we satisfied to pass this assuming that
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's no flaws that the Department's
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
as long as somebody's here if you have a
 
01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:17.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.219 --> 01:44:21.609 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:44:21.609 --> 01:44:21.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Abby Rogers I'm
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative liaison for the division
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
of Public Health Services I'll represent
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm here
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I can try to answer some of your
 
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
questions related to vaccination I am
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
not representative of dcyf uh but I'd be
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
happy to try to help with your question
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
that you had
 
01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead representative
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
so the question really is
 
01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:45.109 align:start position:0%
so the question really is
um

01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
would dcyf or if it was a different
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
placing agency that contracted with dcyf
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
would they have the latitude to
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
um if we pass this bill and children in
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
foster homes biological children and
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
Foster homes didn't have to have these
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
extra vaccines with dcyf or the
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
Contracting placing agencies have the
 
01:45:08.689 --> 01:45:08.699 align:start position:0%
latitude to not Place children in the in
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
that particular home if there was a
 
01:45:13.129 --> 01:45:13.139 align:start position:0%
particular medical vulnerability
 
01:45:13.139 --> 01:45:13.970 align:start position:0%
particular medical vulnerability
um

01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
that would arise sure thank you for the
 
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is that
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
currently due to licensing standards and
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
certain requirements that certainly
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
children under the age of six I believe
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
are need to be in a home that currently
 
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
under current standards rate that uh the
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
Foster family is vaccinated and also uh
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
children with special medical needs also
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
have different requirements for having
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
those vaccination requirements in place
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
I do believe there are some licensing
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
regulations and federal requirements
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
that would stipulate that
 
01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:46.189 align:start position:0%
that would stipulate that
um

01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
and I would just share remind the
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee of testimony provided
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
previously that the requirements of
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
foster family
 
01:45:57.169 --> 01:45:57.179 align:start position:0%
children specifically related to this I
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
believe in homes being vaccinated has to
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
do with the fact that some foster
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
children are placed in homes either
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
partially vaccinated or under vaccinated
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
due to asip requirements either because
 
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
the um the parent or the biological
 
01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
parent is unable to be located that that
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
parent our Guardian are the only people
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
that can say that your child that the
 
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
child can be vaccinated if you will so
 
01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:23.060 align:start position:0%
if in lieu of that this this sort of
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
requirement of having uh the the Foster
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
family vaccinated really serves as a
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
safety net for those under-vaccinated
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
children the only way I believe to
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
vaccinate an under vaccinated child if
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
the biological parent is not available
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
is through a court order so I think this
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
serves as a little bit of a protection
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism for those children coming into
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
a home
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
I think the tenor of what I heard from
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and I'll just put
 
01:46:58.729 --> 01:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
it in my own as my own question
 
01:46:58.739 --> 01:47:02.030 align:start position:0%
it in my own as my own question
uh

01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.810 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.129 --> 01:47:09.139 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this piece of legislation
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
it still requires the list of
 
01:47:13.679 --> 01:47:14.629 align:start position:0%
it still requires the list of
um

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh immunizations under 141c and it it
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
also includes the exemptions but would
 
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
the department not be free to pick and
 
01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
choose among foster homes to fit the
 
01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
right child with the right placement so
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
if you have a child with medical needs
 
01:47:33.890 --> 01:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
if you have a child under a certain age
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the guidelines
 
01:47:38.109 --> 01:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
exclude this particular Foster Family
 
01:47:40.609 --> 01:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
you would simply go on and look at the
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
next Foster family I believe that's the
 
01:47:44.689 --> 01:47:44.699 align:start position:0%
case I do understand there is a there is
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
a you know not a huge amount of foster
 
01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
families as we as we talked about so
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
right if more we're choosing to um you
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
know not be vaccinated then that might
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
be a problem if you have a list of homes
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
and that you can't match up but I I
 
01:48:00.250 --> 01:48:00.260 align:start position:0%
understand your question and yes and
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up the countervailing
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
concern that we heard was people who
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
might choose not to be foster families
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
if they're required to get right
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations so this sort of allows
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
people to turn either way yes exactly
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I would say that not as not being a
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative of dcyf the licensing
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
requirements uh you know those are
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
specific to the agency and I can't
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
represent those here too sure thank you
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
01:48:32.209 --> 01:48:32.219 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
um you said as
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the reasoning that you just
 
01:48:42.590 --> 01:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
gave for why the policy is as is now but
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
you also said that if this bill was
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
passed that there might it might be some
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
kind of conflict with Federal
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
Regulations about licensing foster homes
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:54.179 align:start position:0%
or maybe this is outside of your school
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
a little bit out to my purview but I
 
01:48:57.169 --> 01:48:57.179 align:start position:0%
will say that you know my colleague Beth
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
marginson who's the legislative liaison
 
01:49:01.010 --> 01:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
for the uh for dcyf did indicate that
 
01:49:02.570 --> 01:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
there would be some some licensing
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
issues uh related with requirements
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
there are federal requirements so again
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's not my purview but I am aware
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
that there could be some conflicts there
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
representative profile uh yes my
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the Federal
 
01:49:17.649 --> 01:49:17.659 align:start position:0%
Regulations require that the state
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
recommend the vaccinations
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
in under these circumstances
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
but it does not require that the state
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
require them
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
right so to follow up on that um through
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations federally asip is
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the agency that requires that sets the
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
vaccination requirements and as we
 
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
tested by previously on vaccination
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
bills that New Hampshire currently only
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
requires 17 10 of the 17 requirements
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
then that would be under one RSA 141c20a
 
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
so we actually recommend less and do not
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
currently recommend all of the ones that
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
are recommended by asip for for school
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
and child care and also I believe for uh
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
for foster families
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
representative profile just just to
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
clarify though but
 
01:50:15.169 --> 01:50:15.179 align:start position:0%
the rule currently for foster homes is
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
that the affected people in the
 
01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:20.390 align:start position:0%
that the affected people in the
household

01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.430 --> 01:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
basically everyone in the household has
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
to be immunized with the entire
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
recommended asip schedule
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
with an exception and the exception is
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
because of the emergency rule issued by
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
DHHS in November which expires soon and
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
can't be renewed
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
covet is Exempted
 
01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.570 align:start position:0%
covet is Exempted
for

01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
everyone in the household and because of
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
the freedom and immunizations act the
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine is Exempted for the foster
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
children who are receiving a state
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
benefit because you can't be required to
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
take the coveted vaccine in exchange for
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
a state benefit so
 
01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.510 align:start position:0%
a state benefit so
the

01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
the the I think what I heard you say is
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
that not all of the asip schedule
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
vaccines are required for people in
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
foster homes and my understanding is
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
that yes they are
 
01:51:18.169 --> 01:51:18.179 align:start position:0%
um with that one exception on the
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
emergency rule which is the coveted
 
01:51:21.410 --> 01:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that expires after six
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
months which puts us at I think another
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
six weeks or so well maybe less and it
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
can't be renewed so I think that that
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
essentially comes back
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
unless there's a permanent rule change
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
to exclude the covid vaccine yes um
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
that's true the covid-19 vaccine is not
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
required uh and I can't speak to the
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
update on the rulemaking but I certainly
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
can provide the committee with that but
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that dcyf is working on that
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yes um I'm going
 
01:51:54.169 --> 01:51:54.179 align:start position:0%
to vote for this because I think it's
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
reasonable and because I think
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
um my experience with the foster care
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
system is that it's an incredibly
 
01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
challenging job already and it's
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
difficult to find people and in spite of
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
people talking very dismissively about
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
foster homes that they're just in it for
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
the money they don't really get much
 
01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
money so I I want to make it easier for
 
01:52:15.890 --> 01:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
those homes so I'm going to vote for
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
this and I would just suggest that Ms
 
01:52:19.139 --> 01:52:20.890 align:start position:0%
this and I would just suggest that Ms
Rogers

01:52:20.890 --> 01:52:20.900 align:start position:0%
Rogers
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know alert people who are more
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
directly related to dcyf that if there's
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
really like if this is going to really
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
cause a conflict with the federal
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
regulations that they arrive at the
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
Senate when there's a hearing on this to
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
really work that out but I'm going to
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
vote for it today thank you thank you Ms
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
Rogers for coming up
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
other than yes representative McLean I
 
01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:46.199 align:start position:0%
would just make an anecdotal statement I
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
have a colleague at work his wife's a
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
social worker so they have two foster
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
children two boys and so they have to go
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
through a pretty aggressive immunization
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
schedule to for because they also have a
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
son a young son and so they say dcyf has
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
been very good with us in terms of
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
spacing this out and I said well what if
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
you know covid was to suddenly be
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
dropped in he says at that point he says
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
that's a deal breaker he says my wife
 
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
and I we're both vaccinated but we're
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
not ready to take that step for our
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
young son and so unfortunately that
 
01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:21.659 align:start position:0%
would take us out of the the program so
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's just an anecdotal note
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you of the discussion
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
saying none I'll ask Clark to call the
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
wall the motion is ought to pass as
 
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:36.540 align:start position:0%

01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay next up for our consideration today
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
is uh house bill 642.
 
01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:04.790 align:start position:0%
is uh house bill 642.
and

01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's two amendments that are being
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
one is from representative Leon and
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that they're in Conflict
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
I woke up on Saturday morning realized I
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
well we have to vote on them separately
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
we do but we don't have to we can
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:13.490 --> 01:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:14.510 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's been suggested that we just have a
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
general discussion before we actually
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
move either Amendment representative
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
Weber do you want to speak to yours
 
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes I I submitted mine in a panic on
 
01:56:29.570 --> 01:56:29.580 align:start position:0%
Saturday when I said realized that I
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
thought I had said I would get an
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and I had completely spaced it
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
out until I was filling out my records
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
of what we did last week
 
01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
uh the approach that my Amendment takes
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
is it removes
 
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:44.350 align:start position:0%
is it removes
um

01:56:44.350 --> 01:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
in section one it removes the first two
 
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
sentences and leaves only the last one
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
which says the department shall use
 
01:56:56.570 --> 01:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
existing budget Appropriations to
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
negotiate reasonable wages and
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate service budgets with area
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
agencies and service providers
 
01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
and I I changed the title of that
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
section to budget reallocation for
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable wages and budget Services
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
rather than the original which was
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
prohibiting salad salary limits so that
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
was just a real Bare Bones reallocation
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
of the amount of money available
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
so I would over to representative Leon
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
for hers
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you Mr
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
Weber for putting that in I woke up
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
Sunday morning saying this flexibility
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
is really really good but maybe we only
 
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
want to have it for a certain amount of
 
01:57:39.290 --> 01:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
time apparently a busy week
 
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
so so my motivation and just putting
 
01:57:46.129 --> 01:57:46.139 align:start position:0%
um having this with um effective repeal
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
would be that because there's a whole
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment going on of this process
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
that this would be a bit of an
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
encouragement to within the next four
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
years actually complete that
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment and to put an end on that
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
flexibility because the idea of just
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
shifting budgets around in perpetuity is
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
a little scary but the idea of doing it
 
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
in these next few next few years as
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make the system work for
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
our most
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
our most deserving people in this state
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
yes represented Weber my question is as
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
drafted and I I have no problem with the
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
repeal I think that that's probably
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
sensible we want to get this into the
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
budget process rather than piecemeal uh
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the first sentences you
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
have drafted it means that they can only
 
01:58:37.739 --> 01:58:39.290 align:start position:0%
have drafted it means that they can only
allocate

01:58:39.290 --> 01:58:39.300 align:start position:0%
allocate
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
existing budget allocations to those
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
over 24 months and if so was that your
 
01:58:45.599 --> 01:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
over 24 months and if so was that your
intent

01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
as I was going through I remembered them
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
saying that without recognizing the
 
01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
older budgets it was very hard to have a
 
01:59:01.850 --> 01:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
reason for redetermination and that
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
there's some budgets that are 20 years
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
old and unless there is a situational
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
life change it's hard for that they
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
don't have a reason to review the budget
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
and so that appeared to me to be one of
 
01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
the things that was important in order
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
to keep that flexibility
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
um quite frankly this is an area that is
 
01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:23.420 align:start position:0%
a bit hard for me to fully understand
 
01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I I thought that simply removing
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
that part on the wage caps which we do
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
not have was probably the best path
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
forward but I'm open to either one
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with the inclusion
 
01:59:40.729 --> 01:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
there I just
 
01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
as I read this quickly
 
01:59:46.129 --> 01:59:46.139 align:start position:0%
I wonder if
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
that first sentence means
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody would read that
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh to mean that you can only do the
 
01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
reallocation for those over than 24
 
01:59:58.260 --> 01:59:59.530 align:start position:0%
reallocation for those over than 24
months

01:59:59.530 --> 01:59:59.540 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think that perhaps the way around that
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
would be to draft
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
a committee report that states that we
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
want all budgets to participate uh not
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
those older than 24 months or those
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
younger than 24 months so that at least
 
02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
we have clarified for the record that it
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
was our intent here to allow that
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
reallocation to happen with all the
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
budgets not just
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
the older than 24-month budgets and
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm really glad you put in
 
02:00:36.599 --> 02:00:37.609 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I'm really glad you put in
that

02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
that point because it certainly is a
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
sticking point for many many people and
 
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
as long as we're both agreed that we're
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
saying what we think we're saying I
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
really appreciate the work on it
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
I've done a bland you have anything
 
02:00:57.169 --> 02:00:57.179 align:start position:0%
further yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate your
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
work in trying to get us the solution as
 
02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
well I think that including that in the
 
02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:05.219 align:start position:0%
report I believe you have far more
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this process I believe that
 
02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's adequate to show our intent thank
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:17.420 align:start position:0%
okay other discussion yes representative
 
02:01:20.050 --> 02:01:20.060 align:start position:0%
although this is my fifth year here
 
02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
bypassing both of these amendments
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're not in conflict with each other
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
no I would not offer my amendment I
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
would I would I would offer my second to
 
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's Amendment we
 
02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
drafted them separately over the weekend
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
without any consultation so we don't
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
need both of them I feel guilty I read
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.370 --> 02:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
well if you'd if you drafted another
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
amendment it would be a little more
 
02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:54.300 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay with that uh representative land

02:03:16.370 --> 02:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
20 to zero
 
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay a motion now before us would
 
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
presumably be ought to pass as amended
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
amended a house bill 642 representative
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
Palazzo would you like to make a motion
 
02:03:29.410 --> 02:03:29.420 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I I move uh
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
octopus's Amendment
 
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a second second
 
02:03:35.209 --> 02:03:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative web of seconds
 
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative do you want to speak to
 
02:03:39.109 --> 02:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
that motion or
 
02:03:42.410 --> 02:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh I think we covered it enough but I
 
02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill that can help
 
02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
with current uh crisis of uh Workforce
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
shortage and inflation when uh rates in
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
the market go go up and because we have
 
02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
actually some funds that were not spent
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
available it's a good measure to help
 
02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:10.619 align:start position:0%
people thank you
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes I I I'd like to ask somebody
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
who understands this better than me
 
02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:20.570 align:start position:0%
who understands this better than me
um

02:04:20.570 --> 02:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
makes me a little nervous when I don't
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
fully understand something and I have to
 
02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
put on it so can somebody give an
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
example if we pass this bill what will
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
happen that doesn't happen right now
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
so this was in
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
something that I asked at Health and
 
02:04:42.250 --> 02:04:42.260 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
currently we have a certain amount of
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
money allocated
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
and only 60 percent of the allocated
 
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
positions are full
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
so we have 40 percent of the money
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
allocated for people
 
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
for all the people who are reserving
 
02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
services and right now everything's very
 
02:05:06.109 --> 02:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
fluid on what gets funded but the
 
02:05:08.930 --> 02:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
current bar is not that the legislature
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't funded adequately it hasn't but
 
02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough people to do the
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
jobs either and so I asked at that time
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
G if we could take some of the money
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
that isn't being expended
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
and use it to raise salaries so that we
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
could get the rate of people being
 
02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
served up to 80 percent of the services
 
02:05:35.699 --> 02:05:37.310 align:start position:0%
served up to 80 percent of the services
and

02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
the formulation here keeps it within the
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
original allocation the monies that have
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
already been allocated to these people
 
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
in these Services globally it allows a
 
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
in these Services globally it allows a
redistribution

02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
redistribution
 
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
um to individuals and then with respect
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
to representative Leon's drafting of her
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment because you get a budget when
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
you start these services and it never
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
changes it doesn't change for inflation
 
02:06:12.850 --> 02:06:12.860 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change for anything
 
02:06:16.250 --> 02:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
the hope is that some of this could also
 
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
the hope is that some of this could also
be

02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
used towards
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
um people who have the older budgets and
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
are very restricted I think the and
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong the intent of of
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
both of us is to take the full pot of
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
money that's available and make sure
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's being used for services rather than
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
sitting unused
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
and then the goal also for both of us I
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
think going forward is this needs to be
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
addressed in the budget but with all of
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the uh up in the air about how things
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
are going to look and what the services
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
are going to pay for all this does is
 
02:06:57.129 --> 02:06:57.139 align:start position:0%
say you can spread the existing pot
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
slightly differently
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you it seems like a brilliant
 
02:07:04.250 --> 02:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment and a brilliant bill
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
oops another discussion
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Murphy thank you I
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
have a question and it was just raised
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
in my head when representative Weber
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
said what she said and I just want to be
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
if we currently only have about 60
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the positions filled doing
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
the work that needs to be done and we've
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
allocated for 100 people and then we
 
02:07:26.209 --> 02:07:26.219 align:start position:0%
take or whatever that number is and we
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
take all the excess monies and support
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
those that are doing the work
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
does and I'm always conscious when we
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
create budgets that you don't want to
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
put a tail on whatever we do today down
 
02:07:40.010 --> 02:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
the road in a burden so does this mean
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
that the monies the excess monies that
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
help current employees and agencies or
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
people that provide services will this
 
02:07:51.649 --> 02:07:51.659 align:start position:0%
mean a tale so that we cannot hire the
 
02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
others and does it then if you do hire
 
02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:57.179 align:start position:0%
more people will it increase or inflate
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
the budget in the allocating dollars
 
02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
necessary well we're in a budget cycle
 
02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
right now so the next budget is going to
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
be whatever budget Writers Do and as we
 
02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
hear often hear we can't actually bind
 
02:08:14.089 --> 02:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
the next legislature
 
02:08:16.570 --> 02:08:16.580 align:start position:0%
um you know we've had policies that have
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
gone on forever we're in a period of
 
02:08:23.089 --> 02:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
upheaval and the answer is I don't know
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
but I know that there's money there now
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
and there are people who need Services
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
now and if we paid a little more to the
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
doing Services now we could retain them
 
02:08:34.850 --> 02:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
rather than having them go somewhere
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
else and maybe attract a few more so as
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
imperfect as it is I'm willing to give
 
02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
it a try and
 
02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:45.169 align:start position:0%
it a try and
um

02:08:45.169 --> 02:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
and as representative Leon has done it's
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
it's there's a repeal on this in 2027 so
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
if we've got it very wrong that's the
 
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
drop dead date but I think you're going
 
02:08:57.550 --> 02:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
to find it's going to be limited by
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
whatever the budget writers do in the
 
02:09:03.709 --> 02:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
budget going forward thank you
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
very much in favor
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
ability to provides I was trying to
 
02:09:08.689 --> 02:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
understand the future consequences
 
02:09:11.330 --> 02:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
that's also so thank you
 
02:09:14.330 --> 02:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
a saying none I'll ask the to call
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%

02:09:22.729 --> 02:09:22.739 align:start position:0%

there's no objection we'll put that on
 
02:10:19.370 --> 02:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
next up for our consideration is House
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 317 representative Cushman did you
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
yes I would move that HB 317 be retained
 
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:10:38.209 --> 02:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
I heard a second
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Weber seconds
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cushman did you want
 
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
sure I think we just have a lot going on
 
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
with this system right now and it would
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
be good to keep this bill
 
02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
be good to keep this bill
um

02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
in case you know as we see what what
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
comes with the systems redesign what's
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to happen over the summer and
 
02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
um we have the other bill for the pilot
 
02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:05.629 align:start position:0%
um we have the other bill for the pilot
program

02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
this is just a little premature and we
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
can hold on to it and see what changes
 
02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:11.099 align:start position:0%
come and if we need to work on it or if
 
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
we even need it later
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you another discussion yes
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and I would just
 
02:11:19.609 --> 02:11:19.619 align:start position:0%
add that having the retained bill means
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
we can work on it and get it out to the
 
02:11:24.370 --> 02:11:24.380 align:start position:0%
senate in January so it can move quickly
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
if speed is necessary it's kind of an
 
02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:28.370 align:start position:0%
if speed is necessary it's kind of an
interim

02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
interim
 
02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
interim stop so
 
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you of the discussion
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
being done I will ask the clerk to call
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%

02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%

um but that is not here yet right let me
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Leon correct we
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
are waiting to have printed an amendment
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
on 136
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and we have a total of five bills
 
02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:54.890 align:start position:0%
um and we have a total of five bills
left

02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
left
 
02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:56.149 align:start position:0%
left
okay

02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:57.709 --> 02:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
um there's no objection perhaps lunch
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
would be in order
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
to adjourn until a recess until one
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
o'clock or ten minutes of one
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
which one uh one o'clock
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
make a nice round number
 
03:30:24.889 --> 03:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to reconvene
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
the executive session for the committee
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
on Health and Human Services and elderly
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
Affairs and as we resume I'd like to
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
begin with House Bill 136
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative Leon did you want to move
 
03:30:42.410 --> 03:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
make a motion uh thank you Mr chairman I
 
03:30:47.050 --> 03:30:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.229 --> 03:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
2023-0949h to house bill 136.
 
03:30:54.429 --> 03:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.450 --> 03:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Weber
 
03:30:58.130 --> 03:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative land do you want to speak
 
03:30:59.809 --> 03:30:59.819 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes thank you very
 
03:30:59.819 --> 03:31:00.830 align:start position:0%
to your motion um yes thank you very
much

03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
um this is a amendment that I worked on
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
with representative Merchant in order to
 
03:31:06.769 --> 03:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were addressing the
 
03:31:10.429 --> 03:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
desire to have collaboration in the role
 
03:31:13.250 --> 03:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
making process and be able to have that
 
03:31:15.050 --> 03:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
roll call vote either in support or
 
03:31:17.889 --> 03:31:17.899 align:start position:0%
opposition to the proposed final rule
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
this is language that would allow that
 
03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
and would allow
 
03:31:25.870 --> 03:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
this process to be a little bit more
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
have the say of this this important
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
group a little bit better represented as
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
we move towards administrative rules
 
03:31:36.530 --> 03:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
of the discussion
 
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is the work
 
03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
language that was developed by
 
03:31:45.889 --> 03:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
representative Liana representative
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
Merchant which he sent to me I have
 
03:31:51.229 --> 03:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
another amendment which actually puts a
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
period in there and rearranges the
 
03:31:55.729 --> 03:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
sentences a little bit but I don't think
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
it's worth arguing over the intent is
 
03:32:00.530 --> 03:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
entirely the same so I'm perfectly happy
 
03:32:02.330 --> 03:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
to go with this one
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon um thank you have
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
you received that from OLS yet no okay
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
not yet okay
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
I have a question to represent
 
03:32:20.570 --> 03:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
so is my understanding correct that the
 
03:32:22.130 --> 03:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
bill was uh
 
03:32:25.250 --> 03:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
about to require a roll call an
 
03:32:29.469 --> 03:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
amendment say it's just an opportunity
 
03:32:32.090 --> 03:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you the intention is to allow an
 
03:32:34.190 --> 03:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a roll call vote in
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
support or opposition and not to require
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
it but that there is an opportunity for
 
03:32:44.570 --> 03:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and it's my further
 
03:32:49.670 --> 03:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that that's not binding on
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
the department but it it's a way of
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
getting feedback to the apartment
 
03:32:53.880 --> 03:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
getting feedback to the apartment
Department

03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:02.570 --> 03:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.410 --> 03:33:05.420 align:start position:0%
I just want to say so based on my
 
03:33:08.450 --> 03:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
understanding I'm inclined to voting
 
03:33:14.090 --> 03:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:16.610 --> 03:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
so would it be possible to understand
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
which part of that was the concern or I
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
guess if maybe that's
 
03:33:25.729 --> 03:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
maybe a misunderstanding but I feel like
 
03:33:32.450 --> 03:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's what what else down the initial
 
03:33:34.809 --> 03:33:34.819 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill
 
03:33:34.819 --> 03:33:36.769 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill
by

03:33:36.769 --> 03:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:33:39.410 --> 03:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
not requiring but just providing an
 
03:33:39.420 --> 03:33:41.870 align:start position:0%
not requiring but just providing an
opportunity

03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
my feeling is like that original
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
intention was
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
like so it would be requirement and so
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
there would be a roll call vote and
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
there would be accountability and some
 
03:34:01.010 --> 03:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think first of all it was
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's Bill to begin
 
03:34:08.389 --> 03:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
with so he has agreed to this because it
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
was language that he and representative
 
03:34:14.210 --> 03:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
Leon worked on together so he's okay
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
with it and I feel free to represent
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
that because he also wrote me that this
 
03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
language was stuff that they had worked
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
on together
 
03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:24.170 align:start position:0%
on together
um

03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
my concern with the original bill was
 
03:34:33.370 --> 03:34:33.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:34:36.650 --> 03:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
we were taking away the rule making
 
03:34:36.660 --> 03:34:38.210 align:start position:0%
we were taking away the rule making
Authority

03:34:38.210 --> 03:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
the department has and it doesn't do
 
03:34:44.809 --> 03:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
that so that was my concern so the roll
 
03:34:47.570 --> 03:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
call vote that gets taken is not binding
 
03:34:49.849 --> 03:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
on the department but
 
03:34:52.729 --> 03:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
they have to listen to what people are
 
03:34:56.510 --> 03:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
saying and I think that we saw that also
 
03:34:59.170 --> 03:34:59.180 align:start position:0%
when we heard people
 
03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
who came about the system of care for
 
03:35:06.190 --> 03:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability Community
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
people want to feel that their voices
 
03:35:13.130 --> 03:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
have been heard and the answer may be no
 
03:35:13.140 --> 03:35:14.950 align:start position:0%
have been heard and the answer may be no
but

03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
as we all know when we vote in the
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
minority of any bill or other thing
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
I feel a lot better about taking it when
 
03:35:26.570 --> 03:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
I lose a vote when I feel like I've at
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
least been able to explain myself and my
 
03:35:34.849 --> 03:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
rationale and this because it was for
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the advisory Council
 
03:35:41.929 --> 03:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
I'm really comfortable leaving it up to
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
the advisory Council as to whether they
 
03:35:47.269 --> 03:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
want to vote or not they may be
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that they look at and they
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
say oh that's fine there's no need for
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
us to get together and vote because it's
 
03:35:53.399 --> 03:35:54.610 align:start position:0%
us to get together and vote because it's
okay

03:35:54.610 --> 03:35:54.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
but this allows them the opportunity to
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
get together and vote either for or
 
03:36:02.769 --> 03:36:02.779 align:start position:0%
against and presumably with whatever
 
03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
whatever kinds of comments they want to
 
03:36:08.570 --> 03:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
make so
 
03:36:11.330 --> 03:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh in that respect I
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
you're right it gives greater latitude
 
03:36:15.530 --> 03:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
to the council but I think giving
 
03:36:17.570 --> 03:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
greater latitude to the council is a
 
03:36:19.729 --> 03:36:19.739 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
I think that helps
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:26.150 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
profile

03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
profile
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I would just Echo the the
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
statements that representative Weber
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
just made
 
03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe that this
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
significantly Waters down the original
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
03:36:39.769 --> 03:36:39.779 align:start position:0%
um because it it does say that the
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
department shall provide them with an
 
03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hold a roll call vote
 
03:36:48.170 --> 03:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
which is is still binding on the
 
03:36:49.729 --> 03:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
department to at least present them with
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
that opportunity so I think it's an
 
03:36:53.349 --> 03:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
important step forward in terms of
 
03:36:56.450 --> 03:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
providing some guidance to uh to the
 
03:36:58.370 --> 03:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
department when they are making
 
03:37:01.010 --> 03:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so I will be voting
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the amendment
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
03:37:07.849 --> 03:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
so you know other discussion
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll ask the clerk to call the wall
 
03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
the vote is ought to pass on Amendment
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%

representative profile do you have a
 
03:39:49.380 --> 03:39:50.690 align:start position:0%
representative profile do you have a
motion

03:39:50.690 --> 03:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
yes I move ought to pass on House Bill
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
575. is there a second
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconds
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative profile do you want to
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion sure I think House
 
03:40:06.290 --> 03:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
Bill 575
 
03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:07.429 align:start position:0%
Bill 575
um

03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
I think raises a very important issue
 
03:40:13.150 --> 03:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
03:40:18.170 --> 03:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
we we have seen cases of uh of vaccines
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that are not that have not been through
 
03:40:24.849 --> 03:40:24.859 align:start position:0%
clinical trials
 
03:40:28.130 --> 03:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire is is uh
 
03:40:31.729 --> 03:40:31.739 align:start position:0%
is promoting and I think that uh you
 
03:40:33.889 --> 03:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
know it it deserves further conversation
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
and and that we ought to uh
 
03:40:39.530 --> 03:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
we ought to not be promoting those sorts
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
of uh those sorts of untested or
 
03:40:45.290 --> 03:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
minimally tested vaccines in the state
 
03:40:46.969 --> 03:40:46.979 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you other discussion
 
03:40:52.849 --> 03:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
chairman one of my concerns I have
 
03:40:57.530 --> 03:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
around this is that taxpayers shouldn't
 
03:40:59.210 --> 03:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
be paying for advertising that should be
 
03:41:01.610 --> 03:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
done by the pharmaceutical companies so
 
03:41:02.929 --> 03:41:02.939 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why I think
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
that this is important
 
03:41:08.090 --> 03:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
another discussion yes representative
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you on
 
03:41:12.410 --> 03:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
I will um
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
vote against this for several reasons
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
one some of the wording here I think is
 
03:41:21.650 --> 03:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
a bit odd and inappropriate voluntary
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
human clinical trials really is an
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary word you don't need
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
voluntary in fact involuntary trials
 
03:41:30.290 --> 03:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
would be actually unethical and illegal
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
03:41:34.729 --> 03:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
um if you were to have this go forward
 
03:41:34.739 --> 03:41:37.309 align:start position:0%
um if you were to have this go forward
mandating

03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
you know a clinical trial for every
 
03:41:41.210 --> 03:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
vaccine and every change in vaccine
 
03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
there will be certain significant
 
03:41:44.809 --> 03:41:44.819 align:start position:0%
negative side effects one of which would
 
03:41:44.819 --> 03:41:45.550 align:start position:0%
negative side effects one of which would
be

03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:41:49.070 --> 03:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that simply the the flu vaccine
 
03:41:52.010 --> 03:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
is would be in jeopardy with this bill
 
03:41:54.590 --> 03:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine is updated every year
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
based on the prior you know
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
symptomatology in the strain that goes
 
03:42:00.650 --> 03:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
through the population it doesn't have
 
03:42:02.210 --> 03:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
to go and doesn't go through a human
 
03:42:05.210 --> 03:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
trial so that would be a potential
 
03:42:07.490 --> 03:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would be compromised in its
 
03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:08.630 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would be compromised in its
use

03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:42:11.090 --> 03:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
um the um the folks from New Hampshire
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
hospital and even the correctional
 
03:42:15.530 --> 03:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
facilities have also stated that
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
um If This Were to go through it'd
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
really make it difficult for them to get
 
03:42:20.330 --> 03:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
vaccines to places like the correctional
 
03:42:22.490 --> 03:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire hospital and
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
those people that are in very high risk
 
03:42:26.090 --> 03:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
because of the um
 
03:42:28.490 --> 03:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
um the congregate living that they are
 
03:42:30.170 --> 03:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
living in
 
03:42:30.180 --> 03:42:31.849 align:start position:0%
living in
um

03:42:31.849 --> 03:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:33.530 --> 03:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
um the also the potential uh unintended
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
consequence is the the compassionate use
 
03:42:43.849 --> 03:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
of vaccines you know uh or any drug it
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a vaccine it could be
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
a drug an implant or any other device
 
03:42:52.849 --> 03:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
without the compassionate use of a
 
03:42:55.370 --> 03:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
vaccine that would be delayed by having
 
03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
the net by necessary by necessity to go
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
through a human clinical trial would
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
really compromise the ability of
 
03:43:04.610 --> 03:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
compassionate use and that has been done
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the past with things like muscular
 
03:43:10.490 --> 03:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
dystrophy ALS certain cancers so
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I I every vaccine every medicine
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
every product that is put into a patient
 
03:43:19.670 --> 03:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's um you know for Orthopedic
 
03:43:22.190 --> 03:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
care or whether it's a drug whether it's
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
I understand they all should be vetted
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
try it you know in in cleared in a way
 
03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:29.939 align:start position:0%
that's um protective of the patient but
 
03:43:33.050 --> 03:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
the the fact that this would mandate
 
03:43:36.170 --> 03:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
that they have to go through this um
 
03:43:39.650 --> 03:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh this um this this trial would really
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
compromise the ability to update
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
um pneumococcal vaccines
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and um for those reasons I mentioned
 
03:43:49.010 --> 03:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
above I would probably vote against it
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:43:53.090 --> 03:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative Cushman
 
03:43:55.729 --> 03:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I just want to
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
speak to the uh idea that there it's
 
03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
unethical and uh that involuntary
 
03:44:04.010 --> 03:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
clinical trials cannot take place that
 
03:44:05.690 --> 03:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
used to be the way that it was but in
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
2016 the common rule was amended and now
 
03:44:13.130 --> 03:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
um an IRB can determine that they can
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
have uh informed consent of being in a
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
clinical trial waived for a participant
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so we we can have involuntary
 
03:44:25.010 --> 03:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
um you know in involvement in a clinical
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
trial unfortunately
 
03:44:30.769 --> 03:44:30.779 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that the patients
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
um consent is you know
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh foundational in any scientific
 
03:44:39.530 --> 03:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
research and that being said we we need
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
those clinical trials if the state is
 
03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
going to get involved in promoting or or
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
purchasing or Distributing something it
 
03:44:49.969 --> 03:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
needs to have that strong Research
 
03:44:54.050 --> 03:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
Foundation and nothing will preclude the
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
companies themselves from
 
03:45:00.290 --> 03:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
um besides existing law from uh you know
 
03:45:02.210 --> 03:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
advertising and reaching out to those
 
03:45:03.650 --> 03:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people who might need the
 
03:45:03.660 --> 03:45:04.990 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people who might need the
newer

03:45:04.990 --> 03:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
newer
 
03:45:10.210 --> 03:45:10.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
03:45:13.969 --> 03:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
um was there an amendment coming on this
 
03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
to oh so I think you know absent and I I
 
03:45:23.690 --> 03:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
think we learned a lot of the wrong
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
lessons out of covid but I do think
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
though that this bill by prohibiting the
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
state from purchasing promoting and
 
03:45:36.170 --> 03:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
distributing I think it's it's just
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
incredibly Broad and I I think you know
 
03:45:39.420 --> 03:45:40.610 align:start position:0%
incredibly Broad and I I think you know
it

03:45:40.610 --> 03:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:45:43.370 --> 03:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
really limits potential course of action
 
03:45:45.170 --> 03:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
going forward I mean I
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of sympathetic on the promoted
 
03:45:51.050 --> 03:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
side but the other stuff I just I just I
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
just don't feel given the breadth of
 
03:45:54.769 --> 03:45:54.779 align:start position:0%
this bill that I can support it at this
 
03:45:54.779 --> 03:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
this bill that I can support it at this
time

03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:45:57.410 --> 03:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the other thing is I know in in
 
03:46:01.729 --> 03:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
particular in pediatric practices a lot
 
03:46:03.650 --> 03:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
of the vaccines are provided by the
 
03:46:06.290 --> 03:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
state and without that
 
03:46:08.570 --> 03:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
um a lot of families can't afford the
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines that they choose to have and
 
03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
and those include the ones that are
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
required for schools so
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
um I would want to make absolutely sure
 
03:46:19.370 --> 03:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
that that that doesn't get interfered
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
with because it could end up being a
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
large cost to patients who can't afford
 
03:46:24.120 --> 03:46:25.250 align:start position:0%
large cost to patients who can't afford
it

03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:46:29.570 --> 03:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Shapiro
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I would just like to give an
 
03:46:35.469 --> 03:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
example of um I have a family member
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
who's passed away but lived in the
 
03:46:40.190 --> 03:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
Glencliff home for probably 10 or 12
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
years prior to passing away and for for
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't know what the
 
03:46:47.929 --> 03:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home is it's run by the it's
 
03:46:50.690 --> 03:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
the only I think the only psychiatric
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home in the country that's run
 
03:46:56.690 --> 03:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
by a state so it's it's it's it's
 
03:46:59.330 --> 03:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
part of the state hospital the New
 
03:47:01.969 --> 03:47:01.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital system so in order to
 
03:47:03.710 --> 03:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
live there you have to
 
03:47:03.720 --> 03:47:04.309 align:start position:0%
live there you have to
um

03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:07.849 --> 03:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
have severe psychiatric problems
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
um severe and persistent mental illness
 
03:47:11.150 --> 03:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
and you also have to be medically
 
03:47:14.570 --> 03:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
vulnerable so my brother-in-law lived
 
03:47:16.250 --> 03:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
there for quite a long time they took
 
03:47:18.769 --> 03:47:18.779 align:start position:0%
fantastic care of him
 
03:47:18.779 --> 03:47:19.550 align:start position:0%
fantastic care of him
um

03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:21.590 --> 03:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
not that he would have ever agreed to
 
03:47:23.170 --> 03:47:23.180 align:start position:0%
take a vaccine
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
but the idea that um
 
03:47:28.490 --> 03:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have been able to
 
03:47:31.570 --> 03:47:31.580 align:start position:0%
talk to him about taking a flu vaccine
 
03:47:34.370 --> 03:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
and encouraged him to take a flu vaccine
 
03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
and give it to him if he was willing I
 
03:47:38.990 --> 03:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
think we're really
 
03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:39.969 align:start position:0%
think we're really
um

03:47:39.969 --> 03:47:39.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
compromising the care for some very
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people with this bill
 
03:47:45.479 --> 03:47:47.450 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people with this bill
um

03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:50.330 --> 03:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
so I I will vote against it thank you
 
03:47:52.969 --> 03:47:52.979 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:47:55.370 --> 03:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
and then you were getting very close to
 
03:47:56.570 --> 03:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say when you
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
referenced the Glen Cliff home but I'm
 
03:47:59.809 --> 03:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
thinking about our County nursing homes
 
03:48:02.530 --> 03:48:02.540 align:start position:0%
as well which
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
again another vulnerable and congregate
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
population that benefits very much from
 
03:48:12.290 --> 03:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
having the vaccines and the state
 
03:48:16.849 --> 03:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.650 --> 03:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative
 
03:48:18.660 --> 03:48:20.210 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative
palazzov

03:48:20.210 --> 03:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
palazzov
 
03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I will be voting uh for this bill I
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
think it's a good prudent idea to have a
 
03:48:31.790 --> 03:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
proper clinical trial before the
 
03:48:35.210 --> 03:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
government being involved so heavily in
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
medication and we are in state of Crisis
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:48:45.130 --> 03:48:45.140 align:start position:0%
mandating to certain populations this
 
03:48:47.570 --> 03:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
so-called vaccines that
 
03:48:49.849 --> 03:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily because it doesn't
 
03:48:53.690 --> 03:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
stop a transmission of
 
03:48:58.250 --> 03:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
sales cov2 and we have like in New
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have one kid who died of
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
covet and four kids who died from side
 
03:49:10.269 --> 03:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
effects after receiving this vaccine and
 
03:49:14.330 --> 03:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
there are many indications that blood
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
diseases are up and
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
certain nervous systems are up after
 
03:49:23.929 --> 03:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
introdu reduction of this and we never
 
03:49:25.490 --> 03:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
tested it
 
03:49:28.849 --> 03:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
for kids we never tested actually if
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
they benefit
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
there was no double blind status for for
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
minus and and we know that covid-19 is
 
03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
not as severe on younger population and
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
it's not the first time when
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine in the history of humanity in in
 
03:49:54.170 --> 03:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
the last 100 years that some vaccines or
 
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
medications had some unexpected side
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
effects so uh
 
03:50:04.670 --> 03:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh right now we assuming that
 
03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
flu vaccines and other vaccines don't
 
03:50:09.469 --> 03:50:09.479 align:start position:0%
need to be tested because they're always
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
good but what if some modification to
 
03:50:15.250 --> 03:50:15.260 align:start position:0%
those Technologies
 
03:50:18.490 --> 03:50:18.500 align:start position:0%
won't be beneficial and we say oh no
 
03:50:22.130 --> 03:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
don't test it so I think this bill is a
 
03:50:23.330 --> 03:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:50:28.729 --> 03:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
and while I think that representative
 
03:50:34.550 --> 03:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
Palazzo makes some very good points with
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh the uncertainties of the covid
 
03:50:42.769 --> 03:50:42.779 align:start position:0%
vaccine this is too broad because it
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
would also prohibit us from Distributing
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine every year and that's
 
03:50:49.370 --> 03:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
something that people in the County
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in Congress living in the
 
03:50:55.790 --> 03:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
prisons need but it doesn't get tested
 
03:50:57.769 --> 03:50:57.779 align:start position:0%
each year it's reformulated but it
 
03:50:59.929 --> 03:50:59.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't get tested on humans it just
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
goes straight into arms and so I think
 
03:51:08.050 --> 03:51:08.060 align:start position:0%
that as drafted this bill is over abroad
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
and although I understand the
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
protections that people might want from
 
03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:18.370 align:start position:0%
protections that people might want from
newer

03:51:18.370 --> 03:51:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.380 --> 03:51:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
product

03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
this I'm afraid will put real burdens
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
both on uh
 
03:51:30.650 --> 03:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
things like the influenza vaccine both
 
03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
for children and for for elders
 
03:51:37.070 --> 03:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the discussion representative Leon um
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:51:39.769 --> 03:51:39.779 align:start position:0%
um the question about these other
 
03:51:42.290 --> 03:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
vaccines is one that's quite interesting
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
especially when you look at the full
 
03:51:45.410 --> 03:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
approval process for things like the
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccine there are predicate
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
approvals and predicate drugs that
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
they're based off of so the initial flu
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine did have these clinical trials
 
03:51:57.889 --> 03:51:57.899 align:start position:0%
and FDA approval mechanisms allow for
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
follow-on studies and they allow for
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
certain developments and new
 
03:52:03.889 --> 03:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
introductions that are building off of
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
those studies with with voluntary human
 
03:52:10.490 --> 03:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that are conducted in a
 
03:52:13.250 --> 03:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
high quality way this actually is an
 
03:52:15.050 --> 03:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
area on the vaccine part I went to a
 
03:52:17.330 --> 03:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
vaccine conference on development of new
 
03:52:19.929 --> 03:52:19.939 align:start position:0%
vaccines back at MIT
 
03:52:23.769 --> 03:52:23.779 align:start position:0%
just after our first SARS experience and
 
03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
all of those technologies that they were
 
03:52:28.130 --> 03:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
looking at then built off predicate
 
03:52:30.830 --> 03:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines a lot of this challenge here
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
with our most recent experience with the
 
03:52:34.969 --> 03:52:34.979 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccines is that they're not
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
building off of a predicate that has
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
gone through this level of clinical
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
trial this is not the same as when you
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
have a follow-on approval it's entirely
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
different and my reading of the bill
 
03:52:49.969 --> 03:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
does not stop any of these products that
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
have a predicate approval it's not a
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
formulation change because it is still
 
03:52:56.090 --> 03:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
based off of an approval based on
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
voluntary human trials I I appreciate
 
03:53:01.190 --> 03:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we all read the bills differently
 
03:53:03.889 --> 03:53:03.899 align:start position:0%
but I read this as those predicate
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
trials are adequate to it and that we
 
03:53:08.929 --> 03:53:08.939 align:start position:0%
need to know that this at least began
 
03:53:10.969 --> 03:53:10.979 align:start position:0%
with something that had the appropriate
 
03:53:13.130 --> 03:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
balance of safety and efficacy in order
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative Reed thank you Mr
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
chairman my concern too with the vaccine
 
03:53:25.370 --> 03:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
such as the coveted vaccine is that the
 
03:53:29.450 --> 03:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
MRNA technology will be used to
 
03:53:32.090 --> 03:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
formulate our more standard vaccines
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
such as the flu vaccine and other
 
03:53:37.250 --> 03:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines will be switched to
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
an mRNA technology and I do think that
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
this might protect against that so
 
03:53:46.849 --> 03:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
um I I am in support of this I do I will
 
03:53:49.849 --> 03:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
be thank you thank you now that is
 
03:53:51.769 --> 03:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
I can understand that position much as I
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't agree with it but that's not what
 
03:54:03.290 --> 03:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
the bill says as it's drafted so
 
03:54:05.570 --> 03:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
um you know it may be a drafting error
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
but the bill is drafted doesn't have
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
those reservations in it that I can see
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
03:54:17.389 --> 03:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other discussion
 
03:54:19.130 --> 03:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
okay with that I'll ask the clerk to
 
03:54:21.710 --> 03:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
call the roll a motion is
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 575.

03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative Weber will be working on
 
03:57:30.410 --> 03:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
nobody's meeting my eye over there
 
03:57:32.210 --> 03:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
studying their shoes make sure they're
 
03:57:34.370 --> 03:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
tied properly and
 
03:57:40.250 --> 03:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay we will collaborate and thank you
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay moving on it'll be a minority
 
03:57:43.080 --> 03:57:49.610 align:start position:0%
okay moving on it'll be a minority
foreign

03:57:49.610 --> 03:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay next up is
 
03:57:51.840 --> 03:57:53.150 align:start position:0%
okay next up is
um

03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:55.849 --> 03:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
oh it's Bill 619 and representative
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
McLean did you you have an amendment for
 
03:57:58.199 --> 03:58:01.670 align:start position:0%
McLean did you you have an amendment for
that

03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:03.530 --> 03:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I did have an amendment
 
03:58:09.769 --> 03:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's not my intention to
 
03:58:13.250 --> 03:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh formally offer at this time
 
03:58:16.370 --> 03:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
um what I would prefer to do is is make
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain the bill
 
03:58:25.309 --> 03:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
and use this amendment kind of as a an
 
03:58:28.130 --> 03:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
informal springboard by which you know
 
03:58:29.590 --> 03:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
the committee that would look at it
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
could work off of I I felt that the the
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
original bill was just too broad there
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
was just too much in it so what the
 
03:58:42.290 --> 03:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it it removes
 
03:58:44.330 --> 03:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
um the part of the bill that that has to
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
do with the conversion Theory it takes
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
that conversion therapy sorry it takes
 
03:58:51.410 --> 03:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
that out it also takes out the section
 
03:58:53.450 --> 03:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
with respect to the schools and the
 
03:58:53.460 --> 03:58:55.030 align:start position:0%
with respect to the schools and the
education

03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
we have an education committee that is
 
03:59:00.650 --> 03:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
looking at a parent's Bill of Rights and
 
03:59:02.330 --> 03:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
I think that they're better equipped to
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
to have that kind of conversation
 
03:59:06.889 --> 03:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
03:59:09.410 --> 03:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
um the the findings in the amendment are
 
03:59:11.570 --> 03:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
really paired down there was a lot of
 
03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and a lot of controversy
 
03:59:16.370 --> 03:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
about the findings itself so I really
 
03:59:19.250 --> 03:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
just you know in the spirit of kind of
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
working collaborative collaboratively
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
just kind of paired all that down
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
and so really what is left
 
03:59:31.729 --> 03:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
um what I would hope as a kind of floor
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
um for study during retention would just
 
03:59:37.250 --> 03:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
be uh the gender affirming care part of
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
it and the reason for that I think is
 
03:59:43.610 --> 03:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
that when I I heard the testimony
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
um presented in the committee we heard
 
03:59:49.490 --> 03:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
from glad we heard from the ACLU
 
03:59:51.889 --> 03:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
and very importantly we heard from
 
03:59:54.769 --> 03:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock and what I heard
 
03:59:57.590 --> 03:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
stated over and over again was that the
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care really is the only
 
04:00:00.720 --> 04:00:02.290 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care really is the only
uh

04:00:02.290 --> 04:00:02.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:04.729 --> 04:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
evidence-based approach
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
um towards looking at dysphoria and you
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
know that was their word not mine
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
underscore that word only and I found
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
that word a little bit problematic
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
especially in light of some of the later
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
testimony which said that in Europe
 
04:00:24.170 --> 04:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
certainly not within all of Europe but
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
we have we heard about Finland Sweden
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
Italy France England kind of pivoting
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
away from the Dutch protocol and looking
 
04:00:35.570 --> 04:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
more at
 
04:00:35.580 --> 04:00:37.030 align:start position:0%
more at
um

04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy up until the age 18 and
 
04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
going towards that so um so the question
 
04:00:45.410 --> 04:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
is what was driving that and I don't
 
04:00:48.769 --> 04:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
really think that in the hearings we
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
were able to get sufficient answer to
 
04:00:53.570 --> 04:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
that question you know was that being
 
04:00:55.969 --> 04:00:55.979 align:start position:0%
driven by politics was that being driven
 
04:00:58.610 --> 04:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
by actual you know evidentiary findings
 
04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we know but I think
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
um it may be worthwhile for this
 
04:01:07.490 --> 04:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that especially in
 
04:01:09.610 --> 04:01:09.620 align:start position:0%
light of the fact of the the the
 
04:01:11.769 --> 04:01:11.779 align:start position:0%
opponents of the bill
 
04:01:15.170 --> 04:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
continual reassertion of saying the the
 
04:01:17.450 --> 04:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is the only
 
04:01:19.610 --> 04:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
approach and sometimes I think when when
 
04:01:22.670 --> 04:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
you put that forward that can be a
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
little bit closed-minded and I think
 
04:01:26.450 --> 04:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to benefit by going
 
04:01:29.689 --> 04:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
through and understanding why did
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
certainly not all of Europe but some
 
04:01:33.650 --> 04:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
very important countries within Europe
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
decide to move away from what had been a
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
standard treatment towards Psychotherapy
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
so uh long and short of it I'd like to
 
04:01:44.689 --> 04:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
retain the bill and use this as a kind
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
of a guideline for what the floor should
 
04:01:49.370 --> 04:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
be and that's where I'm at thank you
 
04:01:50.809 --> 04:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
you're moving to retain
 
04:01:54.910 --> 04:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon put her hand up
 
04:01:57.359 --> 04:02:00.290 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon put her hand up
representative

04:02:00.290 --> 04:02:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:01.849 --> 04:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
you're moving this second thing okay
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
seeing uh yes representative Missouri
 
04:02:11.689 --> 04:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
yeah I concur with representative McLean
 
04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
after all of those hearings I proceeded
 
04:02:17.689 --> 04:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
to really dig into and do a lot of
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
research on what's coming out of Sweden
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
France UK Etc and have found some really
 
04:02:25.370 --> 04:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
interesting information in that of which
 
04:02:28.130 --> 04:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
I didn't know before so I would like
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
more time to dig into
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
um and also some stories of
 
04:02:36.889 --> 04:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
um adults who have gone through that
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
experience and and what physically
 
04:02:42.650 --> 04:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing today some of which
 
04:02:45.410 --> 04:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
we did here during the hearing so I I
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
would appreciate more time to to just
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
dig into a lot of this more
 
04:02:52.250 --> 04:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:54.530 --> 04:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
04:02:57.889 --> 04:02:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:02.689 --> 04:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
so so one testimonia
 
04:03:06.610 --> 04:03:06.620 align:start position:0%
against this bill included situation
 
04:03:11.330 --> 04:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
when a minor was coached by
 
04:03:16.849 --> 04:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
all the man who was I believe 42 and I
 
04:03:20.290 --> 04:03:20.300 align:start position:0%
was actually like Predator receiving
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
some sexual favors from that minor but
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
also being the only person
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
who was encouraging that minor in a
 
04:03:32.290 --> 04:03:32.300 align:start position:0%
journey of
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
being a person of a new gender and I see
 
04:03:41.530 --> 04:03:41.540 align:start position:0%
it situation as could be seen both ways
 
04:03:44.689 --> 04:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
as for this bill or but also
 
04:03:47.170 --> 04:03:47.180 align:start position:0%
against this bill
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
or vice versa so when we move with minus
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
and irreversible changes I think we need
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
to be a caution and I understand the
 
04:04:04.510 --> 04:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
argument that
 
04:04:07.610 --> 04:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Thoughts can also lead to
 
04:04:13.250 --> 04:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
irreversible circumstances but I I
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
I deny the premise that
 
04:04:16.920 --> 04:04:18.429 align:start position:0%
I deny the premise that
uh

04:04:18.429 --> 04:04:18.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:24.429 --> 04:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
sex change for a significant portion of
 
04:04:29.570 --> 04:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
our minus is a protrudent way to go and
 
04:04:33.650 --> 04:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
I I would support the bill as it is but
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
I respect about the representative
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
McLean presented to us that we need more
 
04:04:44.349 --> 04:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
data to understand uh if there are other
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
approaches scientifically based so thank
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Murphy
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
um it's amazing to me that after
 
04:04:59.929 --> 04:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
listening to Neely
 
04:05:04.610 --> 04:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
a hundred um testimonies 93 sorry
 
04:05:06.410 --> 04:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
um it's amazing to me that I would come
 
04:05:08.809 --> 04:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
away with any questions left I would
 
04:05:09.769 --> 04:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
have thought everything would have been
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
answered but I actually think I came
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
away with more questions than I had
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
answers to
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
um and as a result of that I called a
 
04:05:19.490 --> 04:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
physician an endocrinologist at
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth who has been running the
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
transgender program for the last four
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
decades and I spent an hour with them on
 
04:05:27.950 --> 04:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
the phone on on Friday trying to
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
understand questions I had about
 
04:05:34.010 --> 04:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
um the the the difficulties of The
 
04:05:36.969 --> 04:05:36.979 align:start position:0%
Adolescents through puberty and the
 
04:05:40.849 --> 04:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the um uh in how many
 
04:05:43.010 --> 04:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
how many patients that go through
 
04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
transition actually have regret buyers
 
04:05:46.969 --> 04:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
regret and he told me it was actually
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
very small maybe two to four percent
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
also trying to get an understanding and
 
04:05:53.090 --> 04:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
I asked actually the question
 
04:05:55.610 --> 04:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing of the physician
 
04:05:57.650 --> 04:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
who was a resident at Dartmouth
 
04:06:00.290 --> 04:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
um about the reversibility or not of
 
04:06:03.050 --> 04:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
some of the um the drugs and she did not
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
know but um uh Dr Turco actually
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned me that you know you can go
 
04:06:09.530 --> 04:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
through the um uh puberty halting drugs
 
04:06:11.809 --> 04:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
and that can be very much reversible uh
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
even with the hormones that they use
 
04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
later uh in their teenage years but no
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
transition surgery is done until well
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
into their adulthood So after talking to
 
04:06:22.510 --> 04:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
him and after
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
understanding with uh with Dr uh with um
 
04:06:27.710 --> 04:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
what representative McLean wants to put
 
04:06:27.720 --> 04:06:29.090 align:start position:0%
what representative McLean wants to put
forward

04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
um my sense would be that to retain this
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
to better understand for all of us to
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
better understand because honestly I
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
think all of us have a lot of questions
 
04:06:39.650 --> 04:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
and if we have more of these questions
 
04:06:41.150 --> 04:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
answered we can come up with a much
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
better bill in some shape or form so I
 
04:06:46.849 --> 04:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate the effort to put forward a a
 
04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
concept um going forward and I would
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
vote for retention as well thank you
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you when we say that uh no
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
significant side effects those puberty
 
04:06:58.800 --> 04:07:00.370 align:start position:0%
significant side effects those puberty
blockers

04:07:00.370 --> 04:07:00.380 align:start position:0%
blockers
 
04:07:04.370 --> 04:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
being prescribed off level so again to
 
04:07:06.170 --> 04:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
the discussion that there was no
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate testing for them thank you
 
04:07:13.130 --> 04:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
other representative Cushman thank you
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
um so I am going to support the retained
 
04:07:17.640 --> 04:07:18.830 align:start position:0%
um so I am going to support the retained
motion

04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I do think that the bill needs more
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
work I do think there are a lot of
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
concerns that are valid
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
um in society on both sides of this uh
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
generally I Am pro parents rights and I
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
think that there's probably some Middle
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
Ground here whether it's a waiting
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
period that needs to be had before
 
04:07:40.429 --> 04:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
anyone goes forward with certain
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
therapies or procedures or
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
um you know some other less heavy-handed
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
way of helping families navigate this
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
and make sure that
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
um the pros and cons are you know
 
04:07:53.220 --> 04:07:54.309 align:start position:0%
um the pros and cons are you know
weighed

04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
weighed
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh adequately
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
and that none of these you know just to
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
try to protect sometimes there's a
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
social phenomenon that can push people
 
04:08:06.290 --> 04:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
to make decisions hastily
 
04:08:09.889 --> 04:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
um I do I will support it um so that we
 
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
can work on it a little bit more
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
and uh that's all thank you
 
04:08:16.429 --> 04:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
clearly in the minority but I would much
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
I'm totally ready to vote itl on this um
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
but won't have the opportunity to I mean
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
I I view this
 
04:08:29.040 --> 04:08:32.389 align:start position:0%
I I view this
um

04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.050 --> 04:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
you know if this was my child and they
 
04:08:39.469 --> 04:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
were go or anybody I knew and they were
 
04:08:40.790 --> 04:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
um using hormone treatments or surgery
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
before 18 or after 18.
 
04:08:51.769 --> 04:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
um I would be very very concerned and
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
worried maybe freaked out
 
04:08:55.439 --> 04:08:56.510 align:start position:0%
worried maybe freaked out
um

04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
but as a parent
 
04:09:01.610 --> 04:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
if my child is under 18 I see it as my
 
04:09:03.889 --> 04:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
job to engage with them and come up with
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
a decision as a family if it's after 18
 
04:09:09.530 --> 04:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know I can have my say but it's
 
04:09:13.370 --> 04:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
really my job to accept my young adults
 
04:09:16.010 --> 04:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
decision and still
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
love them
 
04:09:22.189 --> 04:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
and so I see I view this very much as um
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
parents I wouldn't I probably wouldn't
 
04:09:27.290 --> 04:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
use the word term parents rights but
 
04:09:30.070 --> 04:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
family rights
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
and so I
 
04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be totally okay with
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
sending this bill away but
 
04:09:40.490 --> 04:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know in the spirit of consensus and
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of it's always good to
 
04:09:44.330 --> 04:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
learn more about something before we do
 
04:09:44.340 --> 04:09:45.469 align:start position:0%
learn more about something before we do
that

04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:47.689 --> 04:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
um I will vote to retain it thank you
 
04:09:49.969 --> 04:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
representative profile
 
04:09:53.330 --> 04:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I I also uh I will support a
 
04:09:58.070 --> 04:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
routine motion I I think there
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think the the
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in this bill that requires
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
work I share the concerns that
 
04:10:07.309 --> 04:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative McLean has has raised
 
04:10:10.189 --> 04:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I I think there's just we're we're
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
early enough in this that I think that
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
there the the long-term impact of some
 
04:10:17.450 --> 04:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
of these procedures on children is
 
04:10:17.460 --> 04:10:18.309 align:start position:0%
of these procedures on children is
really

04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh not well known
 
04:10:23.929 --> 04:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that we need to
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
understand if there are changes
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
happening elsewhere in the world why is
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
that and what is in the best interest of
 
04:10:32.689 --> 04:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
those children I also I just think there
 
04:10:34.370 --> 04:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
are some things in this bill that that
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
need work and I'll give you one example
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
is at the very end of the bill
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
um you know it says no insurer that
 
04:10:42.530 --> 04:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
issues or renews a policy for health
 
04:10:42.540 --> 04:10:44.269 align:start position:0%
issues or renews a policy for health
insurance

04:10:44.269 --> 04:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:10:44.279 --> 04:10:44.990 align:start position:0%
insurance
um

04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
et cetera Etc shall be required uh oh it
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
shall be required okay I I was uh I was
 
04:10:54.769 --> 04:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
reading it as a as a uh a mandate
 
04:10:57.590 --> 04:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
similar to the above so that's my my bad
 
04:10:59.450 --> 04:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
for uh for misreading that one
 
04:11:01.130 --> 04:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
nevertheless there there are other
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
examples throughout the bill that I
 
04:11:04.130 --> 04:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
think are just
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
um poorly conceived and really require
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
some work so I will be voting for the
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
motion to retain okay thank you
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon and then
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:15.840 --> 04:11:16.969 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:11:16.969 --> 04:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:19.450 --> 04:11:19.460 align:start position:0%
I would love to kill it as well however
 
04:11:21.410 --> 04:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
I did get
 
04:11:21.420 --> 04:11:23.269 align:start position:0%
I did get
um

04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
I did get a lot of questions in my mind
 
04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
as well based on some of the comments
 
04:11:29.689 --> 04:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
yes and um
 
04:11:32.570 --> 04:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to do some delving into that
 
04:11:32.580 --> 04:11:34.010 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to do some delving into that
myself

04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:11:34.020 --> 04:11:35.510 align:start position:0%
myself
uh

04:11:35.510 --> 04:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
I have had numerous I've worked with
 
04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
numerous parents and their kids over the
 
04:11:43.610 --> 04:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
past 20 years
 
04:11:46.729 --> 04:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
and and I know that they want to do the
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
right thing for their children as well
 
04:11:51.889 --> 04:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
and for us to just put something in
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
place without doing further
 
04:11:55.610 --> 04:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
investigation would be
 
04:11:55.620 --> 04:11:56.889 align:start position:0%
investigation would be
wrong

04:11:56.889 --> 04:11:56.899 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
so we need to do some additional work on
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
it I actually think what representative
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
McLean has done is as far as an
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
amendment goes closer to what I was even
 
04:12:13.250 --> 04:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
thinking about so I'm willing to work
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
with that and work with some people here
 
04:12:19.969 --> 04:12:19.979 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murphy thank
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
you once again I I too would um Echo
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's sentiment I too
 
04:12:32.210 --> 04:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
would be inclined on its surface at the
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
face surface to itls Bill no question in
 
04:12:36.530 --> 04:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
my mind however
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
I I hearken back to when representative
 
04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
Roy first
 
04:12:44.330 --> 04:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
stated that after you know last week
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
when he started out his comment was
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
important that he said I want to get the
 
04:12:51.170 --> 04:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
discussion going because it's not out
 
04:12:54.170 --> 04:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
there so if you come away from hearing
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
93 testimonies and you still have
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions and it forces you to call
 
04:13:02.929 --> 04:13:02.939 align:start position:0%
providers elsewhere it strikes me that
 
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
we all are lacking in a lot of the
 
04:13:06.769 --> 04:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
information that we could benefit from
 
04:13:10.250 --> 04:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
so if for for no other reason to retain
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
the bill and bring it back it's not to
 
04:13:14.150 --> 04:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
kick it down the road it's basically to
 
04:13:16.010 --> 04:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
bring it back so that we can inform
 
04:13:18.530 --> 04:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
ourselves because if we killed it today
 
04:13:21.050 --> 04:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
or pass it today in one way your shape
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
or form it's going to come back again in
 
04:13:25.370 --> 04:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
some other form it will come back so I
 
04:13:28.610 --> 04:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
think that by retaining it pairing it
 
04:13:32.450 --> 04:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
down as representative McLean did we can
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
then move forward to educate ourselves

board so yes I would rather on its
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
surface itl but I am more than happy to
 
04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%

it wasn't even my original

is that there's a lot of medical

tonight

04:31:17.330 --> 04:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
remember this could be start taking
 
04:31:19.370 --> 04:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
their seats
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%

okay we only have a couple bills left
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
um next one I would like to go to is a
 
04:31:34.490 --> 04:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
house bill 368 and I'll recognize
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
I moved to retain I'll spell 368. okay
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Leon seconds
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon do you want to
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes
 
04:31:49.680 --> 04:31:52.309 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes
um

04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
it was a struggle
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
for me to do this but it's a I think it
 
04:31:59.530 --> 04:31:59.540 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing for us to to
 
04:32:02.929 --> 04:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
discuss this a little more um I I find
 
04:32:05.050 --> 04:32:05.060 align:start position:0%
this this a benefit for our medical
 
04:32:08.689 --> 04:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
community to be able to have some
 
04:32:13.010 --> 04:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
protections from outside sources for
 
04:32:15.170 --> 04:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
sharing information about their patients
 
04:32:17.450 --> 04:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes down to legal
 
04:32:21.290 --> 04:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
matters outside the state so I think
 
04:32:21.300 --> 04:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
matters outside the state so I think
that

04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill is limited in Focus
 
04:32:28.010 --> 04:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
primarily to um
 
04:32:30.889 --> 04:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
our transgender Community but there may
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.370 --> 04:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
more people in a broader sense as far as
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
other issues that need the same
 
04:32:42.050 --> 04:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
protections and instead of just doing
 
04:32:42.060 --> 04:32:43.490 align:start position:0%
protections and instead of just doing
one

04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
small piece of the pie is to look at it
 
04:32:50.090 --> 04:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
on a little broader level and and I
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
think we could make it better and not
 
04:32:55.969 --> 04:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
just focusing on one Community but on a
 
04:32:58.610 --> 04:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
lot of the medical medical community and
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
the information that people have been
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
asking for outside the state especially
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to legal issues
 
04:33:07.131 --> 04:33:07.141 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:10.010 --> 04:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
of Representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for sharing that
 
04:33:16.490 --> 04:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
um I do think that there's a lot of
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings around HIPAA and
 
04:33:19.970 --> 04:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
exactly what privacy protections there
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
are we assume that there's some
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
protections that are in place there's
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
other ones where we don't understand
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
those implications and I do think that
 
04:33:29.689 --> 04:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
this brings up this is a clear
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
indication of where where bat we're
 
04:33:34.970 --> 04:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
pitting States against States and that
 
04:33:37.010 --> 04:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
there's a particular desire to have this
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
protection but better understanding
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
patient privacy and protecting people
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I think should be
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
a broader conversation and I think we
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
might be able to do something really
 
04:33:48.890 --> 04:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
phenomenal not just for our transgender
 
04:33:52.010 --> 04:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will ask Clark to call the
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
role a motion is to retain post bill
 
04:33:59.879 --> 04:34:02.150 align:start position:0%
role a motion is to retain post bill
368.

04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
368.

04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
okay and the final bill for our
 
04:35:14.631 --> 04:35:14.641 align:start position:0%
consideration today is House Bill 608
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
and I know we're waiting for an
 
04:35:16.859 --> 04:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
and I know we're waiting for an
amendment

04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:35:18.240 --> 04:35:19.310 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:22.189 --> 04:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative Shapiro Mr chairman
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
can I just make a general comment that's
 
04:35:25.369 --> 04:35:25.379 align:start position:0%
not related to
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's you know a specific Bill oh sure
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
I I just think um
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
you know this um
 
04:35:35.631 --> 04:35:35.641 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's comments about
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
HIPAA kind of make me think that we deal
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
with a lot of very kind of technical
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
policies that are really difficult for
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
people to understand who study it all
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
the time and we're not those people so I
 
04:35:53.929 --> 04:35:53.939 align:start position:0%
I'm just it makes me think I've often
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
thought this about Medicaid and now I'm
 
04:36:00.890 --> 04:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
thinking about HIPAA if um you know in
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
the future as time goes on if we could
 
04:36:05.869 --> 04:36:05.879 align:start position:0%
have some continuing education in our
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee on like those kind of specific
 
04:36:11.631 --> 04:36:11.641 align:start position:0%
topics because we have to we have to
 
04:36:14.631 --> 04:36:14.641 align:start position:0%
make decisions based on knowledge about
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
those things and to a large extent we
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
get experts to tell us but I think we
 
04:36:21.890 --> 04:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
could use some more general information
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
to generally understand those and I'm
 
04:36:26.929 --> 04:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
sure there are other topics as well it's
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
a good point and I I could follow up
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
with the Department if you want on that
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
when I was at the department we took a a
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
crash course on it like a webinar or
 
04:36:38.590 --> 04:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
something and it's an incredibly
 
04:36:44.090 --> 04:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
complicated uh massive thing but but any
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
insight we could gain would be that much
 
04:36:49.730 --> 04:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
you know that much further ahead for us
 
04:36:52.631 --> 04:36:52.641 align:start position:0%
good good point but yeah in fact
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative Williams
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe you could uh
 
04:37:00.051 --> 04:37:00.061 align:start position:0%
advise me on that we can talk later but
 
04:37:03.051 --> 04:37:03.061 align:start position:0%
uh about uh doing something like that so
 
04:37:06.410 --> 04:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber the joy of that is
 
04:37:10.609 --> 04:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
that you could also perhaps make it
 
04:37:12.529 --> 04:37:12.539 align:start position:0%
available to other members of the house
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
and and now that we have the recording
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
capability uh people who can't attend
 
04:37:20.689 --> 04:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to watch it online
 
04:37:24.230 --> 04:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
which is an incredible benefit not only
 
04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
to us but to our constituents as well
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:35.209 --> 04:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:37.250 --> 04:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments uh while we're
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
waiting for the amendment on House Bill
 
04:37:39.119 --> 04:37:40.730 align:start position:0%
waiting for the amendment on House Bill
608.

04:37:40.730 --> 04:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
608.
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
04:37:46.490 --> 04:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
chairman um on my way off to lunch I
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
made the fortune or mistake of walking
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
past the finance committee um division
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
three and they were looking at some of
 
04:37:55.730 --> 04:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
the sections of the budget that did not
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually have any fiscal impacts um
 
04:38:00.170 --> 04:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
division one had sent some of those on
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
for consideration to the policy
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how it happens but
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're interested in our insights on um
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the part the sections 282 283 and
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
284 on receiving facilities so basically
 
04:38:19.849 --> 04:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
those around the essentially the Mental
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
Health crisis receiving facilities and
 
04:38:24.470 --> 04:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
how to deal with those so we'll find out
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
more how we're going to do that but if
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
we can take a look at that part of the
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
budget and see what Insight we can
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
provide while they're playing with the
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
numbers we try and figure out what we
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
need to do to protect our people
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know representative Weber
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
I was going to suggest that while we're
 
04:38:44.209 --> 04:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
waiting for an official Amendment
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative Leon can tell us
 
04:38:49.810 --> 04:38:49.820 align:start position:0%
what the amendment contains
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
because I am currently
 
04:38:54.959 --> 04:38:58.670 align:start position:0%
because I am currently
without

04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.970 --> 04:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
direction as I mean I I would very much
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
like knowing what I know now to retain
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608
 
04:39:06.959 --> 04:39:07.609 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608
um

04:39:07.609 --> 04:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:10.609 --> 04:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
but oh well we may have it right in
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
04:39:14.929 --> 04:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm willing to entertain any any
 
04:39:16.609 --> 04:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
kind of other suggestions and I think
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
we've gone a long way by
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
listening to each other and and
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
throwing out different ideas but
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
um as long as they're here I'll stop
 
04:39:35.209 --> 04:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to open the executive
 
04:39:40.250 --> 04:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
session on 608
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
anyway as the amendment goes around let
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
us officially open the
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
open I Can Begin our consideration of
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608 representative Leon thank
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
you um I guess to make this official
 
04:39:56.770 --> 04:39:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.410 --> 04:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
2023-0954h to House Bill 608
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.750 --> 04:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is just for discussion purposes
 
04:40:10.970 --> 04:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
we're not voting it representative
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
Cushman seconds representative Leon
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you very much this is um an
 
04:40:20.090 --> 04:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
amendment that um was crafted with help
 
04:40:22.250 --> 04:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the department
 
04:40:23.770 --> 04:40:23.780 align:start position:0%
um this
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
I put a lot of work working with the
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
Department in order to figure out what a
 
04:40:29.410 --> 04:40:29.420 align:start position:0%
successful pilot program would look like
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
it has a six-month pilot program it has
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 10 agencies providing
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
Direct Services for geographic
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
representation and as it moves through
 
04:40:41.630 --> 04:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
this is one where it's providing status
 
04:40:43.070 --> 04:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
reports to Health and Human Services
 
04:40:45.890 --> 04:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and Reporting in
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
with them to make sure that everybody's
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
voices are heard within the process and
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
it requires the department to seek any
 
04:40:55.150 --> 04:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
waivers to implement this pilot from CMS
 
04:40:57.288 --> 04:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
and if they're not able to get those
 
04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
waivers that they'll need to go to
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services for
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
um for approval
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
so there is also a phased implement it
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
speaks to a phased implementation plan
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
to print permits system modifications is
 
04:41:12.410 --> 04:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
needed to best support the individuals
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
and families through the transition to
 
04:41:17.690 --> 04:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
nearest Services rates Technologies and
 
04:41:19.730 --> 04:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
so this um
 
04:41:22.490 --> 04:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
it also delays the full implementation
 
04:41:24.770 --> 04:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
without a pilot to no sooner than
 
04:41:28.250 --> 04:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 to allow it to be
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
aligned with the individual support plan
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
dates and not get in the way of the
 
04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
person-centered planning
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
um one part that I wanted to add to this
 
04:41:37.610 --> 04:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
as well would have been a requirement
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the Department to seek waivers to
 
04:41:45.770 --> 04:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
the continued access the the cap to make
 
04:41:49.070 --> 04:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure that we seek the waivers for direct
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
billing and we seek the waivers around
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management especially
 
04:41:56.448 --> 04:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
making use of the only willing and only
 
04:41:58.490 --> 04:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
willing and available I forget the
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
specific language
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
and to check in with over Health and
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight to make sure
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
that not only are
 
04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
people speaking from the community but
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
that oversight is able to recognize that
 
04:42:15.050 --> 04:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
there is that that either their their
 
04:42:16.730 --> 04:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
concerns are being heard even if they're
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
not acted on and to serve as
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
representatives for the communities that
 
04:42:23.570 --> 04:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
are impacted
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
um that part I I tried to figure out how
 
04:42:27.170 --> 04:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
to get that language to charge the
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
department to do that and to hopefully
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do that through this
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
process I do know that with the bill
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
that we we passed before on emerging
 
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies last year when we
 
04:42:40.128 --> 04:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
had Catherine Rogers bill instead of
 
04:42:42.170 --> 04:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
passing it we moved it to oversight
 
04:42:44.208 --> 04:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
where it became the responsibility of
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
oversight and I'm not sure the exact
 
04:42:49.128 --> 04:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do so but I would hope that
 
04:42:53.090 --> 04:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
we can ask oversight to pursue with the
 
04:42:55.250 --> 04:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
Department these waivers to provide all
 
04:42:58.368 --> 04:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
of that encouragement and emphasis that
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
might be needed to CMS in order to
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
increase the odds of success of those
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
waivers and to also not look to
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
implement it on the last day of a
 
04:43:09.170 --> 04:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
two-year waiver but to try and get it as
 
04:43:11.208 --> 04:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
going as soon as possible so that
 
04:43:12.650 --> 04:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
there's still time on the clock to deal
 
04:43:14.448 --> 04:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
with any challenges as they come about
 
04:43:16.490 --> 04:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be a two-year delay it
 
04:43:17.690 --> 04:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
should just be a little breathing room
 
04:43:19.970 --> 04:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
to get this done the right way in the
 
04:43:21.530 --> 04:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and and so with this this would keep
 
04:43:25.250 --> 04:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
this moving forward in order to have a
 
04:43:26.650 --> 04:43:26.660 align:start position:0%
pilot plan
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
based off the recommendations from the a
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
m report this this does have support
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
this has been passed around this this
 
04:43:37.010 --> 04:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
language had come to us it had come
 
04:43:39.530 --> 04:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
around before and it had also gone to
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
some of the stakeholders and while there
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
were different points of concern it it
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
had General acceptance on this this
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
isn't a perfect solution but this is
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
going to help us find a better
 
04:43:53.208 --> 04:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
implementation and so I really ask that
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
you support this so that we can move
 
04:43:56.930 --> 04:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
this forward and move this process so
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
that it continue its path over in the
 
04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
Senate even if it does adapt on that
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
side and we figure out how best to help
 
04:44:06.288 --> 04:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental services do
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
this redesign in a way where people are
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
respected heard and acknowledged in a
 
04:44:13.690 --> 04:44:13.700 align:start position:0%
way that they hear
 
04:44:16.490 --> 04:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
other representative Palmer
 
04:44:18.890 --> 04:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
so I I just have a question looking at
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh sex section eight
 
04:44:24.890 --> 04:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and it the my question is around this
 
04:44:26.810 --> 04:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
that I understood there are sort of two
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
parts to this one is the absolute
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
required parts of the direct billing and
 
04:44:31.378 --> 04:44:32.150 align:start position:0%
required parts of the direct billing and
cut

04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
cut
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
um conflict of interesting which was
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to start we're supposed to
 
04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
start on July 1st and then the other
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of the pie which came through the
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
a m report and this sort of seems to say
 
04:44:46.610 --> 04:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
that you know if CMS doesn't authorize
 
04:44:50.690 --> 04:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
the pilot but that are you I'm just I
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little confused uh if I can
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
answer that sure the whole process is
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
very confusing the pilot program itself
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
and some of the implementations where it
 
04:45:02.288 --> 04:45:02.298 align:start position:0%
would require different waivers from CMS
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
waivers seem to be one of the ways that
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
they operate that these are the rules
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
and then this is how we accommodate all
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
the different states and
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
um you know that might be a bit of a
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization but as I was
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing a lot of information from
 
04:45:15.770 --> 04:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
different states and different
 
04:45:18.170 --> 04:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
presentations CMS provided to the states
 
04:45:20.930 --> 04:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
it basically laid out that here's our
 
04:45:22.310 --> 04:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
path and here's our waivers that
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
accommodate you and so that would be a
 
04:45:27.288 --> 04:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
practice because if we require them to
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
have waivers but then CMS didn't improve
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
them if we didn't have this language in
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
here to give them another option they'd
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
either be in conflict with with Federal
 
04:45:39.410 --> 04:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
Regulations or state law if they were
 
04:45:41.510 --> 04:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
unable to do it without without an
 
04:45:45.288 --> 04:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
approved waiver so may I follow up so
 
04:45:45.298 --> 04:45:48.410 align:start position:0%
approved waiver so may I follow up so
if

04:45:48.410 --> 04:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
if basically CMS doesn't give a waiver
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
and the and the um agency has to start
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
the the finance piece and the conflict
 
04:46:00.530 --> 04:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
of interest peace on July 1st
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
the pilot program still can go forward
 
04:46:02.520 --> 04:46:04.128 align:start position:0%
the pilot program still can go forward
later

04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:46:06.288 --> 04:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
the pilot program that's been within
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
this actually doesn't touch on those
 
04:46:11.930 --> 04:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
parts on the direct billing uh the
 
04:46:13.970 --> 04:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
direct billing compliance or the
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
conflict of it conflict-free case
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
management representative Weber then
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
representative McLean
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay so this is really a lot to digest
 
04:46:27.610 --> 04:46:27.620 align:start position:0%
at the last minute and
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
I am very concerned that we are
 
04:46:32.690 --> 04:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
digesting it at the last minute with no
 
04:46:34.550 --> 04:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the room and I don't
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
know what kind of I mean this is
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
something that should have gone through
 
04:46:40.788 --> 04:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
a robust subcommittee process and didn't
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I understand that we had time frames
 
04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
and and all of that but I'm I'm
 
04:46:48.530 --> 04:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about that uh because in
 
04:46:50.510 --> 04:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
trying to solve the problem I'm not at
 
04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
all convinced that we're going to solve
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
anything rather than create more
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
problems for people
 
04:46:57.840 --> 04:46:59.448 align:start position:0%
problems for people
um so

04:46:59.448 --> 04:46:59.458 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:47:03.890 --> 04:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
I have several questions if I may uh the
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
first is that this seems to be codifying
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
into statute the a m report and the
 
04:47:15.530 --> 04:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the a m report and
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
what I heard from a lot of people
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
sitting out there at the hearing
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
that we had was that they very much
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the a m report and were
 
04:47:30.430 --> 04:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
very concerned about its implementation
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I would be very
 
04:47:36.550 --> 04:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about doing without more input
 
04:47:36.560 --> 04:47:38.470 align:start position:0%
concerned about doing without more input
is

04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
codifying that report into statute so
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
that's item number one
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then the second thing that I I think
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
I heard you say that this would request
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
would require people to seek waivers for
 
04:47:59.330 --> 04:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
the conflict stuff which is the stuff
 
04:48:01.368 --> 04:48:01.378 align:start position:0%
that we're really bumping up against in
 
04:48:03.410 --> 04:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
terms of deadlines and I don't see
 
04:48:06.670 --> 04:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
anything in here that requires that
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
it just says shall seek waivers to
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
implement the pilot and I don't think
 
04:48:15.890 --> 04:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
that's the same waiver because the
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
conflict is not the pilot program the
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
conflict is what people need to get done
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
before then
 
04:48:24.288 --> 04:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:48:26.330 --> 04:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
I may have heard you wrong because I was
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
trying to read and listen at the same
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
time but
 
04:48:31.690 --> 04:48:31.700 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
this is a requirement of seeking a
 
04:48:37.490 --> 04:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
waiver on the conflict which I think
 
04:48:39.948 --> 04:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to do because I'm
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
hearing from a lot of people that
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're really worried about that
 
04:48:46.730 --> 04:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't think this language does that
 
04:48:49.970 --> 04:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
so those are my two concerns and uh
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
initial concerns but I've got more than
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
that in that
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
the community isn't here for us the
 
04:48:58.250 --> 04:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholders aren't here for us to hear
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
from them
 
04:49:01.610 --> 04:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
and I would like to hear from the
 
04:49:03.288 --> 04:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
Department if the Department's willing
 
04:49:05.810 --> 04:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
to give us an opinion
 
04:49:09.050 --> 04:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you as to the
 
04:49:11.208 --> 04:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
part about seeking waivers for the July
 
04:49:12.890 --> 04:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
1st you're correct that those are not in
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
here my question was how we can direct a
 
04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
process through oversight like we did
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
with the Katherine Rogers biomarkers
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill last year when that was sent to
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
oversight to deal with it as a
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as opposed to doing this is
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
that something that this committee would
 
04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
need to take action on or would
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
oversight be able to do so on its own
 
04:49:32.930 --> 04:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weber well that one
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
oversight can do it on their own uh I
 
04:49:37.610 --> 04:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
think somebody from this committee ought
 
04:49:40.970 --> 04:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
to go and ask them to do it and and
 
04:49:40.980 --> 04:49:44.030 align:start position:0%
to go and ask them to do it and and
their

04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be a request of the
 
04:49:49.010 --> 04:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
committee then the committee as a whole
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
has to come to some kind of consensus
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that they can they are
 
04:49:58.250 --> 04:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
Allowed by Statute to appoint any
 
04:50:01.150 --> 04:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees they want to appoint and
 
04:50:04.628 --> 04:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
so it could be as simple as a matter of
 
04:50:07.310 --> 04:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
several of us going and saying look
 
04:50:08.810 --> 04:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
these are the things we want to deal
 
04:50:08.820 --> 04:50:09.650 align:start position:0%
these are the things we want to deal
with

04:50:09.650 --> 04:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
I would be much more comfortable
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill and referring
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
issues to the oversight committee now
 
04:50:20.448 --> 04:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
if we pass this it has the force of Law
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and people have to do it the oversight
 
04:50:27.050 --> 04:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
committee makes recommendations and
 
04:50:28.730 --> 04:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes one of the recommendations is
 
04:50:30.430 --> 04:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
we ought to pass a law
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
but they cannot mandate
 
04:50:37.010 --> 04:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
the department do anything they can
 
04:50:40.030 --> 04:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
suggest they can congole they can
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
poke but but they can't
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually mandate anything so I mean if
 
04:50:49.490 --> 04:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
if there's something we want to mandate
 
04:50:52.250 --> 04:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
it has to be in statute but I'm really
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about this language going into
 
04:50:54.240 --> 04:50:55.330 align:start position:0%
concerned about this language going into
statute

04:50:55.330 --> 04:50:55.340 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
if it's a matter of a less formal
 
04:51:01.610 --> 04:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
appearance before the oversight
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee then I'm I'm happier about
 
04:51:03.600 --> 04:51:04.730 align:start position:0%
committee then I'm I'm happier about
that

04:51:04.730 --> 04:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:04.740 --> 04:51:05.948 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:51:05.948 --> 04:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:14.448 --> 04:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
the one concern that I I have I mean I
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
think I think we really do share most of
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
the same concerns uh the concern I share
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
with you is uh we do need to make sure
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
that things are progressing along and uh
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether that's
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
I mean that that would be best done in a
 
04:51:33.890 --> 04:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
statute if we were all agreed as to how
 
04:51:35.448 --> 04:51:35.458 align:start position:0%
to draft the statute and what goes in
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
I think the second best thing because we
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
don't have that would be to retain the
 
04:51:48.958 --> 04:51:49.788 align:start position:0%
don't have that would be to retain the
bill

04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:51:53.570 --> 04:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
the department can still proceed and we
 
04:51:56.090 --> 04:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
I think it's pretty clear from what
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
we've heard that they're not
 
04:52:01.610 --> 04:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
going to proceed with the a m part of
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
the implementation until after they've
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
solved the Brazilian questions that
 
04:52:08.990 --> 04:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
they've got about the conflict of
 
04:52:10.330 --> 04:52:10.340 align:start position:0%
interest stuff
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh so I feel less anxious about kicking
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
the can down the road
 
04:52:19.368 --> 04:52:19.378 align:start position:0%
um but I would feel a lot more
 
04:52:21.890 --> 04:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
comfortable I think if what we did was
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
retain the bill work on this language
 
04:52:28.610 --> 04:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
and then have have oversight
 
04:52:30.350 --> 04:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
04:52:31.970 --> 04:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
you know what one of the things they can
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
certainly do regularly is ask for
 
04:52:35.570 --> 04:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
updates on this every single month when
 
04:52:36.730 --> 04:52:36.740 align:start position:0%
they meet
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
and perhaps have a subcommittee to delve
 
04:52:41.448 --> 04:52:41.458 align:start position:0%
into it further
 
04:52:43.970 --> 04:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
but I think that this is something that
 
04:52:46.970 --> 04:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
the legislative action ought to be taken
 
04:52:49.610 --> 04:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
with more input from stakeholders and
 
04:52:53.170 --> 04:52:53.180 align:start position:0%
and and really carefully drafted
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
because the last thing we want to do is
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
put more roadblocks in the way of a
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
population that's already and I know
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
that that's not the intent but but it's
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
my concern that we might get there
 
04:53:04.920 --> 04:53:07.190 align:start position:0%
my concern that we might get there
representative

04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
well I'm not going to sound as learned
 
04:53:11.090 --> 04:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
and astute as my colleague
 
04:53:14.390 --> 04:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Weber but my memory of
 
04:53:16.730 --> 04:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
when the stakeholders were here that
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
given a choice between retaining this
 
04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
bill or retaining them being able to
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
move their budgets around to pay for
 
04:53:24.718 --> 04:53:25.628 align:start position:0%
move their budgets around to pay for
things

04:53:25.628 --> 04:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:53:30.050 --> 04:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
their choice was that the being able to
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
manipulate their budgets efficiently was
 
04:53:35.690 --> 04:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
the one they wanted us to pass and this
 
04:53:37.610 --> 04:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
was the one that they were okay with us
 
04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
retaining so others of you that remember
 
04:53:41.218 --> 04:53:42.530 align:start position:0%
retaining so others of you that remember
that

04:53:42.530 --> 04:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that's good input and could
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
I make a call clarification none of that
 
04:53:50.330 --> 04:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
was learned that was me saying this is
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
all the stuff I don't know
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
just in case you missed that McLean and
 
04:53:57.230 --> 04:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
then representative Shapiro
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I
 
04:54:02.090 --> 04:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
I do have similar concerns I think just
 
04:54:04.610 --> 04:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
looking at this the way it's going
 
04:54:07.490 --> 04:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
forward it looks like the AL the a m
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
thing is going to be come because you're
 
04:54:13.490 --> 04:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
expanding the pilot from just two area
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
agencies basically to all 10 area
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
agencies it looks like this is going to
 
04:54:22.010 --> 04:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
be more of an implementation than and
 
04:54:23.930 --> 04:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
then an evaluation because the original
 
04:54:25.850 --> 04:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
one had been just hey we're going to try
 
04:54:28.010 --> 04:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
this out on two area agencies as an
 
04:54:30.288 --> 04:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
evaluation this expands it out to all
 
04:54:32.990 --> 04:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
ten so it does kind of have the feeling
 
04:54:36.530 --> 04:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
of this is more of an implementation
 
04:54:39.530 --> 04:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and where there was a lot of is the
 
04:54:41.810 --> 04:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
two-tier approach really the way to go
 
04:54:44.750 --> 04:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of pushback on that and
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
then I share representative Weber's
 
04:54:48.530 --> 04:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
concerned we heard the testimony here
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
that they really want to have the the
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
stick on the the July 1st and so what I
 
04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
kind of walked away from is we're going
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
to go on July 1st and
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't work well we're gonna do
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
our best to make people whole because
 
04:55:06.170 --> 04:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's what we do and is CMS okay with
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
that ah so I don't know what there is in
 
04:55:13.610 --> 04:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
here to really push them to pursue the
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
waiver and I'm not as familiar with the
 
04:55:17.570 --> 04:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
oversight process having never touched
 
04:55:20.448 --> 04:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
it in my entire life so um but it's
 
04:55:22.250 --> 04:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
totally gone from here so I think those
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
are my concerns at this point
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
04:55:29.230 --> 04:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
yes I hope not to just repeat
 
04:55:31.970 --> 04:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative McLean but you know when
 
04:55:34.368 --> 04:55:34.378 align:start position:0%
I think of a pilot program I think of
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
small time limited short time limited
 
04:55:41.810 --> 04:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
and when I read this it seems to have so
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
many aspects and all 10 area agencies so
 
04:55:48.650 --> 04:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'm just reading maybe I'm just
 
04:55:51.410 --> 04:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
reading it wrong but um I'm having
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
trouble Discerning why this
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
you know the difference between
 
04:55:58.850 --> 04:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
implementation and a you know a pilot
 
04:56:01.250 --> 04:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
program to actually learn something
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you well just
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
as one point it's not 10 area agencies
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's 10 agencies that provide Direct
 
04:56:10.190 --> 04:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
Services so those that contract with
 
04:56:13.610 --> 04:56:13.620 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you I didn't understand
 
04:56:17.330 --> 04:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay so actually representative Leon um
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I think um my biggest concern
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
is making sure that this process has
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
oversight so I don't know if the correct
 
04:56:29.330 --> 04:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
way to do that would be to withdraw this
 
04:56:29.340 --> 04:56:30.890 align:start position:0%
way to do that would be to withdraw this
amendment

04:56:30.890 --> 04:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:56:34.368 --> 04:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
um have a formal motion or formal
 
04:56:35.750 --> 04:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
statement from this committee about
 
04:56:37.670 --> 04:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
04:56:40.368 --> 04:56:40.378 align:start position:0%
taking this on so that they can make
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
sure that the stakeholders are heard and
 
04:56:44.448 --> 04:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
then retaining this bill I don't know
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
how we would proceed with that
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
specifically and I'd seek advice on how
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
to make that happen but I think that
 
04:56:52.250 --> 04:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
would satisfy what we're trying to do
 
04:56:54.890 --> 04:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
especially if that statement says you
 
04:56:57.650 --> 04:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
know with the understanding that the a m
 
04:57:00.288 --> 04:57:00.298 align:start position:0%
that that there won't be adoption of the
 
04:57:03.288 --> 04:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
a m until we've addressed until we've
 
04:57:05.810 --> 04:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
addressed the issues with the federal
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
compliance on Direct payment and
 
04:57:10.250 --> 04:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case resolution that would
 
04:57:13.010 --> 04:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
not be advancing further on the a m and
 
04:57:14.750 --> 04:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
to work with open and for oversight to
 
04:57:18.530 --> 04:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:57:22.128 --> 04:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
as I understand it and I'm going to wait
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
for a researcher because she may have
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
been offering useful advice but if we
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
want to mandate that something happens
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
after something else then we have to
 
04:57:34.128 --> 04:57:34.138 align:start position:0%
pass a statute that says that that's the
 
04:57:36.050 --> 04:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
only way we can do that
 
04:57:40.368 --> 04:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
uh but we can certainly and and what I
 
04:57:43.250 --> 04:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
heard was people aren't ready to
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
implement that yet in any case
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh and what I further heard was that
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the staff they have now they're
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to be working double time for some
 
04:58:01.368 --> 04:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
time after July 1st just to deal with
 
04:58:05.288 --> 04:58:05.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
what we can do is we can ask our chair
 
04:58:11.628 --> 04:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
who serves on the Health and Human
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee supported
 
04:58:16.310 --> 04:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
by the other members of this committee
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
who are either serving members or
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
alternates on the committee to put this
 
04:58:24.410 --> 04:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
forward at our next meeting
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
um March 24th all right and
 
04:58:27.718 --> 04:58:28.250 align:start position:0%
um March 24th all right and
um

04:58:28.250 --> 04:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
we have always had enormous cooperation
 
04:58:32.690 --> 04:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
from the chair
 
04:58:34.250 --> 04:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
of that committee
 
04:58:38.810 --> 04:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
in this thing and I know I'm pretty sure
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
because I I've talked to him or I
 
04:58:42.410 --> 04:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to him and I think he
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
already has
 
04:58:47.690 --> 04:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
ongoing reports about this issue as
 
04:58:49.628 --> 04:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
something that he wants to hear from
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
just to explain a little bit about the
 
04:58:53.448 --> 04:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee it's a it's a joint committee
 
04:58:57.310 --> 04:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
it's senators and representatives
 
04:59:01.128 --> 04:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
generally it doesn't do much what it
 
04:59:03.230 --> 04:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
does is here
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
all of these reports that we mandate
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
that come around once a year once a
 
04:59:10.010 --> 04:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
quarter sometimes once a month when
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're when we were implementing the
 
04:59:14.570 --> 04:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
doorways project we got a report every
 
04:59:17.570 --> 04:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
month on the implementation so at a
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
minimum somebody from Health and Human
 
04:59:22.128 --> 04:59:22.138 align:start position:0%
Services who knows who is intimately
 
04:59:24.288 --> 04:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
involved with that
 
04:59:24.298 --> 04:59:24.890 align:start position:0%
involved with that
um

04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:27.770 --> 04:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
has to come and explain what's happened
 
04:59:30.050 --> 04:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
over the course of the month so
 
04:59:32.690 --> 04:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
you hear the updates and you get to ask
 
04:59:34.910 --> 04:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
the questions about all the things that
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
your constituents have asked you about
 
04:59:38.090 --> 04:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
and other legislators have asked you
 
04:59:38.100 --> 04:59:39.070 align:start position:0%
and other legislators have asked you
about

04:59:39.070 --> 04:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
the other thing to her great credit is
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
our current
 
04:59:47.208 --> 04:59:47.218 align:start position:0%
I believe it's acting commissioner comes
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
every month and is there at the
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
beginning of the meeting so she's there
 
04:59:52.970 --> 04:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
to be asked anything
 
04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
but I think that there's certainly a
 
04:59:59.448 --> 04:59:59.458 align:start position:0%
great deal of bipartisan concern about
 
05:00:02.570 --> 05:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
this issue and I think it's something
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
that we can get
 
05:00:06.708 --> 05:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services oversight
 
05:00:08.930 --> 05:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
to take up either as a committee or as a
 
05:00:11.510 --> 05:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for a subcommittee you have
 
05:00:14.330 --> 05:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
to present a plan of what the
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is and what the
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is going to do so that's a
 
05:00:19.550 --> 05:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
little more formal
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh but again it's just filing a written
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
submission so that they can
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
take into account what the subcommittee
 
05:00:31.010 --> 05:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
is going to do and I think for this
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
where there may be extra work that that
 
05:00:35.810 --> 05:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
really might be the way to go and the
 
05:00:37.970 --> 05:00:37.980 align:start position:0%
only limit on subcommittees for the
 
05:00:39.530 --> 05:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
05:00:42.110 --> 05:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
committee is the subcommittee has to be
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
chaired by one of the members of the
 
05:00:47.410 --> 05:00:47.420 align:start position:0%
oversight committee but they can pull in
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
either other legislative members or
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
other non-legislative members if that's
 
05:00:54.410 --> 05:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful and we've done that
 
05:00:56.830 --> 05:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
for various special projects in the past
 
05:00:59.868 --> 05:00:59.878 align:start position:0%
so it's a very flexible
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
thing but it it doesn't have the power
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
to mandate because it's not
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's a legislative oversight body it's
 
05:01:09.890 --> 05:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
not the body that does the legislation
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I guess my my concern would be given
 
05:01:15.050 --> 05:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
the given the time frame that we're
 
05:01:17.330 --> 05:01:17.340 align:start position:0%
operating under if we retain this bill
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
and find that we need something to be
 
05:01:22.128 --> 05:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
done we can certainly do it in January
 
05:01:25.250 --> 05:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
and if it's exigent enough we could and
 
05:01:27.288 --> 05:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
we have the
 
05:01:29.090 --> 05:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
consent of the Senate and the governor
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:33.770 --> 05:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
um from what I understand from our
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
researcher this was I spill a similar
 
05:01:39.110 --> 05:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill was ideal of last time and sent to
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
oversight do you know what happened with
 
05:01:43.610 --> 05:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
it at Alpha site
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
I was not a member of oversight last
 
05:01:47.448 --> 05:01:47.458 align:start position:0%
term yesterday
 
05:01:49.550 --> 05:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not understanding maybe it hasn't
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
been determined yet but I'm not
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
understanding what we're asking the
 
05:02:01.010 --> 05:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
05:02:04.128 --> 05:02:04.138 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with are we just
 
05:02:07.730 --> 05:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
asking them to keep track of the changes
 
05:02:09.830 --> 05:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
that have to happen by July 1 or are we
 
05:02:13.550 --> 05:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
asking them to actually Implement a
 
05:02:17.690 --> 05:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
um a pilot program or can DHHS Implement
 
05:02:20.330 --> 05:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
a pilot program on their own and then
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
the then the oversight committee would
 
05:02:25.368 --> 05:02:25.378 align:start position:0%
keep track of it I'm not really clear
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we're asking them to do if
 
05:02:29.090 --> 05:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at represent representative
 
05:02:33.410 --> 05:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
Williams at attorney Williams in the
 
05:02:35.330 --> 05:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
back who's occasionally nodding and
 
05:02:36.650 --> 05:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
occasionally shaking his head and
 
05:02:36.660 --> 05:02:38.150 align:start position:0%
occasionally shaking his head and
smiling

05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
smiling
 
05:02:38.160 --> 05:02:38.990 align:start position:0%
smiling
um

05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
and he may be able to help me with what
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
was referred to the committee last time
 
05:02:44.208 --> 05:02:44.218 align:start position:0%
because he does come to the committee
 
05:02:47.448 --> 05:02:47.458 align:start position:0%
meetings or sets them up and it may be
 
05:02:49.730 --> 05:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's okay I don't think we need to
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
do a great deal on that uh they can't
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
set up stuff or mandate anything uh they
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
can advise they can ask for information
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
they can suggest they can nudge about
 
05:03:04.128 --> 05:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
what anything that has to do with the
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
Department of healthy and well there are
 
05:03:08.690 --> 05:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
two things here what I'm trying to get
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
at is
 
05:03:13.490 --> 05:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
one of the things you suggested is will
 
05:03:16.010 --> 05:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
they implement this program and they
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
have no authority to implement anything
 
05:03:20.810 --> 05:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I want that to be clear
 
05:03:25.970 --> 05:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
so my first point is if you want to
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
implement or mandate something you have
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
to put it in statute only we're not
 
05:03:33.770 --> 05:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
clear enough on what we're implementing
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
or mandating yet for me to be willing to
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
agree to it
 
05:03:37.920 --> 05:03:39.070 align:start position:0%
agree to it
um

05:03:39.070 --> 05:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
what they can do is they can certainly
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
ask people to come and Report every
 
05:03:47.330 --> 05:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
month as to what is happening so first
 
05:03:49.128 --> 05:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
of all you just have eyes on the process
 
05:03:52.430 --> 05:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
which I think is incredibly useful the
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
other thing is that just by virtue of
 
05:03:57.170 --> 05:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
the fact that a number of different
 
05:03:59.690 --> 05:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
people from HHS have to come and sit in
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
the room at the same time and listen to
 
05:04:01.378 --> 05:04:02.868 align:start position:0%
the room at the same time and listen to
legislators

05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
they often find non-legislative
 
05:04:08.270 --> 05:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
solutions to all kinds of stuff that
 
05:04:11.090 --> 05:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't need legislative Solutions
 
05:04:14.930 --> 05:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
with respect to a pilot project and I
 
05:04:16.970 --> 05:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
think Mr Williams will correct me if I'm
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
wrong about this I hope he will
 
05:04:19.920 --> 05:04:21.110 align:start position:0%
wrong about this I hope he will
um

05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
the department can already do that and
 
05:04:26.750 --> 05:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
he's going like this so I'm pretty sure
 
05:04:28.850 --> 05:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
I'm on Solid Ground
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
our Our concern is we want to make sure
 
05:04:35.330 --> 05:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
they are doing that and that's one of
 
05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
the things that Health and Human
 
05:04:39.288 --> 05:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
Services oversights fairly good at doing
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
is focusing people's minds month by
 
05:04:45.770 --> 05:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
month on okay it's another month where
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
are we now and just knowing just knowing
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
that you have that deadline is often
 
05:04:53.448 --> 05:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
those of us who work better under
 
05:04:56.990 --> 05:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
deadlines I'm I'm I'm motivated by an
 
05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
approaching deadline to get certain
 
05:05:00.310 --> 05:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
things done
 
05:05:00.320 --> 05:05:02.150 align:start position:0%
things done
but

05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:05:02.160 --> 05:05:05.708 align:start position:0%
but
I'm

05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
we don't need to have
 
05:05:13.628 --> 05:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
a hugely well articulated
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
mission unless we want a specific
 
05:05:16.798 --> 05:05:18.590 align:start position:0%
mission unless we want a specific
subcommittee

05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
05:05:22.510 --> 05:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
to do a specific thing
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and I think maybe we could discuss
 
05:05:30.050 --> 05:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
that informally a bit more before
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
um before the 24th
 
05:05:33.000 --> 05:05:33.590 align:start position:0%
um before the 24th
um

05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:37.010 --> 05:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
or we could just as a as as Health and
 
05:05:39.170 --> 05:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight ask for
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
progress reports on this particular
 
05:05:41.160 --> 05:05:42.250 align:start position:0%
progress reports on this particular
issue

05:05:42.250 --> 05:05:42.260 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
and I he who keeps the agenda keeps
 
05:05:48.530 --> 05:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
nodding his head when I say this you
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
know I can't speak for representative
 
05:05:51.890 --> 05:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
Pearson because he's the chair of the
 
05:05:54.770 --> 05:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee but we have several members of
 
05:05:57.708 --> 05:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
the committee here and and
 
05:05:57.718 --> 05:05:58.490 align:start position:0%
the committee here and and
um

05:05:58.490 --> 05:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:02.570 --> 05:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
I I don't see a lot of controversy and I
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
think I think the issue is we want to
 
05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that things are being pushed
 
05:06:09.050 --> 05:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
along and the question that we all have
 
05:06:11.570 --> 05:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
is how best to do that I did
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
misunderstand earlier it was other
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that was itl them sent over
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
there it wasn't this particular bill
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
right so but yeah that is a tremendous
 
05:06:22.250 --> 05:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
Resource as I understand at the
 
05:06:24.230 --> 05:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
oversight committee they can pull people
 
05:06:26.330 --> 05:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
together or work with the Department to
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
pull people together to to work on this
 
05:06:31.910 --> 05:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
and address the many of the concerns
 
05:06:33.050 --> 05:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Weber that you've
 
05:06:34.930 --> 05:06:34.940 align:start position:0%
expressed about stakeholders being
 
05:06:38.570 --> 05:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
so that representative Leon um thank you
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I did speak with um representative
 
05:06:45.410 --> 05:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
Pearson who's the chairman of oversight
 
05:06:49.070 --> 05:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
and um he he also agrees with this need
 
05:06:50.570 --> 05:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
and that it would be a proper thing for
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
oversight to be doing and following up
 
05:06:54.770 --> 05:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
on with his time frame and Mr chairman I
 
05:06:55.850 --> 05:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
noticed that
 
05:06:57.770 --> 05:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
um representative Kay also and
 
05:06:59.868 --> 05:06:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative McKay is himself a former
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
chair of Health and Human Services
 
05:07:02.930 --> 05:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
oversight sure go ahead representative
 
05:07:02.940 --> 05:07:03.890 align:start position:0%
oversight sure go ahead representative
McKay

05:07:03.890 --> 05:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
McKay
 
05:07:08.030 --> 05:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
very taken the other day by
 
05:07:11.520 --> 05:07:12.128 align:start position:0%
very taken the other day by
the

05:07:12.128 --> 05:07:12.138 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:16.850 --> 05:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
anguish that I could see on all sides
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
that of this issue
 
05:07:23.690 --> 05:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
I've done this before in terms of going
 
05:07:25.730 --> 05:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee as well as
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I've got two separate
 
05:07:36.288 --> 05:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
issues and I think that's probably
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
unwise to go with two separate issues
 
05:07:42.530 --> 05:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
but the
 
05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
a person like me in the legislature can
 
05:07:48.770 --> 05:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
go to the oversight present a plan
 
05:07:52.850 --> 05:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
and say this is what I would like to
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
05:07:57.650 --> 05:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
I've already talked to representative
 
05:07:57.660 --> 05:07:58.850 align:start position:0%
I've already talked to representative
Pearson

05:07:58.850 --> 05:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
05:08:01.090 --> 05:08:01.100 align:start position:0%
I've already talked to
 
05:08:03.890 --> 05:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
and those are two of the individuals who
 
05:08:11.948 --> 05:08:11.958 align:start position:0%
have and I think very long history
 
05:08:14.590 --> 05:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
so that
 
05:08:17.448 --> 05:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
part of what I was going to do
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
was dependent on what this committee
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
would do if somebody passes
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
legislation then there's no need for me
 
05:08:27.360 --> 05:08:28.250 align:start position:0%
legislation then there's no need for me
to

05:08:28.250 --> 05:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:29.868 --> 05:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
and the other brand that I have which is
 
05:08:36.610 --> 05:08:36.620 align:start position:0%
restrained a little bit
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
is to have a
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
Committee of
 
05:08:45.530 --> 05:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee dealing with the
 
05:08:47.690 --> 05:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan
 
05:08:51.890 --> 05:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
and the specific issues there
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
the way in which the
 
05:08:56.878 --> 05:08:58.208 align:start position:0%
the way in which the
the

05:08:58.208 --> 05:08:58.218 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:02.170 --> 05:09:02.180 align:start position:0%
so-called borders that thought border
 
05:09:06.410 --> 05:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting slip the
 
05:09:10.750 --> 05:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
the borders uh those individuals today
 
05:09:15.050 --> 05:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
there's probably 30 adults and 25 of 30
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
children waiting to get into New
 
05:09:20.570 --> 05:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
05:09:23.330 --> 05:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
can make that move along
 
05:09:28.970 --> 05:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
is if we use Telehealth one of the
 
05:09:28.980 --> 05:09:30.050 align:start position:0%
is if we use Telehealth one of the
things

05:09:30.050 --> 05:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is we're not paying attention to
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
the law there's a very specific period
 
05:09:37.430 --> 05:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:09:41.090 --> 05:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
that a person goes into a local hospital
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
the doctor says they need to go to New
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
but there's a specific period of time
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
to have a court from the judge water
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
the commitment
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
I am so that
 
05:10:04.930 --> 05:10:04.940 align:start position:0%
so that my original plan
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
was to see if we can't get a committee
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
under the oversight committee to start
 
05:10:15.650 --> 05:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
to get communication among those
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
individuals who seem to be not
 
05:10:18.480 --> 05:10:20.208 align:start position:0%
individuals who seem to be not
communicated

05:10:20.208 --> 05:10:20.218 align:start position:0%
communicated
 
05:10:25.250 --> 05:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
the second one is to emphasize
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
05:10:31.550 --> 05:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
I have a particular interest in this I
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
was chairman of the commission that
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
wrote the 10-year plan 10 years ago and
 
05:10:40.550 --> 05:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't do a damn thing about it you
 
05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
know that's partly because we were in a
 
05:10:45.650 --> 05:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
recession and it was difficult
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh but that the
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity is there
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
and brought away for us that there are
 
05:10:56.820 --> 05:10:58.150 align:start position:0%
and brought away for us that there are
individuals

05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:11:01.610 --> 05:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
from this committee who are members
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
who might very well
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer at the chair
 
05:11:10.550 --> 05:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
just subcommitted and people like me
 
05:11:13.208 --> 05:11:13.218 align:start position:0%
that are willing to do with work
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
I thought it was important to tell the
 
05:11:23.090 --> 05:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
committee that I intend to go to the
 
05:11:26.448 --> 05:11:26.458 align:start position:0%
next oversight committee and bring up
 
05:11:28.250 --> 05:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
these two issues
 
05:11:30.590 --> 05:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know where to answer questions
 
05:11:33.650 --> 05:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:33.660 --> 05:11:35.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:35.280 --> 05:11:36.050 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:11:36.050 --> 05:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:38.750 --> 05:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
05:11:40.010 --> 05:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
um representative land do you have any
 
05:11:40.020 --> 05:11:41.750 align:start position:0%
um representative land do you have any
thoughts

05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
05:11:41.760 --> 05:11:43.490 align:start position:0%
thoughts
um

05:11:43.490 --> 05:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess my one question is if we
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
retain this we can still we can retain
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
this so we can keep the flexibility and
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
we can also ask the oversight committee
 
05:11:54.650 --> 05:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
to work on this correct then if that's
 
05:11:56.208 --> 05:11:56.218 align:start position:0%
the case I would like to withdraw my
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
motion about this amendment
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I will also withdraw my set and I
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
would like to move retain on House Bill
 
05:12:03.120 --> 05:12:05.150 align:start position:0%
would like to move retain on House Bill
608

05:12:05.150 --> 05:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
608
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:12:10.730 --> 05:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative Weber seconds
 
05:12:12.650 --> 05:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion to retain
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608
 
05:12:17.390 --> 05:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
