00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
that I support itl because this confus
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
it with 361 I apologize no problem 199
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay I'll go back this is something
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past uh our committee
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
has always done this we put it in just
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
as a placeholder in case for some Reas
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%

Improvement projects do not make it in
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and I have done this
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
for years with often either represent
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
mcon or represent Graham and usually in
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
the end we haven't needed it because it
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
ends up in the capital budget so I this
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
bill is no longer necessary so I would
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
ask that we uh uh approve the itl motion
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%

Mills for a uh
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chair I move interim study on

HB 606
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
seconded by
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman repres I'm going to vote in
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
favor of interterm study I think this is
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
a well-intentioned bill but it it it I
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
think it does need some work in the
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
sense it talks about state buildings and
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
state funded housing projects I'm not
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
aware of any housing projects and I also
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
believe there's another bill that
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation a study committee House
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 111 and I'm anxious I've have not
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
seen the a final report which should
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
have been filed on November 1 so I'd
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
like to take a look at that and with
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and maybe work something out
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm I think we should be careful
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
about duplicating possibly something
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
that Transportation or this study
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee on house bill 111 is working
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
but I think this is an important issue
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
and I commend the sponsors for doing
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
this but obviously this issue and this
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
bill and uh 606 does need some work uh
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
that we really need to do before we can
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
seconded motion made by Bill seconded by
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
Boyd uh interim study House Bill
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
110 is there a
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
discussion uh Mr chairman I think this
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
is a very contentious and controversial
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
issue I realize we are still Gathering I
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
think data and I think gaset is is
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
consider I don't if they're going to put
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
it in but even if we did put it in term
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
study we're probably going to continue
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
with this ISS issue and it may be part
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
of the debate on the 10-year plan next
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
year so I just the bill itself I have
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
some some problems with uh so I'm I'm
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
commend but I know there are some
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
concerns that the uh sponsors of the
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill are concerned about so I suppose
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's better to listen to them and why
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
they object to passenger rail I'm by the
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
way on the opposite side but I'm trying
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
to keep an open mind so I think interm
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
study for now will delay the process
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
until we can maybe debate it further
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
next year maybe as part of the 10-year
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
plan thank you thank you is there
 
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.910 align:start position:0%
