00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
significant measures in front of us my
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%

race there rated in a tie which I I lost
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
unlike uh Landslide Larry who I
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
apparently won
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
what won his first raised by nine votes
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
and yes he was in the papers all through
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
November uh yeah so real quick I have
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
lived in Manchester I taught at Trinity
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
High School I've also served on the
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
education committee uh a couple terms
 
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
including last term when I did two
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
committees so I lived in Manchester
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
taught uh on many levels um was in the
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps active duty in the 80s uh
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
get out went back in in 1990 I was
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
working in Plymouth State and uh an
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
opening in Maine came up for uh dragons
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
and I met Commander Stapleton in uh in
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
Maine and so I asked my boss at Plymouth
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
a sports information director he said
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
could I look into this Reserve
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity and he's he said well you
 
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:56.220 align:start position:0%
get football games on weekends but we
 
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
could probably support that he said no
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
you're not going to let go to any wars
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
right and I said this is 1990 and I said
 
00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
well the Berlin Wall is coming down and
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going to be pretty
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
peaceful so before the year was over it
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
was dug in on the Saudi Arabia in
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
Kuwaiti border scuds and and we went
 
00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:14.339 align:start position:0%
through the burning oil well field so
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah you never know uh represent
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
Emmanuel mentioned he joined and for
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
those who just came in
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
um he joined in 2001 to kill Bin Laden
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
he's on the record is saying that's why
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
he joined and
 
00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.370 align:start position:0%
he joined and
and

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
um so well speaking of 9 11 I was

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
General Franks at uh at sevcom
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
um did not at that time go into theater
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
although in 2010 uh I I think it was the
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
oldest Marine in Afghanistan that was 54
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
almost 55 on the special assignment they
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
are glad to get over there uh and then
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
Bin Laden was killed the next year as
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%

00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
airplane is 12. we need active duty
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
Manning to help us with the maintenance
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
in the pilots to keep fielding and
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
flying those planes
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
a really unique achievement is about two
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
months ago we set a record an airboat
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
Melody air Mobility command of all
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
transports refuelers cargo plans uh flew
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
with 36-hour non-stop Mission we left
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
peace they flew across North America
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
they went out to Hawaii refueled F-22
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
Raptors flew around Guam and came back
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
and we put three crews on that plane and
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
the reason was is to show um reassurance
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
to our asia-pacific partner specifically
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
Taiwan that we can Flex our Global power
 
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the world it was a truly
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
amazing flight first in its kind the
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
wing flew first 23 hours on an earlier
 
00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
Mission a month later through 36 hours
 
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
so we are strategically relevant with
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
that new refueler and we have Global
 
00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:43.250 align:start position:0%
that new refueler and we have Global
reach

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
reach
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
go to the Army National Guard the Army
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
National Guard is about 1800 strong you
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
probably see them in the communities
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
there we have about 17 armories
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the state if you look at this
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
little pamphlet it just shows you where
 
00:49:59.050 --> 00:49:59.060 align:start position:0%
we are located geographically
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
so we're located throughout the state
 
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.510 align:start position:0%
so we're located throughout the state
um

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know you probably heard or saw us
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
with covid and that's us right we are
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
the only Department of Defense
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
organization with a dual federal state
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
mission right it's the National Guard we
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
call Title 32 our commander-in-chief is
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
a governor he has the ability to
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
activate us and you probably will
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
typically see or hear about us for two
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
things one the first was covid for about
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
two years we supported the state of New
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with just under 800 soldiers
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
and Airmen activated
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
and the second thing you probably hear a
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
lot about us is search and rescue so New
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game does not have
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
helicopters we do last year we did 15
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
search and rescues in the white modern
 
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
national forest and throughout the state
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
um set a record a 88 increase what we
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
did the previous year
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
and so that's when you typically here
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
see us
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
um when you put all together you look at
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
the sort of quality life of our service
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
members and you'll see a sheet on the
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
right hand side that says the New
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard was nominated
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
to be the number eight business in
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
business New Hampshire magazine
 
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
and the criteria was twofold run one
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
number one was um we had to have over 50
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
of our full-time employees you know fill
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
out a survey and number two is based
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
upon the benefits that department
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
defense provides for our service members
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
and you rack and Sack those two major
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
criteria those two factors and we were
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
selected to be the eighth best business
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
to work for in the uh New Hampshire
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
what is the biggest challenge for the
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard uh it's
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
this simple filling our formations
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
um there's no line at our door that next
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
Generation they're propensity to serve
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
in childhood obesity is crushing us the
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
International Guard does a relatively
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
good job because it's proximity to the
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire where about
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
20 percent of our Junior soldiers and
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
Airmen are enrolled in the community
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
college system either in the community
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
college system of New Hampshire or the
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire because the
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
legislature thank you provides our
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
service members with their free tuition
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
waiver at any University
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
that is a big big deal when you ask
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
these younger kids
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
um why do you join it's usually three
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
reasons right
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
for plenty to serve challenge of the
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
military culture and the educational
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
benefits that is a big big deal for us
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
when about 20 of our forces in college
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
um so the International Guard because
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's proximity UNH and just the mission
 
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
that it has we do relatively well
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the Army National Guard we are
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
struggling significantly and I think
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
most people probably hopefully are aware
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
that last year was the worst recruiting
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
year for the Army as an Enterprise for
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
active duty National Garden reserves
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
since the end of the volunteering draft
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
in 1972.
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
um it was horrendous and it did not go
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
well if you look at the active duty Army
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
I just give the simple statistic
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
the active duty Army missed their
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
numbers by over 15
 
00:52:46.319 --> 00:52:47.510 align:start position:0%
numbers by over 15
000.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
um in simple parlance that's an army
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
division there's only 10 of them
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's how bad recruiting was and it
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
trickled down to the state of New
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's just what we call a war
 
00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
for talent low unemployment rate and
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's just no line on our door so
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything you can influence or help us
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
fill our formations it would be
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
sincerely appreciated
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
um on the Mel on the veterans department
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and Veterans Services
 
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start handing off to some
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
of our folks here
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking the big picture we have
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
25 state employees dedicated to veteran
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
programs right so 25 state employees
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
dedicated to three sort of like uh
 
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
organizations State veterans cemetery
 
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
the division of community-based military
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
programs and
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
um the division of Veterans Services
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
so when governor sununu in the
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislature in I think 2019 codified uh
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
the organization or reorganization of
 
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of military and Veterans
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
Services he put everything except Health
 
00:53:49.319 --> 00:53:50.270 align:start position:0%
Services he put everything except Health
Care

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
Care
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
underneath dmabs so I usually like to
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
tell people is that's what we are
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
everything about health care we're not
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
the Manchester VA and we're not the
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
veterans home but anything that touches
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
a 90 plus thousand veterans in the state
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire typically goes through
 
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.609 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire typically goes through
us

00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
so if it's a veteran service officer for
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
a service disability if it's a final uh
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
pressing Place dignified resting place
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
for our veterans or whether it's a
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
community outreach program through a
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
veteran Friendly's business initiative
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
anything that touches veterans it's on
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
us more than myself and I'll sit here
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
and then introduce you to the rest of
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
the staff
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
General before you do that uh before we
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
lose you you take just a minute or two
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
and you and like we just did a whip
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
around and briefly said where we came
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
from and how we get to be where we are I
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
I think some folks especially some of
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
the newer folks uh maybe don't have a
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of the adjective
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
General position uh so if you could take
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%

um I've always been a New Hampshire
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
resident except when I was not when I
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
was on active duty in
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I joined the New Hampshire National
 
00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:39.859 align:start position:0%
Guard in
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
2007 but I've been serving since 1987
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
since I've been commissioned from West
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
Point the adjunct General roles on
 
00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:48.710 align:start position:0%
Point the adjunct General roles on
responsibility

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's different in every single state and
 
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:52.849 align:start position:0%
it's different in every single state and
territory

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:52.859 align:start position:0%
territory
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
generally speaking you're the action in
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
general of your state Military
 
00:55:56.579 --> 00:55:58.250 align:start position:0%
general of your state Military
Department

00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
in other states you can also be the
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Emergency Management or
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of veteran services so
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
we usually say that it's like the big
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
three in New Hampshire for for this
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
position is the big two is veteran
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
services in the military department but
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
if you went to Maine he's uh their
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
action General's in charge of Emergency
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
Management and if you went to Vermont
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're exactly like myself and if you
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
go to Massachusetts they're only the
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
military uh uh Commander
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
the rosary actor in general um it's
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
generally speaking on the army or
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
military side it's you know our army and
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
Air National Guard is a combat Reserve
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
Force for the United States Army United
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
States Air Force so my number one
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
priority is to man and train and equip
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
those forces
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
so 80 of my time uh in my center of
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
gravity is usually Washington DC where I
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
go to National Guard Bureau the Pentagon
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
to leverage uh resources for whether
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
it's Personnel equipment money to bring
 
00:56:59.809 --> 00:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
back to either build new armories build
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
new maintenance facilities to manage and
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
equip our formations
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
by Statute the job or position is
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
someone like a judge where they try to
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
keep the uh the action General
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
apolitical so I could serve till age 65
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't transition and maybe like
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
other commissioner positions do might do
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
with changeover of political parties of
 
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:25.370 align:start position:0%
with changeover of political parties of
Governors

00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.049 --> 00:57:27.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much General and before
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
you hand it off uh I I have one question
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and if anybody else has a question
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
for a tag the gadget in general I'm sure
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
you'll take a question or two but my
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
question and thank you if you're Candor
 
00:57:41.329 --> 00:57:41.339 align:start position:0%
about the recruiting uh problem I knew
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
there was an issue I didn't realize it
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
was is as Grave as you described thanks
 
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
for your honesty on that that's
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
something that we do need to know
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
um my question is in terms of uh
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
recruiting I believe the ages have
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
changed we in recent times in terms of
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh the age range who can look at service
 
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
could you speak to that uh yes sir so
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking you can now join up
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
to age 40. the Navy went to I think 41
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
but um it went from I think 38 to 40 so
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
if you're 40 years of age or less you
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
typically can now join so they just keep
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
expanding and expanding because our pool
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
of candidates Keys keeps shrinking and
 
00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:24.069 align:start position:0%
of candidates Keys keeps shrinking and
shrinking

00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
shrinking
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
40. okay that's interesting
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
um we I we found out earlier General
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
that one of our members uh had a perfect
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
ASVAB score uh I don't think he's 40 yet
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
you may want to recruit him uh I but I
 
00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.089 align:start position:0%
you may want to recruit him uh I but I
don't

00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
I I will leave that to you all questions
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%

some of our programs that we're
 
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
currently working on we launched a lunch
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
and learn services for the New Hampshire

isolation for New Hampshire veterans
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
we provided New Hampshire specific
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%

their civilian home
 
01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:01.490 align:start position:0%
their civilian home
it's

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions for you or for
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
the tag
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
so I think big pictures from the big
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
takeaways is it's this simple right it
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
was two people the legislature passed a
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
veteran Bill of Rights in 2020 and then
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
you resource three additional positions
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
so we thank you right so now we went
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
from two to five so it was
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
administrative admin assistant now we
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
have program Specialists to run
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
different programs whether it's homeless
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
lists uh homeless veteran homelessness
 
01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
licensure and some other initiatives
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
when you look back at the year and you
 
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:33.299 align:start position:0%
look at this little slide or this card
 
01:04:35.569 --> 01:04:35.579 align:start position:0%
you know one side is guard one side's uh
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
veteran services so the two or three big
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
rocks that just happened right one was
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
this initiative called ask the question
 
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
this initiative called ask the question
campaign

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
90 plus thousand veterans in the state
 
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire only a third of them go
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester VA White River
 
01:04:51.059 --> 01:04:52.250 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester VA White River
Junction

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
Junction
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
so how do you get in touch with them at
 
01:04:56.569 --> 01:04:56.579 align:start position:0%
a community mental health provider and
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
so what that initiative did was if
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
you're a veteran and you go to your
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
civilian doctor or that that then that
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh that facility the first thing should
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
happen is the nurse or uh PA might sit
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
down with you and say um are you a
 
01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:10.370 align:start position:0%
down with you and say um are you a
veteran

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
and if you are it then generates a set
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
of questions so we can uh offer more
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
specific services for uh any issues with
 
01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:21.059 align:start position:0%
veterans service of the veteran
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
population that was one number two is
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're honoring the veterans in general
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
so we initiated a with the employment
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
security a veteran friendly business
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
recognition program
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
so it's like uh bronze silver platinum
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
gold so there's different levels right
 
01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
so an employer can say hey look I take
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
care of my veterans these are the things
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
I allow them to do and so we have a
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
structure a category that and I think
 
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:50.099 align:start position:0%
we're up to like 60-ish businesses so
 
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
that then turned into a lunch and learn
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
so those are a lot of just the different
 
01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we're taking that
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do with the veteran
 
01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
service officers for pensions and
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to deal with the the
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
cemetery that's all our Outreach
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative P Money
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Jones
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
um approximately how many veterans are
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%

01:06:21.119 --> 01:06:22.130 align:start position:0%
homeless in the state of Minnesota New
Hampshire

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh currently uh at the last point of
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
time count that we had in January of
 
01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
this year we had
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
um 95 veterans who were experienced
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
homelessness and it breaks down as 80
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
were in transitional housing
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
fiber and Emergency Shelters
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
six are in hotels and four are
 
01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.630 align:start position:0%
six are in hotels and four are
unsheltered

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
unsheltered
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
we all have uh they all have been
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
assigned a provider to work with them on
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
getting them permanent housing some of
 
01:06:59.089 --> 01:06:59.099 align:start position:0%
them have declined services but this is
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
an improvement from 2020 where there
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
were reported 116 veterans experience
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
homelessness in New Hampshire and 101
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
were in temporary transitional housing
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
and 15 were unsheltered so we are making
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
improvements and we are going to
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
continue to do so very good thank you
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%

um saw you yesterday representative
Kerry

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
Kerry
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
um so just a quick overview every I
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
think most everybody hopefully has been
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the veterans cemetery
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
um we have nine full-time employees uh
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
three part-time employees we do about a
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
thousand internments a year last year
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
was 1201 that's the most we've ever done
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
um a couple things I want to highlight
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
though um in case you don't understand
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
so the the veteran the cost for Burial
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
at the Veteran Cemetery is zero for a
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
veteran a qualified veteran pays nothing
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
if they're eligible through the VA then
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
the VA compensates Us by sending us a
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
plot allowance for each veteran and that
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
plot allowances change updated every
 
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
year on October 1st uh and then so we
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
apply for that so once the veteran is
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
interred we apply to the VA and they
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
reimburse us so roughly 50 percent or a
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more of the cost of the
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery is reimbursed from the
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
um last year uh in June 1st we do to
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
your how much your help we passed the
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
burial equity for guards and reserves
 
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.850 align:start position:0%
burial equity for guards and reserves
Act

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
Act
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
um frankly our state legislature our our
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
state legislators down in Washington did
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
a fantastic job they advocated for this
 
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
for years and so now starting June 1st
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
we bury members of the National Guard
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
and the reserve components in our state
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
veterans cemetery the requirement is is
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
that they complete their first term Of
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
Enlistment and they have an other than
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
dishonorable discharge they have to
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrate to us that they did complete
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
that enlistment and show me some sort of
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
discharge certificate that shows I did
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
my four years my five years my six years
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
we do not get reimbursed from the
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
federal government for that the state
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
covers their costs so we do we treat
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
them exactly so as far as they're
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
concerned it's no different we treat
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
them exactly the same no cost for the
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
veteran remember dependents it is a 350
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
fee due on the date of internment so up
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
to now we've buried 29 folks that have
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
fallen in under the barrel equity for
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
garden reserves super proud of our state
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
only three states that I know of bury
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
members of the garden reserves North
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
Dakota has been doing it from the
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
beginning since they opened their state
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery they they that was part
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
of their agreement to open
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
Virginia I believe has done it but they
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
charge like fifteen hundred dollars to
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
the veteran if they're a member of the
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
garden Reserve to be interred and us and
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
we treat our members of the guard and
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
reserves exactly the same as we treat
 
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
those who are eligible under the active
 
01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:22.250 align:start position:0%
those who are eligible under the active
duty

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
duty
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
um super proud of that and when I talked
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
to North Dakota they bury like maybe six
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
or eight a year so we're up to 29 and
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're not even one year into it so this
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
program has really taken off I'm super
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
proud of that
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
second thing I want to highlight the
 
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
veterans cemetery Association we are
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
supported by a group of volunteers that
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
raises money on our behalf helps fund
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
projects on our behalf and the entire
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
Memorial walkway the veterans Heritage
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
Learning Center which is on the back of
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
the admin building all handled by the
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
veterans cemetery Association they do a
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
fantastic job they are a fantastic
 
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.410 align:start position:0%
fantastic job they are a fantastic
organization

01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
third events one of the things I've done
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
as Cemetery directors I've tried to make
 
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
our events very consistent so Memorial
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
Day this is prior to me May 30th 11
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
o'clock so May 30th not on the Monday
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
that everybody celebrates Memorial Day
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
the original Memorial Day May 30th 11
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
o'clock that's when we do our ceremony
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
uh reuse for bosquin we did do a little
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
change to that
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
um we no longer work with reads Across
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
America they are a fantastic
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
organization but we kind of broke away
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
from them we order our wreaths from a
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire company Three Rivers up in
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
Franklin and we do it always the first
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
Saturday of December at 10 30. so again
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
consistency reads Across America would
 
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes move around it'd be the second
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
week the third week no first Saturday
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
December if you come to the state
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery that's when we're
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
putting out reefs and we order our
 
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
wreaths locally
 
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.310 align:start position:0%
wreaths locally
um

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
and then the third event
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
well I guess that's the only two events
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
I really wanted to highlight
 
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.209 align:start position:0%
I really wanted to highlight
um

01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
fourth volunteers we rely on our
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers one of our best programs is
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
the adopt a garden program we have
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
several volunteers they adopt they come
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
out they pick a garden usually it's near
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
a loved one or a place special for them
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
they help us tend that Garden they plant
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
they we provide them with the materials
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
but they do a lot of the labor I
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
generally only have five guys that have
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
to mow all the grass dig all the Grays
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
place all the heads to do everything
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
around the cemetery so the little fine
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
details of pruning flowers things like
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
that sometimes it's at the end of the
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
list so these volunteers are so
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
essential and they are fantastic we have
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
some that show up literally two three
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
times a week and they work in various
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
Gardens so it is awesome and we have
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
tons of other volunteer programs
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
volunteers clean our headstones
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer clean the memorial walkway it
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
is awesome it's a tremendous connection
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
to the community
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
lastly I want to let you know that we
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
have an expansion in case anybody
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
wonders we have 104 Acres we're good for
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
at least to the turn of the century I
 
01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.229 align:start position:0%
at least to the turn of the century I
believe

01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
um in terms of space at the veterans
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
cemetery we do have an expansion
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
happening this coming fiscal year we're
 
01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
going to add uh 10 years worth of
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
columbarium space so the niches where
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
people can put their cremated remains
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're building 12 structures uh well
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
over a thousand more niches to that
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
because we're running short we're about
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
we have about two and a half years of
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
Niche space left for uh columbarium so
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to expand that this coming
 
01:15:19.199 --> 01:15:20.209 align:start position:0%
we're going to expand that this coming
year

01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
so now I stand open for your questions
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
about anything except David yeah I just
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
want to clarify one thing and just to
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
make sure you understand so uh Sean
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
served over 20 plus years in active duty
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
he's a veteran right I served eight plus
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
years active duty and the rest of the
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
guard of reserves I'm a veteran the
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
guard Barrel Equity act if you're a
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
national Guardsman or reservist who's
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
never activated you couldn't get buried
 
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.590 align:start position:0%
never activated you couldn't get buried
there

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's the difference that's why it's
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
Unique that's why we thank you because
 
01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
we're only one of three states who honor
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
our part-time service members regardless
 
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
whether it's naval Reserve Marine
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
reserve we don't care but that person
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
still took an oath to the Constitution
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
to defend this nation against all
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
enemies formed a domestic it's just
 
01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
equal treatment that's why it's Unique
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
and that's why we thank you
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh questions for the next the other Sean
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%

thanks
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.209 --> 01:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
situation if you had a veteran buried in
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
your cemetery and they and the family
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to remove them and put them in
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
their Hometown how do you go about that
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
to have a veteran removed from the
 
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
cemetery we we do do disen tournaments
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
from time to time usually uh folks so
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
just like most any Cemetery somebody
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
wants to remove a veteran from our
 
01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery we don't actually do
 
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:26.940 align:start position:0%
the work they have to hire a funeral
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
home to transport unless it's cremated
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
remains right um so cremated remains
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
they just call us and we We There is a
 
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
fee for disinterment We disinter The
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
Remains hand them back to the family and
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
they can take them wherever they want to
 
01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.530 align:start position:0%
they can take them wherever they want to
so

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example a gentleman
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
used to come to the cemetery all the
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
time great guy
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
um he moved to Maine and so he took his
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
spouse she was cremated we disinterred
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
her and he took her up to the main State
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
Veteran Cemetery and he had her intern
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
there so what is the process you have to
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
go through
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
go to your office and what yeah you just
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
have to put in a request and then like I
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
said there's a fee just call us and
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
we'll take care of it it's usually not a
 
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
problem I will I will tell you one other
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
thing though
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 we put in pre-placed Auto
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
barrel of containers so the the the
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
concrete Vault that caskets go in are
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
already under the ground
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
this has been a very important because
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
it saves veterans the money of having to
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
purchase that Vault I will say we've had
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
not had anybody asked to disinter
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
somebody from there
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and I honestly don't know how we
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
would do that because we have
 
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
disinterred folks that are in
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
in individual Burial Vaults the the
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
funeral the The Vault company just comes
 
01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.219 align:start position:0%
in and they lift the whole Vault out and
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
they take the Vault with the casket in
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
it away on a on a truck
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how we do it I don't
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
know if we could do it in our in the
 
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
pre-placed um that wouldn't be a
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to do that to be honest
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
with you but if it happens I'll figure
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
it out bye thank you for the information
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you're welcome
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh Sean uh so go ahead person Rollins
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
and for the am I on now okay I'm gonna
 
01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
ask this question for the Freshman
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
members here you talked about doing the
 
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
wreaths the first Saturday in December
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
could you expound on the cleanup day
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
roughly when we do that the spring
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
cleanup and the fall cleanup at what
 
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
time of the year we do that and what
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's all about sure as many hands make
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
light work amen to that
 
01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:44.930 align:start position:0%
light work amen to that
um

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
yes sir so we take the wreaths down the
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
first Saturday in January that's not a
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
holiday so this year it happened to be
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
on January 7th which would be the latest
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we would do it uh and that's you
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
this year was like world record time we
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
had about 2 500 wreaths that we put out
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
and uh probably took 30 minutes
 
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
um we had so many people that over a
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
hundred people came to volunteer and the
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
breeze came down we have a pretty good
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
little process that goes honestly the
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
same thing's true when we put out the
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
Reeves we have so many volunteers this
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
year we had to be close to a thousand
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
people that were there
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
um the parking is always really
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
difficult great thanks to the boscoin
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
police department and the Merrimack
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
County Sheriff because they come out and
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
helped control traffic because that's my
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
number one concern is that somebody
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
would ever get hurt
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you know out on Route three
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the memorial walkway cleanup happens
 
01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
typically at the end of April is
 
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
sponsored by Rolling Thunder of New
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then we also the Air Force
 
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
Academy Association of graduates and the
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
gold star families at the same day they
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
help they clean headstones so that
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
usually happens on a Sunday morning at
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
the end of April it always kind of
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
depends on the weather and we kind of
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
coordinate that and then we do another
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
cleanup headstone cleaning and walkway
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
cleanup with the same groups the right
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
the weekend before Veterans Day to make
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
sure the walkway is looking good
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
um we back I don't want to open up a can
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
of worms but back in the day we used we
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
do we do not do a Veterans Day service
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
at the veterans cemetery
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
um anymore we did back in the day but we
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
no longer do and the reason for that is
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
we want folks out in their communities
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
um because there's communities do all
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of events schools do events and we
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
wanted folks going there we didn't want
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
to be competing we never want to compete
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
with any other organization that's
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
trying to honor veterans which is the
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
reason that we do our Memorial Day on
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
May 30th at 11 o'clock we've staked that
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
out and so that everybody knows and so
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
that if they want to do it at their
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
school in their Town we're not competing
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
against that and so that's kind of one
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the things we always take into
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
account did I answer your question sir
 
01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:43.550 align:start position:0%
account did I answer your question sir
yeah

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.370 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:21:45.370 --> 01:21:45.380 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
I just like to commend you on what a
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
great job you people do with such a
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
small staff that Cemetery for those
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
who've not been there before is
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely immaculate it reminds you of
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
Arlington and I would like to recommend
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
to any of the other members here that
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been down take a ride down there
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
sometime mark it on your calendar to do
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
the resacross America you better get
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
there early because so many people show
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
up to do that that sometimes you have to
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
shut the traffic off it is something
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
that you will never forget it's a great
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
feeling and for me every year I do it
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
what it really impresses me is the
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
parents that bring their children to
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
teach their children what this is all
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
about yeah absolutely and thank you for

together to uh do the best we can for
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
people representative Alvin C uh is a
 
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
new rep uh vascoin is in his floaterial
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
district as well he's a Vietnam era
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
Naval veteran FYI uh I was going to ask
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
you about the spouse piece of it but you
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
touched on that a lot of folks don't
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
realize that spouses uh many spouses are
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
there now
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
um somebody pointed out once so there
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
was a veteran who was a widower he
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
remarried and he ended up uh spending
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
eternity with both of his wives does
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
that happen in well so let me I think
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
um I like to tell people the spouse is
 
01:24:23.699 --> 01:24:24.729 align:start position:0%
um I like to tell people the spouse is
eligible

01:24:24.729 --> 01:24:24.739 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
through the veteran so it was as long as
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
they're married when either one of them
 
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.550 align:start position:0%
they're married when either one of them
passes

01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
the spouse can be interred at the
 
01:24:34.729 --> 01:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
cemetery first a lot of people have that
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
notion that the veteran has to be the
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
first not true and in honesty the spouse
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
can be buried there and the veteran
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to come the spouse has
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
earned the spot just like the veteran
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
and to answer your question if the
 
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
veteran if the spouse passes and the
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
veteran remarries that new spouse is
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
also eligible so yes that can happen
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
um generally they wouldn't all be in the
 
01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.890 align:start position:0%
um generally they wouldn't all be in the
same

01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
plot but that could happen
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
um but I generally one wouldn't want
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
that you know but yeah we can we honor I
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
think it's important to understand that
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
we honor families I mean it's not easy
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
to be married to a veteran or an active
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
dirty member or anybody else and so we
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we honor them
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
as well uh and the last thing I'll
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
mention dependence people ask this
 
01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:25.460 align:start position:0%
question all the time children
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
children of veterans can be eligible if
 
01:25:32.209 --> 01:25:32.219 align:start position:0%
they're minors if they're still in
 
01:25:32.219 --> 01:25:33.229 align:start position:0%
they're minors if they're still in
college

01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
or if they have a permanent disability
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
that does not ever allow them to live on
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
um so you know if they have some sort of
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
disability that they have to live with
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
the parents or they have to live in a
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
special cause they would be eligible
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
um as well so if there's ever questions
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
just call and ask we'll answer your
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
questions and I never tells
 
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
anybody who's had anything to do with
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
the military haven't talked to us and
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
apply don't self-select out let us tell
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
you whether you're eligible or not we
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we get paid to do
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
sanction I did not realize the uh the
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
the child the dependent or the child
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
piece of this that's new to me that's
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
great new information other questions
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
yes right here uh representative gagne
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your Indulgence
 
01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:18.610 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your Indulgence
uh

01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:18.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
the proof of service that's the DD214 is
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
yes typically it is sometimes so members
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the garden reserves the only DD214
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes they have is from basic
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
training so it's not enough
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
um so from the guards NGB 22
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
um for the reserves honestly the
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
reserves is the most difficult paperwork
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
and we've we we say bring us anything
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
that you have and you know sometimes
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
it's drill roll sometimes it's discharge
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
certificates whatever but typically
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
DD214 that's the easiest the reason I
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
was asking is the Freshman members some
 
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
of them who may not have
 
01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:03.500 align:start position:0%
service members and now that they are in
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affairs that somebody would ask
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
me oh you're in that committee well how
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
do I do this thus and so so the simplest
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
one is the dd240 absolutely and our
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
application is on our website it's a
 
01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's at the cemetery we have hard copies
 
01:27:20.209 --> 01:27:20.219 align:start position:0%
just got a whole bunch of new ones
 
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
picked them up this week
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
um so yeah absolutely and again if any
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
of your constituents have questions just
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
point them to me I mean anything about
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
the Veteran Cemetery you don't have to
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
bother this busy man here just to send
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
them straight to me and I'm sure he
 
01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%

I graduated and uh and joined the Navy
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
from where where New Hampshire I spent
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
30 years on active duty retired in 2016
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
and in 2017 I became a veteran service
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
officer for the for the division of
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
veteran services and by August I was
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
made the director of the agency
 
01:28:49.729 --> 01:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
um I absolutely love my job I love what
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
I do I used to tell people when I
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
retired from the Navy I would do another
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
30 years tomorrow if they allowed me and
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
then I've got this job and there's no
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
way I'd go back this is just way too
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
important and this is just it's a
 
01:29:00.290 --> 01:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job and I'm very appreciative
 
01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
that I have this job what we do at
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
division of Veterans Services our
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
mission is we help veterans and their
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
families secure the benefits that they
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
have earned through their service in the
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
military we focus mostly on on
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
compensation disability compensation
 
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
with the VA and primarily reason why we
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
focus on that is because for a lot of
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
the other benefits that you receive from
 
01:29:23.570 --> 01:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
the Veterans Administration they have
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
advocates for you so if you're looking
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
for Education if you pick up the phone
 
01:29:29.450 --> 01:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
and dial the 1-800 number there will be
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
somebody on the other in the line who
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
will answer those questions about
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
education and hopefully there'll be a
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
smile in that in that conversation the
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
same thing goes for home loan guarantees
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh and for vocal rehab but when you
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
start talking about disability
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
compensation because you're filing a
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
claim against the VA that's where the
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
conversation ends and they tell you you
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
need an advocate because they're not
 
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:52.139 align:start position:0%
going to tell you how to win a claim
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
against them
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
so that's where we come in and we're not
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
the only uh agency that we're not the
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
only ones doing this the American Legion
 
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
the VFW the DAV they also have service
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
officers and at the end of the day
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter to me who you go see
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
we don't compete against each other we
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
have about a hundred thousand veterans
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and only
 
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
about 20 people doing what we do so
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of clients there's plenty
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
of work to be done uh if John Barrett if
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
you were told John Barrett's a guy to go
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
see what the VFW please go see John he's
 
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
an amazing Service Officer he's been
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
doing it for a lot of years we are your
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
state representatives so I work for the
 
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.770 align:start position:0%
state representatives so I work for the
governor

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
um we do it a little differently than
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
they do so for the national uh for the
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
the VFW the American Legion the DAV they
 
01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
only have one service officer for the
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
entire State they may have Post Service
 
01:30:40.129 --> 01:30:40.139 align:start position:0%
officers but those people just really
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of take your paperwork and
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
hand them over to the the national
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
service officers I have seven service
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
officers I have a much larger staff and
 
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
my service officers are strategically
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
located throughout the state whereas if
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
you want to go to the other
 
01:30:54.530 --> 01:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
organizations they're in Manchester so
 
01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
if you live up in the North Country you
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
have to drive down to Manchester to see
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh John Barrett so my service officers
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
are located in Nashua I have a service
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
officer out in Keene Portsmouth I have
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
two in Manchester because obviously
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester is a large area and I have
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
two in Concord that share time with in
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
Concord and up also up in the North
 
01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
Country to include Littleton Berlin
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
Conway and and Groveton so we are all
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
over the state literally
 
01:31:22.729 --> 01:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
I am all over the state I start off as a
 
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
vso which I think was an amazing part of
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
my progression to be the director
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
because I understand what it takes to be
 
01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
a vso and I still do vso work today in
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
fact I was up in Conway yesterday
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
meeting with clients and that's what we
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
do we meet with veterans and we help
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
them through this VA process
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
my job in the Navy was a foreign
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
Communications intelligence analyst and
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
I thought I was a smart guy until I sat
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
down to do my first claim and it was
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
just no way no way I think veterans
 
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
should be having to do this on their own
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
so we advocate for them in that process
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
so we meet with them out at these
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
locations and we sit down with them for
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
about an hour and we hear what they have
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
to say and we help them in the process
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
of submitting that claim and it will be
 
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
a cradle to grave approach to the claim
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
so we can start with the initial claim
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
for compensation all the way up to
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
assisting a spouse with potentially
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
receiving survivors benefits so we
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
helped through the entire process to
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
include increases when disabilities tend
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
to get worse
 
01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
um as you can see from the numbers
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
approximately we have about 220
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
appointments that we that we held every
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
month that's the seven service officers
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
split between the seven service officers
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
we help uh bring in about 93 million
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
dollars a year into the pockets of
 
01:32:33.169 --> 01:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
veterans that's through the combination
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
of veterans uh disability compensation
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
veterans pension and also uh uh
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
survivors benefits so between those
 
01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:43.139 align:start position:0%
three pots there's about 93 million
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that's coming from the VA into
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and the average time right now the VA
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
is taking to process a claim is about
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
157 days and so just to help people
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand that not 157 days because
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
they've established that as their
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
process it's 157 days because they have
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
so many people in the system
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and there's so many people looking
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
for benefits and they're not they don't
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
just live in New Hampshire they live all
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
over the country so right now it's 157
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
days we do what we can to make that from
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
our perspective as easy as possible and
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
that is to work with the veteran to make
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
sure they have all the evidence and
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
everything they need to process that
 
01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.709 align:start position:0%
everything they need to process that
claim

01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
claim
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
additionally we also help them with
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
state benefits we help also help them
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
understand state benefits I get calls
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
all the time from from state legislators
 
01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
and from constituents of yours asking
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
about property tax credits I help them
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
understand how that works
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
um and at the end of the day I may not
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
be able to help your veterans with
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
everything but I think I would be a good
 
01:33:40.129 --> 01:33:40.139 align:start position:0%
place to start if your veteran has
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
questions not necessarily to call the
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
agency to get an appointment but you can
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
call me and I will do what I what I can
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
to answer their questions
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh you have on your paper it has my name
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
it has my phone number and it has my
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
email email is really honestly the best
 
01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
way to get a hold of me because I am in
 
01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
and out of the office constantly uh but
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
if you're going to call me I wouldn't
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
recommend that number that you have on
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
your paper I would recommend contacting
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
me via my work cell and I won't mind
 
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
giving that to you now or I can provide
 
01:34:10.450 --> 01:34:10.460 align:start position:0%
that to you somebody later but it's 603
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
eight five one
 
01:34:16.129 --> 01:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
seven five five
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
I may not be able to answer you right
 
01:34:17.639 --> 01:34:18.770 align:start position:0%
I may not be able to answer you right
away

01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
um I will get back to you uh at least
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
within the you know within a day or two
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh unless I'm on vacation
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and we do uh provide some other
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
services uh we do have the at least the
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
office provides some additional Services
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
we do have the
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
decal program so the state of New
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a few years ago decided uh
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to do a decal program
 
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
for license plates
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
so I guess some some snowbirds driving
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
down saw some other states that had
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
special decals on license plates and
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
they were like hey we need some of those
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
so the state of New Hampshire does that
 
01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
um the way it works is if you're a
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
veteran you go purchase the plate from
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
DMV and then you have to come to us to
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
get your decal and the decals that we
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
provide currently are service decals so
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
we have a decal for Army Navy Air Force
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
Marines Coast Guard and we also have the
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
space force we've created and gotten
 
01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.110 align:start position:0%
space force we've created and gotten
that

01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
and then we also have Medals of Valor
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
currently I guess there's some
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislation coming forward that will
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
potentially add some additional stickers
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
or decals but right now we do Medals of
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
Valor so we're talking
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
Medal of Honor bronze star with v Silver
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
Star Navy cross so we provide a lot of
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
those metals of Valor so that's
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
primarily what we do and that's pending
 
01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:42.179 align:start position:0%
representative Kerry
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things you mentioned was the
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
property tax credit for veterans and
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
don't I understand the New Hampshire
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
legislature made a little change in
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
those credits so every town needs to
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
reaffirm their veterans property tax
 
01:35:59.090 --> 01:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
credits both you know disabled veterans
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
as well as all veterans credit uh yes
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
representative so what the state did is
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
they changed and added active duty to
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
the conversation so prior to this the
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
only active duty that would get the
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a property tax credit
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
would be those that were currently
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
deployed on active duty in a combat area
 
01:36:20.689 --> 01:36:20.699 align:start position:0%
well the law has changed and now act the
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
a recruiter who's here in New Hampshire
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
serving on active duty can now get a
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
property tax credit
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
um but but again as you stated the they
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
did change the law because they changed
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
the law now all the cities and states
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
have to reconfirm
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
not the standard tax credit they have to
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
reconfirm the all veterans tax credit
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
which is enabling legislation that each
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
Town gets to decide whether or not they
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
want to push forward
 
01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.110 align:start position:0%
want to push forward
so

01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
the questions for uh yes representative
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative O'Neill
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I had a meeting with a client the
 
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
other day excuse me I do estate planning
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
so we run into the property tax issue
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
here and there as well and one of the
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions that she had asked was so her
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
husband is deceased he was a veteran she
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
was receiving the property tax credit
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
um but she recently remarried and was
 
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
told that she would lose it at this
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
point is that is that accurate and that
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
is accurate um and I will stay for the
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
from the perspect of the VA that happens
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
as well so when you divorce a veteran
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
you divorce the VA uh you divorce
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
veterans benefits when your veteran
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
passes away you get to keep those
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
benefits until you remarry unless of
 
01:37:26.810 --> 01:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
course you remarry a veteran then you
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
retain or you gain back the same
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
benefits so and the state works the same
 
01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.169 align:start position:0%
benefits so and the state works the same
way

01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
great question other questions
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative Charlotte
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
well first of all thank you for what
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
you're doing it's so important and uh
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
especially to all our veterans and thank
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
you the question I had is I know years
 
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
ago New Hampshire had a federal veterans
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
Service Officer
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
um is that position still
 
01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
build in New Hampshire or is
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
so I I've never heard of a federal uh
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
vso and that's primarily because I don't
 
01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
believe a vso doesn't do advocations so
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
there was a there was a gentleman that
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
worked at the VA hospital in Manchester
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
his name was Beauregard and he worked
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
for the VA
 
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
that could be what I was thinking a lot
 
01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:18.659 align:start position:0%
of people thought Beau was a uh was a
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
vso but he really honestly was just
 
01:38:22.610 --> 01:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
taking paperwork he goes okay he can't
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
again as an employee for the VA he can't
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
advocate for veterans he can take
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
paperwork tell veterans what they need
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
but if a veteran has a question what do
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
you think I should do one they can't
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
suggest that that's where we come in
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
saying none Bill I just want to thank
 
01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
you again as uh representative shurliff
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
just said for all that you do I know I
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
have your name in my list of people
 
01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:49.139 align:start position:0%
go-to people
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
um early we talked about a the latest
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
directory when that uh comes out for all
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
the different areas and in the veterans
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
world uh so that you're not you know the
 
01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse for there are some
 
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
questions that don't need to go to you
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
that we want to send them to the uh
 
01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
better place when that directory is
 
01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
ready if you could just alert me alert
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
us so we could get that latest
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes chairman um so I'll just let you
 
01:39:14.689 --> 01:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
know that I do have I I have it in soft
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
copy and what I can do is I can just
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
email it to you I have your email
 
01:39:19.490 --> 01:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
contact this way you can get it out to
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
everybody we do print it out and have it
 
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire employment security
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
helps us with that we actually partnered
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
with them to create the resource
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
directory and keep in mind it's not a
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
end-all be-all uh what you're not going
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
to find in there is you're not going to
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
probably find you're not gonna find
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
501c's you're not going to find the uh
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know the charitable organizations or
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
the philanthropic organizations that are
 
01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
out there providing Services as well
 
01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:42.659 align:start position:0%
right we can't forget those
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
organizations what mostly you'll find
 
01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:46.580 align:start position:0%
the resource directory is state level
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
resources you know like Employment
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
Security and the devops that they have
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
there to help veterans with employment
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh it'll be things like mental health
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
and the different things that are
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
available for mental health in for
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
veterans in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
so that's really what you're going to
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
find the resource guide so we'll all
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
provide that but again what I will say
 
01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh chairman is don't hesitate to call
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%

01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
not Bill's too busy and I will and I

thank you thank you thank you represent
 
01:40:38.209 --> 01:40:38.219 align:start position:0%
Rollins and uh I will point out I think
 
01:40:40.729 --> 01:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
that the committee hearings here in the
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
house I've been to several this past
 
01:40:44.450 --> 01:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
week and they are on YouTube I've gone
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
back to look at pieces of them I'm
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
thinking this is uh live or being
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
recorded uh forever uh so whoever's
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
watching this or there were people who
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
come back to look at pieces of this
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
later so uh all your testimony so to
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
speak or your your input will be out
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
there for people to uh uh fast forward
 
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:07.820 align:start position:0%
to we're fine and look at just FYI
 
01:41:11.209 --> 01:41:11.219 align:start position:0%
anything else for Bill guedrow uh
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
General uh sorry I have two Alibis
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
um L by number one is just deployment so
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
for the incoming refreshment
 
01:41:20.209 --> 01:41:20.219 align:start position:0%
Representatives um the deployments and
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
how to read a service members uniform so
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
generally in the Army the patch to your
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
left hand side is the unit you're
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
currently are currently in so if you see
 
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
someone Supermarket the patch on your
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
right side is your sort of combat
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
deployment patch I just want to make
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
sure everyone sort of understands that
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
and uh speaking of deployments at any
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
given time New Hampshire National Guard
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
has a significant number of service
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
members deployed so right now we have
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
300 120 are in the Middle East 170 are
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
on the Southwest border and we have
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
onesie twosies in Europe Japan Cuba if
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
there's a country we probably have a
 
01:41:57.370 --> 01:41:57.380 align:start position:0%
service member overseas
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
the next thing is when the 120 come back
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
from the Middle East we ship off another
 
01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
280 to the Middle East and then we'll
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
ship off in later in the summer our
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
cyber unit to the national capital
 
01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:09.659 align:start position:0%
region so we're busy we're always busy
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
and so when you think about those
 
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
deployments that's 9 to 12 months at a
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
service member is leaving both this
 
01:42:18.169 --> 01:42:18.179 align:start position:0%
family as an employer just want to make
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
sure you understand that like
 
01:42:19.679 --> 01:42:20.390 align:start position:0%
sure you understand that like
um

01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
your business is steady it hasn't really
 
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
slowed down and so we just can't keep
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
doing what we need to do in defense of
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
our nation uh second Alibi is when you
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
look at legislative initiatives it's all
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
the sheets in here you'll see two that
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
we would uh well obviously request for a
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
favorable opinion of them and they both
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
have to deal with filling our formations
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
and I don't remember the house bill
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
numbers were off the top of my head but
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking you might see these
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
two in separate uh bills one is um we're
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
both a family business and a referral
 
01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:55.139 align:start position:0%
business eighty percent of new recruits
 
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
come from a military family and also
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a word of mouth business right so
 
01:43:01.129 --> 01:43:01.139 align:start position:0%
just like state government and some
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
employers we are currently offering a
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
500 referral bonus to any service member
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
below the rank of the captain that
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
recommends someone for military service
 
01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire National Guard we're
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
trying to increase that to a thousand
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
dollars I've been told by today's
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
generation uh 500 is a ashrae change in
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
your car I thought that was a big deal
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
when I was a kid apparently nowadays
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's not so trying to go from 500 to a
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
thousand and always remember there's two
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
levers trying to get the people to come
 
01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%
in and trying to retain the people you
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
currently have and a sessions and
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
retention that's in a sessions tool the
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
retention tool is
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh community college system of New
 
01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:41.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was spectacular last session
 
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
we expanded our tuition waiver program
 
01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:48.659 align:start position:0%
that you can now transfer to your spouse
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
your common phrase is the service member
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
of volunteers but the family of the
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
spouse gets drafted so we're expanding
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
that program now to the university
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire
 
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
so if a soldier Airman reenlists Beyond
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
six years either or he or she or their
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
spouse can now transfer that benefit to
 
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
allow he or she the spouse to take
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
classes at the community college and now
 
01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
the university system of New Hampshire
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
so that's a retention tool so I just you
 
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
know want to let you know those are two
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
significant uh bills for us and we just

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
a big steel desk in Germany which you
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
want a fighter pilot to sit behind a
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
desk the only thing that matters is the
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
location of the desk I'd rather be the
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
snow removal officer over there than the
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
chief of staff in the Pentagon believe
 
01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.090 align:start position:0%
chief of staff in the Pentagon believe
me

01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so then I got tired of sitting behind
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
a desk realized that you know they're
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
not going to let the old man fly f-15s
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
anymore flew 737s for United for about
 
01:51:21.290 --> 01:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
five and a half years got tired of being
 
01:51:24.290 --> 01:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
gone literally all the time so I opened
 
01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
up the Air Force Junior ROTC program
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
down at Auburn High School in Hudson
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
where I uh I taught for 11 years in a
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
public high school and then after that I
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
retired retired retired my wife makes me
 
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
say it three times so that I don't take
 
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
another job I'm sure some of you can
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
relate to that I have been with the
 
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
state veterans advisory committee now as
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
a a member of the Air Force Association
 
01:51:49.629 --> 01:51:49.639 align:start position:0%
which is now the air and space forces
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
Association since 2006 we've been around
 
01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
since 2002 and you have the handout
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
there with our history
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
I became the legislative chair
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
um in 2016. some of you may have if
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
you've been around the the uh the house
 
01:52:08.090 --> 01:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
a while you some of you may have
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
remembered Ed Josephson in this position
 
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
before me and when Ed passed away in
 
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
2016 since Ed also represented the Air
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
Force Association it it passed to me to
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
be the legislative chair and what I do
 
01:52:22.910 --> 01:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
generally is when the when the
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar you know when they
 
01:52:26.689 --> 01:52:26.699 align:start position:0%
when we start seeing the lsrs in the
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
fall I scrub all of them and try and
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
figure out which ones have veteran
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
impact and then we take a vote at our
 
01:52:34.609 --> 01:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
committee meeting about whether we
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
support or oppose or some of them would
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
just like to sit like a fly on the wall
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
and we call it follow we're going to go
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
and see see which way the wind is
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
blowing we do that sometimes on bills
 
01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
and then I go and I tell you what it is
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
that that we think and I'll be here next
 
01:52:52.609 --> 01:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
Friday there's three bills and I thank
 
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:55.260 align:start position:0%

I want to give you an idea of kind of
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
what a typical meeting looks like for us
 
01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:42.659 align:start position:0%
and you know we we have guest speakers
 
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
that come in and uh and tell us about
 
01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
what they're doing to help veterans or
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
they solicit our help getting started or
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
they solicit our help in figuring out
 
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
the right place to go uh to get things
 
01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
done uh there then we hear from the VA
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
medical centers Kevin Forrest is usually
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
there when we used to do this by Zoom Dr
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
bash open in White River Junction
 
01:54:06.050 --> 01:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
Junction would appear and tell us what's
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
going on over there and with the sea box
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
we have in the state
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
um and then then we have the all of the
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
Departments you just heard from kind of
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
tell us what they're what they're
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
thinking and what they're working on the
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
commandant of the veterans uh the
 
01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home comes and tells us about
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
how things are are going up there uh and
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
then you know I I kind of keep up with
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
what we're doing uh of a legislative uh
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
nature here the other thing we do we
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually have a representative from the
 
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
governor and we have a representative
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
from all of our Congressional
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
Representatives that attend this meeting
 
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
and their their purpose is literally
 
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
twofold one number one they're reporting
 
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
back to their bosses of what we're
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
talking about and then they're also
 
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
there as a to tell us what their bosses
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
are working on that have better an
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
impact in Washington D.C so it's great
 
01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:57.659 align:start position:0%
we have access to those folks
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%

Republicans but no one works harder for
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%

Force Academy so I've got I see I have a
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
lot of different constituencies that I
 
01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
can pass information to and I typically
 
01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:38.689 align:start position:0%
can pass information to and I typically
do

01:56:38.689 --> 01:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that that we are is
 
01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
kind of a a a huge room full of
 
01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
corporate knowledge about stuff about
 
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
especially stuff about how to help
 
01:56:50.209 --> 01:56:50.219 align:start position:0%
veterans and I'll give you sort of a
 
01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
little bit of a success story on that
 
01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
front about six or seven years ago I
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
can't remember probably about six years
 
01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
ago Governor sununu right after he was
 
01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
re-elected for the for the first time
 
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
came to see us
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
and he talked to us for about five
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
minutes and then he looked up and he
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
said if I have a veteran that has a
 
01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:13.729 align:start position:0%
said if I have a veteran that has a
problem

01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
where do I send them
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
and we all looked at each other and we
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of acknowledged you know the answer
 
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
is probably somewhere in this room but
 
01:57:25.609 --> 01:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
we don't really have a single belly
 
01:57:27.290 --> 01:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
button point of contact that we can
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
point people to that that you know that
 
01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
can get this done and what that
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
precipitated that visit started the
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
process that has produced what you have
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
today in the department of military uh
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services so those
 
01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
those things you know having the
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
governor come and ask us a question we
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer was in fact pretty
 
01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
important to getting getting better
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
stuff done for our veterans
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
um you know we also have access to the
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
to the Congressional Delegation
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
um every every meeting somebody asks a
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
question of one of our Congressional
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
reps about something and then and that
 
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
answer gets back to all of us so that's
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
a great thing the last thing I'll close
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
with and I'll let Paul or or this
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
handsome gentleman here to my left is
 
01:58:16.729 --> 01:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
the was the is uh Commander Dave Kinney
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
he was the uh chair of the state
 
01:58:21.050 --> 01:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee before Paul
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'll let them have a chance to speak if
 
01:58:26.209 --> 01:58:26.219 align:start position:0%
you want here's how you can help us
 
01:58:29.209 --> 01:58:29.219 align:start position:0%
my least favorite thing in the entire
 
01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:33.659 align:start position:0%
world is to go and testify at a hearing
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
about a bill that's supposed to help
 
01:58:38.450 --> 01:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
veterans that we don't support that we
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
oppose that's that's my least favorite
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
thing in the whole world okay so if
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
you're going to to file a bill to help
 
01:58:45.659 --> 01:58:46.729 align:start position:0%
you're going to to file a bill to help
veterans

01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
then you know we're a resource that you
 
01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
can use we'll help you with the language
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
we will maybe we've had the corporate
 
01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
history that could tell you well this
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
was tried before and here's what
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
happened on it when it happened before
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
we maybe we may have that kind of
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
expertise that can help you out as well
 
01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
I I had a moment last year when I was
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
testifying at a bill that we did not
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
support where a senator actually looked
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
at me and said well did you talk to the
 
01:59:15.890 --> 01:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor about this bill before you
 
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh decided you're going to oppose it
 
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
okay lesson learned so now this this
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
year and going forward every time a bill
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
goes in that we don't that we are not
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
going to support I reach out I'm going
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
to reach out to that bill sponsor and
 
01:59:32.089 --> 01:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
say I'm sorry but we don't support your
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill you know
 
01:59:36.290 --> 01:59:36.300 align:start position:0%

realistic uh more so on the second one
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%

note to self move these speakers
 
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
note to self move these speakers
I

02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
was an Air Force veteran and a member of
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Air National Guard so
 
02:06:02.930 --> 02:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
I served seven years I went to Pilot
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
training with United States Air Force
 
02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
and then got out because I had friends
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
who flew for this Guard unit I came to
 
02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
peas and served the remainder of my
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
total of 30 years of military service
 
02:06:17.689 --> 02:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
at the completion of my term and
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
retiring in 2009 then the accident
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
General Bill Riddell said hey why don't
 
02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
you do a little pro bono work there Mr
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
smartypants and go be the president of
 
02:06:30.530 --> 02:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
the National Guard Association of New
 
02:06:32.330 --> 02:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to which I said absolutely
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
because almost everything that has ever
 
02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
been really kind of given to me that's
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
including my wife all the great things
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
in life have come from my association
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
with this Air Guard unit and this
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
National Guard
 
02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
I am also on the board of directors and
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
so your front page uh has the two
 
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
associations the National Guard
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
Association in the United States is a is
 
02:07:01.550 --> 02:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
literally the legislative uh entity that
 
02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
fights for legislation for the Army and
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
Air National Guard and their website is
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
there I'm not about to sit and tell you
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
all the different things they do but
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's an association of associations 54
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
states and territories of which we are
 
02:07:19.250 --> 02:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
and so their mission and vision
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
statement is there more importantly the
 
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
one below it is our association our
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
mission statement the three big words
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
that I always like to say to people to
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
support past present and future right so
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
the people are veterans the people that
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
are currently serving and the people
 
02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:39.179 align:start position:0%
that will serve just as the actions
 
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
General said we're always recruiting for
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
that next person who's going to become
 
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
the adjective General and finally
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
relevance Readiness modernization and
 
02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
quality of life so that's really our
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
Mantra that's what we do and we do work
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
with the Congressional Delegation
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
because there is a legislative side to
 
02:08:01.850 --> 02:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
our association and there's also a
 
02:08:04.070 --> 02:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
philanthropic side we use corporate
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
Partners here in the state of New
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and larger companies Service
 
02:08:09.649 --> 02:08:09.659 align:start position:0%
Credit Union is a person that we work
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
with as well as Boeing Airbus and we
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
take those funds and then we distribute
 
02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
them to our service men and women in
 
02:08:19.850 --> 02:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
different forms and Fashions because as
 
02:08:21.770 --> 02:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
you all well know it's the color of
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
money and you can't always necessarily
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
take money out of a military budget that
 
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be doing one thing and
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
support other things
 
02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
so that's how I work with the adjective
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
General one-on-one to support those
 
02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
local unit things that we do our website
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
is currently under construction so it's
 
02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:43.260 align:start position:0%
not as robust as the National Guard
 
02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
Association is but they are both we work
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
in together with our corporate Partners
 
02:08:52.609 --> 02:08:52.619 align:start position:0%
as I say I was a pilot I was a
 
02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
traditional Guardsman so I did this
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
part-time and of course as you all well
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
know with some of the places we've gone
 
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
and some of the places we have been and
 
02:09:04.609 --> 02:09:04.619 align:start position:0%
everything from Desert Storm Desert
 
02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:07.619 align:start position:0%
Shield all the way back we have been
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
busy a last thing that I did was in
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
Joint Force Headquarters work the KC 46
 
02:09:16.970 --> 02:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
which gives you a lead-in to the next
 
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
page as you all well know Senator
 
02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
Shaheen is now on her third third term
 
02:09:24.649 --> 02:09:24.659 align:start position:0%
in the United States Senate she is on
 
02:09:26.689 --> 02:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
the Senate armed services committee and
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
Senate Appropriations defense
 
02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:29.990 align:start position:0%
Senate Appropriations defense
subcommittee

02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
she and us and we told the total New
 
02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State of New Hampshire worked
 
02:09:39.550 --> 02:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
very hard to get this kc-46 this KC 46
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
as you have already been briefed has a
 
02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
big footprint because it unlike the old
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
airplane we that I flew that we flew is
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
in-flight air refuelable so when we talk
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
about the projection of air power across
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
the world that is one of those kind of
 
02:09:59.209 --> 02:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
things that gets everybody's attention I
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
have sat out on the Airfield in Guam
 
02:10:02.699 --> 02:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
have sat out on the Airfield in Guam
when

02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
b2s were landed strictly because they
 
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
were there to have the satellite fly
 
02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
over and say hi we're here I mean our
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
ability to project air power and land
 
02:10:17.689 --> 02:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
forces are making a difference
 
02:10:20.450 --> 02:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the world and so for you
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
to support the people that support that
 
02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
portion of our government and our
 
02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
ability to keep peace is enormous which
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
is why once again I will thank you for
 
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
serving on this committee and in serving
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
for the things that we do
 
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
we as the attention Journal likes to say
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh fight way above our weight class here
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and
 
02:10:46.129 --> 02:10:46.139 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen is just one of many
 
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
examples of that number three and I'm
 
02:10:51.530 --> 02:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
moving as quickly as I possibly can So
 
02:10:52.970 --> 02:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
when you say well what do you do
 
02:10:55.370 --> 02:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
legislatively like what is it that you
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
do I bet you a bunch of people who
 
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
didn't know what high Mars was until a
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
little bit ago until we sent some to
 
02:11:06.410 --> 02:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
Ukraine so one of the things that we do
 
02:11:08.750 --> 02:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to be relevant
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
right and we're trying to stay
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
concurrent with the United States Army
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
and Air Force this is a just a copy of
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
the resolution it sits on the nogus
 
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
website that was submitted by our own uh
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
entity and it has to do with high
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
Mobility artillery rocket system and
 
02:11:29.689 --> 02:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
here's a perfect example the the
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
battalions in the Army are three by nine
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
we're going for two by eight and that's
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
two batteries and eight launch rocket
 
02:11:38.209 --> 02:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
launches so here's one of those
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
resolutions that we that that was
 
02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
supported by the state of New Hampshire
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm also working with the action
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
General with some other initiatives but
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
here's a prime example of some of the
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
stuff that we do and finally the last
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
page of course is covid
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
and as you well know and that's the
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
beauty about people like uh
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
former Governor Shaheen because they are
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
the commander-in-chief of your New
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire militia right the this this
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
thing called the Army and Air National
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
Guard goes all the way back right John
 
02:12:13.729 --> 02:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
Stark Live Free or Die death is not the
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
greatest of evils right this goes this
 
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
goes all the way back to forming the
 
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth in Massachusetts and all
 
02:12:23.209 --> 02:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
through the revolution this is your
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
ability this this National Guard
 
02:12:28.609 --> 02:12:28.619 align:start position:0%
Association was formed by in 1878 by
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
Civil War officers who were looking for
 
02:12:35.330 --> 02:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
benefits from the Carnage created by
 
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
that war and so that is what we do and
 
02:12:41.209 --> 02:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the National Guard is
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
one of those people that you can't
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
always call out right so you had you had
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
certain events where you just legally
 
02:12:50.569 --> 02:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
can't call out the guard but there's a
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff that you can and so when
 
02:12:54.890 --> 02:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
your citizens our citizens call for Need
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
for either the ice storm or floods or
 
02:12:59.810 --> 02:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
any of those they go on what's called
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
title 32 which is State active duty and
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
there commander-in-chief is your
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
Governor he or she commands those forces
 
02:13:09.649 --> 02:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
under General
 
02:13:12.410 --> 02:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
ities and then when we go up on the big
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
Wars Global Shield I've flown all that
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
stuff right I've I've been part of all
 
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
that stuff for all those many years I'm
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
on active duty
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
title 10 USC United States service code
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
and so this is what we try to do we try
 
02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
to get this National Guard ready for
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
both of its very unique missions it can
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
be caught up onto active duty states of
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
emergency and during war and it can be
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
called by the state so so I thank you
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll end I'll end with one more
 
02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll end I'll end with one more
thing

02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't going to go down this
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
because it's emotional but I'm also a
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
member of the peas uh honor guard
 
02:13:56.209 --> 02:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
and you're right representative gagne we
 
02:13:58.850 --> 02:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
we do try to say thank you and we we
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
have spent a long time as a country uh
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting ourselves never well but better
 
02:14:07.790 --> 02:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
for the for what happened with the
 
02:14:10.310 --> 02:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
return of our Vietnam veterans one of
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
the most poignant moments literally of
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
my military career was as a member of
 
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
the honor guard and we were
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
together when you put a full Honor Guard
 
02:14:26.569 --> 02:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
together it's the firing party it's the
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
color guard it's the casket carry it's
 
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
the bugler and it's the OIC which
 
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
happened to be me that day and they had
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
recovered remains of a C-130 uh enlisted
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
member uh in a country over in that
 
02:14:42.169 --> 02:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
region of the world where we used to
 
02:14:42.179 --> 02:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
region of the world where we used to
fight

02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
fight
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
and it just so happened that Rolling
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
Thunder that day was accompanying so
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
what we do is we all practice so that it
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
looks professional then we kind of Mill
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
around for a while until we get uh
 
02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
notification that they're leaving the
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
funeral home on that particular day we
 
02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
didn't need notification because you
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
could hear rolling thunder come in for
 
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
all those who do or do not know these
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
are motorcycle riders mostly Harley
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
Riders and as we gathered in our
 
02:15:13.729 --> 02:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
respective positions I was standing
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
there on a sunny beautiful day it wasn't
 
02:15:20.089 --> 02:15:20.099 align:start position:0%
at Bosque on but it was and the flags
 
02:15:23.089 --> 02:15:23.099 align:start position:0%
were waving and I was reflecting on how
 
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
lucky I was to have a father who fought
 
02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
in World War II and also be
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
a member of the honor guard and be in a
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
country where we are allowed to honor
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
our fallen service members and just to
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
hear them come in and to be there that
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
day is an experience I will never forget
 
02:15:46.850 --> 02:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
so for those of you who have served I
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%

I know you're dealing on the federal
 
02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
side and this of course is state federal
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
and Veterans
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
um so if we needed to get a hold of uh
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Shaheen's office you might be a
 
02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
conduit for that possibly uh I actually
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
we do work with Congressional Delegation
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
I happen to know that evening that you
 
02:17:38.810 --> 02:17:38.820 align:start position:0%

those kind of connections with those
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
people and and we usually try to work
 
02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
with their staffers whenever as I say
 
02:17:57.169 --> 02:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
General mcliti says has his sights he's
 
02:17:59.629 --> 02:17:59.639 align:start position:0%

02:36:05.630 --> 02:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
that are enrolled to the VA up at White
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
River Junction for those veterans that
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
live up in the uh you know Hanover and
 
02:36:11.389 --> 02:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
Lebanon area up there where it's closer
 
02:36:13.849 --> 02:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
but we really is part of what we call
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
the North Market which includes Vermont
 
02:36:19.370 --> 02:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire really team up a lot
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
with White River to to provide care you
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
know they provide some levels of care
 
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
that we don't in Manchester so we work
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
work very very well with them
 
02:36:30.290 --> 02:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
um I say that because you know there's
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
still a um a gap of of those folks that
 
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
are not enrolled now that doesn't mean
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
everybody is eligible for for health
 
02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
care but you know of that other 35 to 40
 
02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
000 veterans many are and we have you
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
know an aggressive Outreach team that
 
02:36:47.929 --> 02:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
goes out and want to make sure that
 
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
veterans are
 
02:36:54.889 --> 02:36:54.899 align:start position:0%
aware of their benefits and that we have
 
02:36:57.530 --> 02:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
our doors open and if if uh you know we
 
02:36:59.330 --> 02:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
can serve them whether it be their
 
02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
health care or other things we want to
 
02:37:03.650 --> 02:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
know that we want them to know that that
 
02:37:06.290 --> 02:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
we are a resource to them and I'll say
 
02:37:07.610 --> 02:37:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know it's been really good we have
 
02:37:11.450 --> 02:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
an aggressive Outreach team and this
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
latest legislation of The Pact act which
 
02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
is probably some of the most robust
 
02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
legislation in in the last 30 years or
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
so has opened up eligibility for
 
02:37:24.110 --> 02:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
veterans uh especially you know exposed
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
to different uh toxic exposures burn
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
pits things like that that perhaps
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
aren't eligible in in the past and so
 
02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
we've really leveraged that to educate
 
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
veterans uh via you know town halls and
 
02:37:38.750 --> 02:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
our media to get them to come in and
 
02:37:40.610 --> 02:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
they've started coming in it was great I
 
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
did a a town hall back right before
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
Christmas and had uh you know oef oef
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
veterans uh from uh you know Iraq and
 
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan that had never stepped foot
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
into the EA and came to listen and and
 
02:37:57.889 --> 02:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
you know enrolled I think you know even
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
eight people that night who really had
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
never intended on on walking him before
 
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I always told them that
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
that you know you may not need that
 
02:38:07.490 --> 02:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
health care now but please you know
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're a resource and and being enrolled
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
and understanding those uh those
 
02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:14.220 align:start position:0%
benefits now it's a lot easier to do it
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
up front than when you find out when you
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
do need them and then we have to go you
 
02:38:19.130 --> 02:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
know through a lot of things with
 
02:38:22.130 --> 02:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
eligibility so you know we continue to
 
02:38:25.730 --> 02:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
um to move forward that I uh
 
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
when I when I opened town halls and and
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
speak to our new employees that come in
 
02:38:33.290 --> 02:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
the Manchester VA I've had my my mission
 
02:38:35.330 --> 02:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
statement or I call it my director's
 
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
intent from the time I was in the Army
 
02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:38.090 align:start position:0%
intent from the time I was in the Army
but

02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
I say what every day should look like
 
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
and for veterans you know I've got
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
veterans find it easy to get an
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
appointment when it works well for them
 
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
they enter our facility they're greeted
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
with dignity and respect and they leave
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
knowing they were well taken care of and
 
02:38:56.570 --> 02:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
then those veterans tell other tell
 
02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
other veterans to come get their care at
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
the Manchester VA and so you know as
 
02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
complexes hospitals are I tell them
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
everybody knew coming in whether it's a
 
02:39:07.969 --> 02:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
physician you know front line staff
 
02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
whoever it is
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you keep that in your mind and try to
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
live up to that and make that happen
 
02:39:16.849 --> 02:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
each and every day everything else will
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
fall into place and so that's you know
 
02:39:21.410 --> 02:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
really my my vision for for a veteran
 
02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
then likewise for staff
 
02:39:26.330 --> 02:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
I say you know but every day what I want
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
staff to have every day look like is you
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
know Manchester VA employees can't wait
 
02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
to come to work because they believe in
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
our mission they feel valued they're
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
part of a team and they get to do
 
02:39:37.969 --> 02:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
Innovative things outside their normal
 
02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
job description and so again you know we
 
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
have a lot of other ways that veterans
 
02:39:45.770 --> 02:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
are for that staff are able to uh to get
 
02:39:48.349 --> 02:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
involved in the hospital and that's what
 
02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
keeps them fresh and keeps them you know
 
02:39:52.309 --> 02:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
wanting to work there so I just I wanted
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
to say that because that's kind of what
 
02:39:55.250 --> 02:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
drives me in the morning and when I get
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
down to to Really my uh
 
02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
um uh you know that intent it just kind
 
02:40:03.050 --> 02:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
of drives drives everything else
 
02:40:05.809 --> 02:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
going back to so our array of facilities
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
so we certainly have the main facility
 
02:40:10.250 --> 02:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
in in Manchester
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
an aging facility we are not a
 
02:40:15.290 --> 02:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
full-service hospital we do have
 
02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
inpatient care for long-term care
 
02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
patients we have 41 beds with a census
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
of 11 uh right right now
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
but you know our primary services are
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
certainly a focus on Primary Care Mental
 
02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
Health Suicide Prevention we have a
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
number of different Medical Specialties
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
and have been growing a lot over the
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
last couple years to include you know
 
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
Cardiology endocrinology and a lot of
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
those Medical Specialties we have a big
 
02:40:48.050 --> 02:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
focus on pain management uh in keeping
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
veterans off opioids as part of their
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
their uh their pain programs we have a
 
02:40:54.969 --> 02:40:54.979 align:start position:0%
growing surgical program
 
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
with three operating rooms and a
 
02:41:00.050 --> 02:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
procedure room albeit although I will
 
02:41:02.270 --> 02:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
say that if folks have watched the news
 
02:41:04.730 --> 02:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
we had an unfortunate pipe break the
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
weekend of Thanksgiving which I'm
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
navigating my way through here now and
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I think it'll be we're targeting
 
02:41:15.410 --> 02:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
mid-april of getting the or back open
 
02:41:17.690 --> 02:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
we've got some some water mitigation and
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
things we need to do
 
02:41:22.490 --> 02:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
um but I'll say is I think a credit to
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
our staff even after that pipe break
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
which took out three uh floors of the
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
hospital which is you know it's tough
 
02:41:32.270 --> 02:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
out of seven to eight hundred
 
02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
appointments that we do daily in there
 
02:41:38.809 --> 02:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
even that Monday we did just over 600
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
and we were very fortunate to be able to
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
take every nook and cranny and clinical
 
02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
area and move those places that were
 
02:41:47.809 --> 02:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
impacted into those so
 
02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
um but the surgical uh Suite um you know
 
02:41:53.929 --> 02:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
is tough so we've been shifting Folks up
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
to White River Junction our sister
 
02:41:58.370 --> 02:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
facility for surgeries and we also were
 
02:42:01.550 --> 02:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
in negotiations right now with um uh
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
local private sector hospitals like we
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
had done before four or five years ago
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
to have agreements for or space and it's
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
in my interest to actually keep those
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
agreements going even after crisis
 
02:42:16.610 --> 02:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
because with aging infrastructure I
 
02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
think you never know when you need to
 
02:42:20.270 --> 02:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
Pivot from a continuity of operations
 
02:42:22.610 --> 02:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
standpoint and we all rely on each other
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
and and we certainly have during the
 
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
pandemic both us using the private
 
02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
sector and them actually using uh and
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
asking us for for personnel help so I
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
would say the relationships are good in
 
02:42:35.630 --> 02:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
the community of us us work talking
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
together we certainly have a big rehab
 
02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
service and and a focus on on Whole
 
02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:43.070 align:start position:0%
service and and a focus on on Whole
Health

02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
Health
 
02:42:45.650 --> 02:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
so that's you know in in the main in the
 
02:42:48.889 --> 02:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
main campus there we do have four
 
02:42:51.650 --> 02:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
outlying community-based outpatient
 
02:42:53.929 --> 02:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
clinics uh we have two over in the
 
02:42:56.210 --> 02:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
Seacoast one that's
 
02:42:59.929 --> 02:42:59.939 align:start position:0%
um uh nested with the Medical Group over
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the uh the air refueling wing on on
 
02:43:05.270 --> 02:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
peas and so we're in their their medical
 
02:43:07.429 --> 02:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
group and we've got a a small Clinic
 
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
over there and then we've got one of the
 
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
newer facilities up in Somersworth about
 
02:43:15.770 --> 02:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
10 miles away uh uh when each of those
 
02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
clinics has about 2500 veterans assigned
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
to them in the in the Seacoast area
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
then we have two clinics up north we've
 
02:43:26.750 --> 02:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
got one north of here in Tilton uh where
 
02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
got one north of here in Tilton uh where
we

02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:29.830 align:start position:0%
we
offer

02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
offer
 
02:43:32.510 --> 02:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
primary care and mental health and
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
certainly actually work with with Kim
 
02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
here too at the state veterans home then
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have a a clinic up in Conway uh for
 
02:43:41.330 --> 02:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
in the in the Mount Washington Valley
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
each of those community-based outpatient
 
02:43:47.809 --> 02:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
clinics certainly a focus on Primary
 
02:43:49.849 --> 02:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
Care Mental Health we have social work
 
02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
embedded in there
 
02:43:55.270 --> 02:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
um uh we one of our strategic objectives
 
02:43:59.809 --> 02:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
is having medical Specialty Care go out
 
02:44:02.330 --> 02:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
to these remote clinics instead of
 
02:44:04.849 --> 02:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
having Manchester be the epicenter for
 
02:44:06.650 --> 02:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
for everything you know it's tough in
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
Conway in the middle of the winter time
 
02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
for somebody to come down you know
 
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
possibly for an appointment so we've had
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
our Specialists going out to those
 
02:44:18.889 --> 02:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
clinics and we also have a huge Reliance
 
02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
on Telehealth the VA actually Telehealth
 
02:44:24.849 --> 02:44:24.859 align:start position:0%
in in the country so each of those
 
02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
outline clinics has a Telehealth Hub
 
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
where you know perhaps somebody needs a
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
dermatology appointment and if it's
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh you know that veteran can
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
be at like that Conway clinic and speak
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
to our dermatologist and and uh and be
 
02:44:42.050 --> 02:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
seen uh without without coming down to
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
the to the main facility so uh the
 
02:44:46.610 --> 02:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
beauty of that in with the VA New
 
02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
England Health Care system is uh we not
 
02:44:53.389 --> 02:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
only have our own Specialists that help
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
augment that Hub we actually have all of
 
02:44:58.969 --> 02:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
New England so it's feasible that you
 
02:45:00.710 --> 02:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
know a veteran that might be up here in
 
02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
the Tilton Clinic is speaking to a
 
02:45:04.010 --> 02:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
nephrologist out of the VA in
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut so it's it's really really a
 
02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
powerful tool for us to be able to uh to
 
02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
provide access to care that's really
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
tough and some of those more more remote
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
areas even even on the outside
 
02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
so our strategic uh you know Direction
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
we continue to build a lot of
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure I'll say you know one
 
02:45:27.530 --> 02:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
main arm of ours is growing the
 
02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
workforce and personnel and it's
 
02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
certainly been tough over the last
 
02:45:32.570 --> 02:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
couple years a lot of people have left
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
health care and not just in the VA and
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
it makes it you know very difficult
 
02:45:40.550 --> 02:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
um you know for us so you know it's my
 
02:45:42.770 --> 02:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
job and the leadership to make sure that
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know we have competitive salaries
 
02:45:48.170 --> 02:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
we're able to uh I'll say you know
 
02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
compete with the private sector but also
 
02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
just make it attractive so you know
 
02:45:54.469 --> 02:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
things like we've done student loan
 
02:45:56.809 --> 02:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
repayment not only for recruiting but
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
even retaining staff that are that are
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
there a number of of salary surveys that
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
go up to Washington that we look at and
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:46:08.270 --> 02:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
um to compete you know with the private
 
02:46:10.010 --> 02:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
sector and and things have gone pretty
 
02:46:11.450 --> 02:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
you know pretty well
 
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I think for us it's it's being able
 
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
um continue getting the word out and
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
recruiting and having people come in but
 
02:46:22.130 --> 02:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
I think that the best thing that I've
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
seen you know the va's it's it's it's
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
different you know providing care in the
 
02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
VA you know we have a lot of other
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
extender programs and I find that that
 
02:46:34.610 --> 02:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
when um when staff come in uh the
 
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
relationship they have with veterans
 
02:46:37.969 --> 02:46:37.979 align:start position:0%
it's really that calling that I talked
 
02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
about that they enjoy you know
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine in that environment
 
02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
and veterans are just very thankful you
 
02:46:46.670 --> 02:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
know for for the care that they get so
 
02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
certainly working with uh uh you know
 
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
growing the workforce and and
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
professional development from within the
 
02:46:57.530 --> 02:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
other thing is expansion of services so
 
02:46:59.929 --> 02:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with the mission act
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know veterans have a choice of
 
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
getting their care in in the VA or out
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
in in the community and I think that's a
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
good thing I mean I'm a veteran and I
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
like to have choice too but I mean we
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
really think you know we provide
 
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
veteran-centric care and uh and I'll say
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
it is easier providing all of that here
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
than having it fragmented throughout the
 
02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
community so where we can build Services
 
02:47:26.090 --> 02:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to do you know
 
02:47:27.950 --> 02:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
everything's in the medical record and
 
02:47:31.490 --> 02:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and um and you know it's it's
 
02:47:34.190 --> 02:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
easier for the veterans we've added you
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
know surgical Services over the last
 
02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
year like ear nose and throat we've had
 
02:47:40.190 --> 02:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease more Cardiology
 
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
and and it's been growing and so it's
 
02:47:44.809 --> 02:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
really wonderful for uh for veterans to
 
02:47:48.170 --> 02:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
have access to those to those services
 
02:47:50.330 --> 02:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
the last piece for you know for
 
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
strategic direction is just my eye on
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
infrastructure you know we've got a 70
 
02:47:59.330 --> 02:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
year old campus that you know I I don't
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
want to worry about whether we're going
 
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
to have another pipe like you know or
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
things and and so we work with with the
 
02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
VA to have an aggressive Capital
 
02:48:10.849 --> 02:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
Improvement program in in place but you
 
02:48:12.530 --> 02:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
know it takes time to build new
 
02:48:15.050 --> 02:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in new buildings but you
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
know we are committed to um
 
02:48:19.730 --> 02:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
um you know continuing to work on this
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so this past January we
 
02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
had a new urgent care and mental health
 
02:48:26.690 --> 02:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
Annex that was built at the Manchester
 
02:48:29.630 --> 02:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
VA you know Wonderful facility we have a
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
new Specialty Service Annex that will be
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
breaking ground on uh you know next year
 
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
we have a Women's Health Clinic uh to
 
02:48:40.429 --> 02:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
serve our women veterans that's private
 
02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
with private entrances uh and uh and
 
02:48:45.889 --> 02:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
that's a a project that's upcoming will
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
probably break ground in late 23 or
 
02:48:49.809 --> 02:48:49.819 align:start position:0%
early 24
 
02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
many infrastructure projects that aren't
 
02:48:54.830 --> 02:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'll say is appealing to the to the eye
 
02:48:57.950 --> 02:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
but you know the uh the infrastructure
 
02:48:59.690 --> 02:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
for utilities and all you know all that
 
02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
stuff has to be upgraded you can't run
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
any hospital with you know 70 year old
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
utilities and things so there's a
 
02:49:07.610 --> 02:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on with that that
 
02:49:09.349 --> 02:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
we're building
 
02:49:10.610 --> 02:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure whether folks had
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have this Franklin campus
 
02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
02:49:16.969 --> 02:49:16.979 align:start position:0%
um uh going to be a veteran campus here
 
02:49:19.010 --> 02:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that Governor sununu
 
02:49:21.650 --> 02:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
had spearheaded in to the VA so one of
 
02:49:23.450 --> 02:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
the things we're looking at is taking
 
02:49:26.929 --> 02:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
this Tilton Clinic that we have and
 
02:49:28.969 --> 02:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
looking to be able to expand and I say
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
how nice would that be to have something
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
nested with other veteran organizations
 
02:49:35.929 --> 02:49:35.939 align:start position:0%
you know on that campus that comes to
 
02:49:37.610 --> 02:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
fruition so that's one thing that we're
 
02:49:40.190 --> 02:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
we're speaking about now to to continue
 
02:49:43.309 --> 02:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
building that that infrastructure as
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
well as the other the other clinics
 
02:49:49.730 --> 02:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
so um you know a lot lots going on but
 
02:49:51.050 --> 02:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
certainly the eye in on on
 
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and uh and really kind of
 
02:49:57.770 --> 02:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
driving us into uh the 21st century here
 
02:50:00.830 --> 02:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide services that the
 
02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
last the last piece that I'll
 
02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:05.939 align:start position:0%
I'll mention here because I'm you know
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm very
 
02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
um mindful of not having a full-service
 
02:50:13.309 --> 02:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
hospital here in New Hampshire and so
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know a lot goes into that but you
 
02:50:17.929 --> 02:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
know we have relationships with our no
 
02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
the VA down in Boston you know a 1A
 
02:50:23.929 --> 02:50:23.939 align:start position:0%
complex tertiary Care Facility the VA in
 
02:50:26.270 --> 02:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
up in White River but also have
 
02:50:28.130 --> 02:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
wonderful relationships with the
 
02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
facilities in in Manchester
 
02:50:32.030 --> 02:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you know whether it be Catholic
 
02:50:34.730 --> 02:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
Medical Center the Elliott and and um
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
even you know Concord Hospital and so
 
02:50:38.809 --> 02:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
what we've done and this is just
 
02:50:40.849 --> 02:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
starting in in uh you know another month
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
or so here but we've built an inpatient
 
02:50:46.969 --> 02:50:46.979 align:start position:0%
embedded case management team and so
 
02:50:49.490 --> 02:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
this consists of nursing staff and
 
02:50:51.410 --> 02:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
social work staff that will physically
 
02:50:54.889 --> 02:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
be in those private sector hospitals so
 
02:50:57.770 --> 02:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
that when you know the uh the impatient
 
02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
team that rounds on on our veterans the
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
VA will be side by side with them
 
02:51:04.969 --> 02:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
rounding in those hospitals so the
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
veterans know that the VA is right there
 
02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know with the medical team taking
 
02:51:11.450 --> 02:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
care of them and that we're able to do a
 
02:51:12.889 --> 02:51:12.899 align:start position:0%
smooth transition when it's time to
 
02:51:15.610 --> 02:51:15.620 align:start position:0%
discharge and get that you know after uh
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
inpatient care
 
02:51:19.969 --> 02:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
that we're able to facilitate right
 
02:51:22.550 --> 02:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
there we make it much easier for that
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
hospital and in much easier for us to be
 
02:51:26.450 --> 02:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
able to get them the appointments they
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
need and really have a smooth transition
 
02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
back for that post discharge care so I'm
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
excited about that we haven't done that
 
02:51:36.530 --> 02:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh previously and so that's our I think
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
our first foray and to get it you know
 
02:51:41.450 --> 02:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
having a physical presence in in the
 
02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
hospitals there so
 
02:51:45.050 --> 02:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of where we're going
 
02:51:47.090 --> 02:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the the challenges it's
 
02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's exciting
 
02:51:50.210 --> 02:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
um you know the pack tax certainly I
 
02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:52.979 align:start position:0%
look forward to to more veterans you
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
know uh using our services and and uh
 
02:51:57.410 --> 02:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know would ask for all of you that
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that you know hopefully that helps give
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
you an idea of what we provide and I'd
 
02:52:03.469 --> 02:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
ask that you know if you know of a
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
veteran in need is please refer them you
 
02:52:07.309 --> 02:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
know our way and if we can't help them
 
02:52:09.290 --> 02:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
we certainly will get them to the right
 
02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
resource that uh that can so
 
02:52:14.809 --> 02:52:14.819 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question the match to VA are
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
they still dealing with agent orange
 
02:53:01.969 --> 02:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
intakes yes as part of pectech we have
 
02:53:03.950 --> 02:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
the the registry they come in and go to
 
02:53:06.110 --> 02:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
our administrative medicine clinic get
 
02:53:07.969 --> 02:53:07.979 align:start position:0%
on that registry and whatever you know
 
02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
physicals are appropriate so so where do
 
02:53:14.330 --> 02:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
they go from Manchester whether they go
 
02:53:16.370 --> 02:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
from Manchester yeah
 
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
if surgery is required do they are they
 
02:53:23.570 --> 02:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
sent to was it Roxbury they may go to
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
West Roxbury they might go to White
 
02:53:27.170 --> 02:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
River Junction we may use the community
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know depending each patient case
 
02:53:32.210 --> 02:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
would be individual on what those needs
 
02:53:34.610 --> 02:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
are thank you thank you
 
02:53:36.469 --> 02:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins
 
02:53:38.210 --> 02:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question what is the financial
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
threshold to be eligible to be to go to
 
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
02:53:47.570 --> 02:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
so is there a threshold or how much
 
02:53:50.809 --> 02:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
money you can make or not make or well
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
there is and it's individual per each
 
02:53:55.550 --> 02:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
person you know the the eligibility it
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
starts with service connection and a
 
02:54:00.290 --> 02:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
disability rating is a big part of the
 
02:54:02.269 --> 02:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility piece so you know anybody
 
02:54:04.429 --> 02:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
that's service connected uh certainly
 
02:54:06.490 --> 02:54:06.500 align:start position:0%
can be seen for those service connected
 
02:54:09.889 --> 02:54:09.899 align:start position:0%
conditions anybody over 50 percent
 
02:54:12.889 --> 02:54:12.899 align:start position:0%
service connected is able to get their
 
02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
you know their full care there
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
um short of the service connection piece
 
02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
it does go on a tiered schedule based on
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
income possible service connection and
 
02:54:26.750 --> 02:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
um um and they look at each person
 
02:54:28.610 --> 02:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
individually with that so it kind of
 
02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
depends on that but thank you okay
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:42.769 --> 02:54:42.779 align:start position:0%

02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
Veteran or commandant I think is a
 
02:56:38.269 --> 02:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
proper term you can correct us on that
 
02:56:40.969 --> 02:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
at the uh at our wonderful Veterans Home
 
02:56:43.130 --> 02:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
in Tilton
 
02:56:46.610 --> 02:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
yes another big title big title right
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for having me I'm Kim
 
02:56:50.990 --> 02:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
McKay I'm the commandant of the New
 
02:56:52.730 --> 02:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans home
 
02:56:54.590 --> 02:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
um have been there just this month I
 
02:56:57.469 --> 02:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
will be finishing my first year so I
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
love coming out and being able to brag
 
02:57:00.530 --> 02:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
about the facility
 
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
I did throw together a handout
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
um just to go through I don't know is it
 
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
does everybody know about the New
 
02:57:08.809 --> 02:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Veterans Home
 
02:57:12.290 --> 02:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
yes no okay
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so in 1890 it was created as and it's
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
still sometimes called the Tilton
 
02:57:19.070 --> 02:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
Soldiers Home a lot of people will call
 
02:57:20.210 --> 02:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
it that
 
02:57:24.050 --> 02:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
um but it's right now it is a 250 bed
 
02:57:27.730 --> 02:57:27.740 align:start position:0%
facility we have licensing for 250
 
02:57:30.410 --> 02:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
Intermediate Care which means long-term
 
02:57:33.290 --> 02:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
care not skilled so we don't do rehab we
 
02:57:36.110 --> 02:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
just do long-term care so we're we have
 
02:57:38.690 --> 02:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
250 bids the license the state of New
 
02:57:41.090 --> 02:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the governor the governor
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
budgets us at 225 so we have a budget
 
02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
for 225.
 
02:57:48.950 --> 02:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
um but the real reality of
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
um Staffing as Kevin had mentioned is
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we cannot provide the services at
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
225 with the limited staff we have so we
 
02:57:59.090 --> 02:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
have uh set a cap right now currently
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
and that changes constantly if we have
 
02:58:02.809 --> 02:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
more staff we can take more residents
 
02:58:06.290 --> 02:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
but we're we're capping at like 131
 
02:58:10.610 --> 02:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
right now so unfortunately uh that's one
 
02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
of our challenges you'll hear me talk a
 
02:58:15.650 --> 02:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
little bit further down but about uh 50
 
02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
or a half of them right now we have
 
02:58:20.929 --> 02:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
about 50 residents on our dementia care
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
units and the rest live in our tar South
 
02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh mission statements is to provide the
 
02:58:35.450 --> 02:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
best quality of life for the New
 
02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterans with dignity honor
 
02:58:40.250 --> 02:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
and respect and I think if you uh ever
 
02:58:41.450 --> 02:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
have a chance
 
02:58:43.490 --> 02:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you could call me see if we are open
 
02:58:46.010 --> 02:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
at this point uh we have opened our
 
02:58:48.410 --> 02:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
doors and then covid comes and then we
 
02:58:49.730 --> 02:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
have to close them again and
 
02:58:51.469 --> 02:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately right now we're on a
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
restricted uh visits for a couple of our
 
02:58:56.090 --> 02:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
units because we do have active covid
 
02:58:58.250 --> 02:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
and we are an outbreak break status but
 
02:59:00.170 --> 02:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
if there's a ton that you would like to
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
come I would ask you to come and and
 
02:59:04.849 --> 02:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
just get the feel of the facility you
 
02:59:06.889 --> 02:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
will see how appreciative the residents
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
the veterans are and how much the staff
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
loves doing the work they're doing I
 
02:59:13.490 --> 02:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
think if you do this type of work in the
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
medical field and you work with the
 
02:59:18.769 --> 02:59:18.779 align:start position:0%
veterans you you love the work that you
 
02:59:21.290 --> 02:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
do it's not just about the paycheck we
 
02:59:22.730 --> 02:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
have staff that have been there for
 
02:59:22.740 --> 02:59:23.590 align:start position:0%
have staff that have been there for
years

02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:59:26.750 --> 02:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
and they become our family the veterans
 
02:59:28.610 --> 02:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
become our family
 
02:59:32.570 --> 02:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
so our current census right now is 127.
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
as I said we go up to 131 and that
 
02:59:37.790 --> 02:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
changes depending on when we can do
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
admissions or if someone's passed we
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
have 117 men 10 women and our our
 
02:59:49.010 --> 02:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
average age right now is about 84. so uh
 
02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
that has been staying consistent since
 
02:59:55.130 --> 02:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:57.230 --> 02:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
branch of military so for the people
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
that have served this is always a
 
03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
conversation especially around the card
 
03:00:04.610 --> 03:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
table because how many marines does it
 
03:00:07.130 --> 03:00:07.140 align:start position:0%
take how many of this how many that and
 
03:00:09.469 --> 03:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh who's better who's not uh so I
 
03:00:11.030 --> 03:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
whenever I do a presentation I like to
 
03:00:12.530 --> 03:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
just give the breakdown of our current
 
03:00:15.769 --> 03:00:15.779 align:start position:0%
population so right now we have 27
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
residents in the air that had certain
 
03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
Air Force One in the air guy uh guard
 
03:00:23.269 --> 03:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
most of our residents are army right now
 
03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
54 residents one Coast Guard what she
 
03:00:29.450 --> 03:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
gets a lot of uh ribbon about that not
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
being real
 
03:00:32.809 --> 03:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
um I feel bad for him because he has no
 
03:00:35.929 --> 03:00:35.939 align:start position:0%
no allies with him uh three Marines
 
03:00:38.090 --> 03:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
which uh one of the
 
03:00:41.570 --> 03:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
um Council executive Council says that's
 
03:00:44.889 --> 03:00:44.899 align:start position:0%
good that's that's a good no and uh 41
 
03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
Navy we do have a couple of residents
 
03:00:49.610 --> 03:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
who actually have served in multiple
 
03:00:49.620 --> 03:00:50.929 align:start position:0%
who actually have served in multiple
branches

03:00:50.929 --> 03:00:50.939 align:start position:0%
branches
 
03:00:52.969 --> 03:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
um so they they it's interesting who
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
they'll say they identify as though so
 
03:00:58.370 --> 03:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
um and then I always try to uh just talk
 
03:01:00.830 --> 03:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
about the conflict era we're seeing the
 
03:01:04.730 --> 03:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
World War II veterans fade very quickly
 
03:01:07.010 --> 03:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
um the last time I did the data for this
 
03:01:10.969 --> 03:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
was uh for a presentation probably about
 
03:01:14.090 --> 03:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
three months ago and we had 17 World War
 
03:01:16.370 --> 03:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
II veterans and so when I did it this
 
03:01:18.889 --> 03:01:18.899 align:start position:0%
week and I saw that it was 14. it's just
 
03:01:21.370 --> 03:01:21.380 align:start position:0%
really sad to see that era
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
passing uh Korean conflict 40 residents
 
03:01:29.090 --> 03:01:29.100 align:start position:0%
and a Vietnam era we have 64 and then we
 
03:01:30.410 --> 03:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
have nine residents who served during
 
03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:31.730 align:start position:0%
have nine residents who served during
peacetime

03:01:31.730 --> 03:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
peacetime
 
03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:32.990 align:start position:0%
peacetime
so

03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:36.170 --> 03:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
um just a kind of just a snapshot of our
 
03:01:38.269 --> 03:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
resident population
 
03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
I also put in here some challenges and
 
03:01:42.349 --> 03:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
achievements so
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
um with every uh challenge we have we
 
03:01:48.830 --> 03:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
try to create a solution and these two
 
03:01:51.950 --> 03:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
challenges are very related so a
 
03:01:53.389 --> 03:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
challenge has been Recruitment and
 
03:01:55.969 --> 03:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
Retention of Staff both clinically and
 
03:01:58.969 --> 03:01:58.979 align:start position:0%
non-clinically in the state system in
 
03:02:01.849 --> 03:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
the past you would uh you would never
 
03:02:04.910 --> 03:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
have an opening in a maintenance or a
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
dietary or Food Service people would
 
03:02:09.290 --> 03:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
take part-time jobs to come in to get
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
their foot in the door to be wait for a
 
03:02:13.969 --> 03:02:13.979 align:start position:0%
full-time job and we don't see that
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
anymore we're not we're just not seeing
 
03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
that we have vacancy rates of about 34
 
03:02:22.250 --> 03:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
percent and our nursing vacancy rates
 
03:02:25.010 --> 03:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
about 48 percent and which is why we
 
03:02:27.010 --> 03:02:27.020 align:start position:0%
can't go to the full
 
03:02:29.690 --> 03:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
225 but we're also right now
 
03:02:32.210 --> 03:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
experiencing a huge shortage in our food
 
03:02:35.150 --> 03:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
service area and that is because we pay
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
as a state so low compared to what they
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
can make in the community so in this in
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
a in our facility if you're making to
 
03:02:45.469 --> 03:02:45.479 align:start position:0%
twelve dollars and sixty cents an hour
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
and you have to know somebody's diet
 
03:02:50.990 --> 03:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
their allergies the consistency of their
 
03:02:53.630 --> 03:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
food there's a lot of pieces of that or
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
I can go to McDonald's and make 15 an
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
hour and I can make a burger make a
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
burger make one without ketchup make a
 
03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
burger make a burger it's just a lot
 
03:03:04.429 --> 03:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
less responsibility so we're seeing
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
these these hardships in all of our
 
03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
areas and of course as Kevin had
 
03:03:11.809 --> 03:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're feeling it in the
 
03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
nursing field we've been feeling it for
 
03:03:15.650 --> 03:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
a while there so some of the things we
 
03:03:18.170 --> 03:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
did we launched a licensed nursing
 
03:03:21.410 --> 03:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
assistant program our we have staff uh
 
03:03:24.170 --> 03:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
that that actually teach the program and
 
03:03:26.570 --> 03:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
so we've created part-time positions and
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
we hire the potential student and they
 
03:03:33.290 --> 03:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
come on as an LNA trainee and then they
 
03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
work for us and they get learn as you
 
03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
learn they take the class us on site
 
03:03:41.690 --> 03:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
with our residents and they're getting
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
paid as an employee and then they take
 
03:03:46.370 --> 03:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
the exam and then they go into a
 
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
full-time position we're about ready to
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
graduate our third group of students and
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
that will be 16 new lnas just in our
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
system in the last six months so that's
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
been or maybe eight months that's been a
 
03:04:05.450 --> 03:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
huge help because the lnas again a lot
 
03:04:07.250 --> 03:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
of facilities in the private sector are
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to offer sign-on bonuses we just
 
03:04:11.630 --> 03:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't have that option in the state
 
03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
system so we have to figure out a way to
 
03:04:17.330 --> 03:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
recruit people and then keep people so
 
03:04:19.610 --> 03:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
we want to retain them so creating a
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
ladder for Education we created a
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
medication nursing assistant program
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the Board of Nursing that just got
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
approved in December and so we can have
 
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
lnas who have been L A's for two years
 
03:04:33.769 --> 03:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
take this course in-house and then they
 
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
can also pass medications that don't
 
03:04:38.450 --> 03:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
require assessments under the the
 
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
supervision of a nurse
 
03:04:42.769 --> 03:04:42.779 align:start position:0%
we have reclassed a vacant position to
 
03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
focus on recruitment so we have a
 
03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
full-time recruiter just looking at how
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
to get out to job fairs how to get to
 
03:04:50.269 --> 03:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
high schools how to get
 
03:04:50.279 --> 03:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
high schools how to get
um

03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
our name anywhere we can we are on
 
03:04:56.929 --> 03:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
College boards you know hiring boards
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying a lot of different things
 
03:05:01.429 --> 03:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't tried in the past and
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're improving our onboarding and our
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
retention support So when someone comes
 
03:05:09.590 --> 03:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
on it's just it's important to keep them
 
03:05:12.050 --> 03:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
there but they need to feel like part of
 
03:05:13.370 --> 03:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
the team they need to feel like they're
 
03:05:15.530 --> 03:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
doing a good job so our orientation we
 
03:05:17.090 --> 03:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
really looked at that how do we do that
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
and that's really piecing people up
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
together as a team so if I have a
 
03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
question I have somebody go to if I
 
03:05:25.690 --> 03:05:25.700 align:start position:0%
don't know how to
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
approach this resident I have somebody
 
03:05:30.050 --> 03:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
to go to so they have a peer that
 
03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
they're connected with and then we've
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
been doing uh communication Improvement
 
03:05:36.590 --> 03:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
across the board when I came in a year
 
03:05:39.530 --> 03:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
ago not everybody had email which was
 
03:05:42.290 --> 03:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
just really surprising to me because I I
 
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
was so accustomed to having email and my
 
03:05:48.769 --> 03:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
third day there we had a covet outbreak
 
03:05:50.809 --> 03:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
and so I was saying let's push out the
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
email everybody needs to know so we're
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
all aware and what we're going to do so
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
I was surprised that only 50 of the
 
03:05:59.809 --> 03:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
staff had email it is a cost and but to
 
03:06:01.490 --> 03:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
me it felt like it was an important cost
 
03:06:04.849 --> 03:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
so we now have email for everybody it's
 
03:06:07.550 --> 03:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
not a hierarchy everybody needs the same
 
03:06:07.560 --> 03:06:08.650 align:start position:0%
not a hierarchy everybody needs the same
information

03:06:08.650 --> 03:06:08.660 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
we also have a lot more staff meetings I
 
03:06:15.410 --> 03:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
they they name everything at the
 
03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
veterans home so it's called
 
03:06:19.250 --> 03:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
conversations with the commandant so I
 
03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
meet with every staff member quarterly
 
03:06:24.050 --> 03:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
on every shift so I by the time I've
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
said the agenda the 14th time I'm kind
 
03:06:30.050 --> 03:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
of boring myself but for them at two in
 
03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
the morning they're happy that I'm on
 
03:06:33.050 --> 03:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
their shift to see them so we're seeing
 
03:06:36.290 --> 03:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of that kind of improvement and
 
03:06:36.300 --> 03:06:37.190 align:start position:0%
a lot of that kind of improvement and
then

03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:06:41.389 --> 03:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
I uh talk about the census
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and that it relates to Staffing we
 
03:06:46.849 --> 03:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
can't improve our census and meet the
 
03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
need of all the residents or all the
 
03:06:50.690 --> 03:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
veterans in the community and so we can
 
03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
actually increase our staffing so I have
 
03:06:56.090 --> 03:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's a twofold we need to increase our
 
03:06:59.450 --> 03:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
staffing to increase our census so we're
 
03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
trying to at least meet the needs of the
 
03:07:03.469 --> 03:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
people that we have there
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
um the residents are they expect a high
 
03:07:08.210 --> 03:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
quality of care the families expect a
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
high quality care and our staff want to
 
03:07:12.349 --> 03:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
give nothing but a high quality care so
 
03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
that's where we set that number we've
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
Consolidated units because we had units
 
03:07:19.130 --> 03:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
where they were half full and so we have
 
03:07:22.490 --> 03:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
them on all on the same unit to have our
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
staffing be able to meet the needs we've
 
03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
extended or expanded light duty return
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
work programs to keep the employees in
 
03:07:31.849 --> 03:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
the workplace if you can do something
 
03:07:33.650 --> 03:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
then maybe you can't do your original
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
job but maybe you can do something else
 
03:07:38.210 --> 03:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
in another area we have been doing that
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
um we have increased the number of
 
03:07:42.190 --> 03:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
volunteers we are very lucky we have 100
 
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
plus volunteers that come in on a
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
03:07:48.650 --> 03:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
um that help us out from folding laundry
 
03:07:51.050 --> 03:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
to waitressing in our dining rooms
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
because we're short staffed and then we
 
03:07:56.929 --> 03:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
mandate for nursing staff every nurse
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
and LNA does an extra four-hour Block in
 
03:08:03.170 --> 03:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
the two-week pay period so they have a
 
03:08:04.969 --> 03:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
little control over when that mandate is
 
03:08:07.010 --> 03:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
taking place but that helps us meet the
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.330 --> 03:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I put the next one in here is about
 
03:08:13.730 --> 03:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
revenue streams uh not many people know
 
03:08:17.210 --> 03:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
that we have three uh sources
 
03:08:19.610 --> 03:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
um two so the first biggest one is the
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
general fund we're about 47 uh funded by
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
the general fund the VA meaning that
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
their their benefits um through the per
 
03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
diem rate of uh VA payments is about 29
 
03:08:35.210 --> 03:08:35.220 align:start position:0%
and then private pay or room and board
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has thirty thousand
 
03:08:39.710 --> 03:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
dollars or more than uh over for income
 
03:08:42.590 --> 03:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
not their home but income uh and assets
 
03:08:44.690 --> 03:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
then they pay a higher rate until they
 
03:08:47.050 --> 03:08:47.060 align:start position:0%
hit that thirty thousand dollar less
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
and then in here I talk about Chris key
 
03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
strategic priorities again growing the
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
census when I we've gone about 10
 
03:08:58.550 --> 03:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
percent in the last year we are at 121
 
03:09:02.090 --> 03:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
now we're moving up to 131. meet the VA
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
survey requirements we're required to be
 
03:09:07.070 --> 03:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
surveyed every year by the VA they come
 
03:09:08.929 --> 03:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
in and and check us out it's our report
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
card and so I always look forward to it
 
03:09:12.769 --> 03:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
I know people get really nervous about
 
03:09:14.450 --> 03:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
it but I always think it's this is where
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
we can find out if we're doing a great
 
03:09:18.290 --> 03:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
job and we always hear you're doing a
 
03:09:19.790 --> 03:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
great job so
 
03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
um so that happens every April so we're
 
03:09:24.889 --> 03:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
looking forward to that uh health and
 
03:09:27.410 --> 03:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
life safety initiatives
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
um what can we do to ensure that our
 
03:09:32.929 --> 03:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
facility is safe for all that come in
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
all that live there and different
 
03:09:37.250 --> 03:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
um projects so we're always looking at
 
03:09:38.929 --> 03:09:38.939 align:start position:0%
projects people ask us what can they
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
help with and I think the gentleman back
 
03:09:43.490 --> 03:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
here was talking about our project of
 
03:09:46.010 --> 03:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
our in our dementia unit we're putting
 
03:09:48.769 --> 03:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
up these um they're almost like vinyl on
 
03:09:50.809 --> 03:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
our exit doors because a lot of the
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
veterans try to exit seek and so it
 
03:09:54.769 --> 03:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
looks like a bookcase so it doesn't look
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
like a door so we're and our partners
 
03:09:59.330 --> 03:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
our biggest support our veteran service
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
organizations and so they will ask us
 
03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
what do you need what could make this
 
03:10:05.809 --> 03:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
facility safer and we give these
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
projects out and then they fundraise for
 
03:10:10.250 --> 03:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
us we would not be as in such a great
 
03:10:12.050 --> 03:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
shape if we didn't have all the support
 
03:10:13.490 --> 03:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
from the community
 
03:10:15.889 --> 03:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
we have to increase our contracted
 
03:10:18.170 --> 03:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
Services we're trying to get uh
 
03:10:21.889 --> 03:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
temporary nurses a contract for we have
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
a contract currently it's not been
 
03:10:27.410 --> 03:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
producing any nurses so we need to try
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
to get a new contracted service and then
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
our it infrastructure is pretty poor the
 
03:10:36.290 --> 03:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
building's older so we just got a
 
03:10:40.849 --> 03:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
a grant through the Opera funds for 1.1
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars to update our Wi-Fi
 
03:10:47.570 --> 03:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
system I can't tell you how many uh 84
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
year olds are having they have their
 
03:10:51.170 --> 03:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
phone they're on their they're on like
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
Zoom meetings with their families in
 
03:10:55.070 --> 03:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
their rooms and so if it doesn't work
 
03:10:58.010 --> 03:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
well I hear about it so we definitely
 
03:11:00.050 --> 03:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
need to do a better job because the
 
03:11:02.210 --> 03:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
building is so old so it's hard for the
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi to work well so we're going to be
 
03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Kim that's a great brief very
 
03:11:16.429 --> 03:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
nice PowerPoint very military power
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
I see you only have three Marines there
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's the good news it's enough to change
 
03:11:22.250 --> 03:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
the light bulb though right uh see
 
03:11:23.570 --> 03:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's I wasn't going to say the joke
 
03:11:25.730 --> 03:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
but that's what I hear if any of those
 
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
three Marines give you trouble uh let
 
03:11:29.929 --> 03:11:29.939 align:start position:0%
Joe Kenny know and he will take
 
03:11:32.750 --> 03:11:32.760 align:start position:0%

Community Corrections there

03:12:19.550 --> 03:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
other questions uh yes there wasn't a
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
short left
 
03:12:22.969 --> 03:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
being here and uh I should declare a
 
03:12:27.170 --> 03:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
conflict because they may be a resident
 
03:12:29.929 --> 03:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
there someday and uh but my question is
 
03:12:32.450 --> 03:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
the common Den is there anything that we
 
03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
in the legislature can do to help with
 
03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
some of your challenges and notice for
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
example you talked about vehicle
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
replacement and upgrade
 
03:12:44.450 --> 03:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I know this is a budget year as well
 
03:12:48.290 --> 03:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
and um if you need any help I guess I
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
can speak for myself personally but any
 
03:12:52.849 --> 03:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
help as far as your budget to testify or
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
to uh work in this body to try to give
 
03:12:58.550 --> 03:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
you the budget that you actually need to
 
03:13:00.769 --> 03:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
perform your duties I think that's
 
03:13:03.130 --> 03:13:03.140 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon all of us though
 
03:13:06.010 --> 03:13:06.020 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that yes we are trying to
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
refund or uh there were unfunded
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
positions we've asked for those to be
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
refunded uh we do have older uh Vans and
 
03:13:18.290 --> 03:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
our residents um there's uh all the
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
activities they do comes out of the
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
resident benefit fund that's all
 
03:13:23.450 --> 03:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
donations from the community all
 
03:13:23.460 --> 03:13:24.830 align:start position:0%
donations from the community all
donations

03:13:24.830 --> 03:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
donations
 
03:13:26.929 --> 03:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
um and they're very active they do a lot
 
03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
of activities uh which requires a bus
 
03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
with a wheelchair lift so our buses are
 
03:13:33.170 --> 03:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
old so that is in the budget for this
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
year to the next two years to replace
 
03:13:37.910 --> 03:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
our budgets I mean our buses but I will
 
03:13:39.170 --> 03:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
say that
 
03:13:41.870 --> 03:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
I really would love to see some kind of
 
03:13:44.269 --> 03:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
educational program an incentive program
 
03:13:46.610 --> 03:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
similar to what uh Kevin is talking
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
about we have to keep uh the staff there
 
03:13:51.830 --> 03:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
so I would love to see us be able to
 
03:13:56.690 --> 03:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
sponsor Stu staff so two lnas to become
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
LPNs licensed practical nurses two LPNs
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
to become RNs invest in the staff that
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have and say you know we are
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
appreciative that you're here we know
 
03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
that you're committed to these veterans
 
03:14:12.530 --> 03:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
and the cost is minimal at when I say
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
minimal and the big picture of things
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's twenty five thousand dollars for a
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
bridging program and it's a one-year
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
commitment so for if we sponsored four
 
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
people for one hundred thousand dollars
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
that would be amazing to have those
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
staff um stay with us and then we'd ask
 
03:14:30.830 --> 03:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
for a commitment we can't you know hold
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
them to that but we would ask them for a
 
03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
commitment for two years after their
 
03:14:34.020 --> 03:14:36.790 align:start position:0%
commitment for two years after their
education

03:14:36.790 --> 03:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:39.130 --> 03:14:39.140 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
Judy yes thank you Mr chair uh ma'am on
 
03:14:47.809 --> 03:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
your presentation I feel you are really
 
03:14:50.290 --> 03:14:50.300 align:start position:0%
care about your vision
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
keep going don't give up thank you and
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
also uh did you uh
 
03:15:01.750 --> 03:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
you do have a
 
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 there on one of the
 
03:15:08.450 --> 03:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
one of the virgins yes right now we have
 
03:15:10.010 --> 03:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
um we have covid we're in an outbreak
 
03:15:11.990 --> 03:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
status we've had
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
um about uh 19 staff and we have seven
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
um veterans
 
03:15:20.450 --> 03:15:20.460 align:start position:0%
um actually they just sent me an email
 
03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
there's two more so nine veterans with
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
active covid
 
03:15:27.050 --> 03:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
um this is the fourth outbreak since
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
I've been there in a year uh the one
 
03:15:31.370 --> 03:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
thing I will say is that the outbreaks
 
03:15:32.510 --> 03:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
are smaller
 
03:15:35.210 --> 03:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
shorter duration because we're able to
 
03:15:37.450 --> 03:15:37.460 align:start position:0%
identify that the residents right away
 
03:15:40.849 --> 03:15:40.859 align:start position:0%
and because we have there many of them
 
03:15:43.309 --> 03:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
or most of them are vaccinated and we
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
use the medications that are available
 
03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
we have not had any deaths so I knock on
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
wood I ask for everybody's prayers to
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
keep that going but yes we do have it
 
03:15:56.690 --> 03:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
and then it will go off and then we go
 
03:15:58.250 --> 03:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
back on it depends on what's in the
 
03:16:02.269 --> 03:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
community yes thank you
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
okay to finish up a couple quick
 
03:16:07.130 --> 03:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
questions uh your oldest resident and
 
03:16:10.490 --> 03:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
also the typical uh period of time that
 
03:16:13.010 --> 03:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
someone stays there uh oldest resident
 
03:16:16.250 --> 03:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
is a hundred so we do have a 100 year
 
03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
old resident and we have someone in the
 
03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
90s that are just right on the cusp
 
03:16:23.450 --> 03:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I would say it's it really is so
 
03:16:25.309 --> 03:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
fluid because it depends on when they
 
03:16:27.130 --> 03:16:27.140 align:start position:0%
come in if you come in at 90 something
 
03:16:29.330 --> 03:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
your stay is going to be shorter than if
 
03:16:31.610 --> 03:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
you come in at 70. but
 
03:16:31.620 --> 03:16:32.210 align:start position:0%
you come in at 70. but
um

03:16:32.210 --> 03:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:35.090 --> 03:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
I would say a year or two you know we
 
03:16:36.410 --> 03:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
have residents right now that have been
 
03:16:38.269 --> 03:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
there for nine years and then some that
 
03:16:40.809 --> 03:16:40.819 align:start position:0%
just came in
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
you might have touched on this but the
 
03:16:46.010 --> 03:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh the youngest how old you have to be
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
to to be able to be eligible to to stay
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
there right it's not really an age it's
 
03:16:54.769 --> 03:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
a medical need so you have to meet the
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
need to be in a long-term care setting
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so we don't have an age I think our
 
03:17:02.450 --> 03:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
youngest person is in their late 60s
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
right now but we look at your medical
 
03:17:06.410 --> 03:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
condition so it's not really an age
 
03:17:06.420 --> 03:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
condition so it's not really an age
number

03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
and this might have been touched on in
 
03:17:12.050 --> 03:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
your handout uh but if somebody comes to
 
03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
one of us and asks about uh the veterans
 
03:17:15.300 --> 03:17:16.429 align:start position:0%
one of us and asks about uh the veterans
home

03:17:16.429 --> 03:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:17:18.650 --> 03:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
um how to find out if if they have a
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
relative that will qualify what's the
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
process what should we tell them I said
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%

you a good room and and he's uh already
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
old enough to qualify that's why I asked
 
03:18:37.690 --> 03:18:37.700 align:start position:0%

03:18:48.889 --> 03:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
representative shirtleff for just a
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
minute before he leaves uh somebody
 
03:18:53.090 --> 03:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
asked me about like food drink coffee uh
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we had some there's some coffee
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
sightings earlier uh for hearings if if
 
03:19:00.349 --> 03:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
we could stick to water and kind of keep
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
it oh you know so there's not ciao and
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
and uh drinks on the that people can see
 
03:19:09.230 --> 03:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh if you need M M's to get through a
 
03:19:11.809 --> 03:19:11.819 align:start position:0%
long session yeah sure just you know
 
03:19:13.809 --> 03:19:13.819 align:start position:0%
just keep them below the table whatever
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
just so that it looks good that's about
 
03:19:18.590 --> 03:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
all I can any questions for me I we're
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
gonna have a hearing a bunch of hearings
 
03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
a week from today it's already been
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
published in the calendar you can look
 
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
at those so the presenters the sponsors
 
03:19:29.809 --> 03:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
presumably will be in and uh we've got
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
those timed out you never know uh I know
 
03:19:34.790 --> 03:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
some of you would know uh you never know
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
so you think you may have uh a lot of
 
03:19:39.889 --> 03:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
testimony for some bills and you don't
 
03:19:42.230 --> 03:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
and you have one you think is going to
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
be quick and it's not there's
 
03:19:45.230 --> 03:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Sherlock I'm sure has
 
03:19:48.349 --> 03:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
seen seen it all so uh we'll try to keep
 
03:19:49.730 --> 03:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
it moving and
 
03:19:52.010 --> 03:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
um give everybody everyone a chance to
 
03:19:54.290 --> 03:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
speak uh somebody asked me once about
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
are we going to ever limit uh testimony
 
03:19:59.210 --> 03:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's just hard to say we'll we'll see if
 
03:20:01.610 --> 03:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
there's a big lineup you know we'll
 
03:20:03.889 --> 03:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
we'll uh do we need to do I don't
 
03:20:06.110 --> 03:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate that being a problem you know
 
03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
last year was a pretty late
 
03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
uh load for the most part
 
03:20:12.769 --> 03:20:12.779 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
27th I've given Karen the list of all
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
the bills or measures resolutions that
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
we don't get to next week we'll
 
03:20:22.490 --> 03:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully finish on the 27th uh you may
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
have seen there's a uh
 
03:20:28.370 --> 03:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
is that Ken back there sure
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I've you have a blue folder and those
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
who weren't here we'll save those
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
folders for them uh we we have I think
 
03:20:36.969 --> 03:20:36.979 align:start position:0%
what's going to be a high profile
 
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
measure is the uh the one with regard to
 
03:20:44.090 --> 03:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
Article Five and I'm hearing that uh
 
03:20:46.490 --> 03:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
there will be 50 to 100 people that will
 
03:20:48.050 --> 03:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
are interested in attending if not
 
03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
testifying so that possibly might and
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
it'll be the very last one we do
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
tentatively on the 27th in the afternoon
 
03:20:59.210 --> 03:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
um probably in here but uh once I hear
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
more from some of the Article Five folks
 
03:21:03.650 --> 03:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
if if they know there's going to be a
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of people then we don't want
 
03:21:09.950 --> 03:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
to not let them into a hearing so stand
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
by on that one on the 27th and then
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
after that I'll talk with representative
 
03:21:18.290 --> 03:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
shurtleff uh we'll have an exact session
 
03:21:20.929 --> 03:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
possibly uh the first Friday in February
 
03:21:24.170 --> 03:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
I think that's the third and I'm
 
03:21:26.690 --> 03:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
thinking that we maybe can get through
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
that who knows I think a lot of the
 
03:21:30.830 --> 03:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
measures may be pretty easy for us to
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
deal with and vote on other ones there
 
03:21:34.550 --> 03:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
might be some that will take some time
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
just don't know I'll talk to the ranking
 
03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
member and we'll try to be ready for
 
03:21:37.920 --> 03:21:38.750 align:start position:0%
member and we'll try to be ready for
that

03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
and then uh so we can potentially finish
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
on the third
 
03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
and then crossover last year we had like
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
two crossover items I don't know if
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have any or a couple probably not
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
much in April so uh those of you who
 
03:21:54.590 --> 03:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on a committee that doesn't
 
03:21:57.170 --> 03:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
take up all your time that you're you're
 
03:22:00.170 --> 03:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
in a good good place I think
 
03:22:02.450 --> 03:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
um anything anything for the good or the
 
03:22:05.150 --> 03:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
order from anybody Mr chairman uh who
 
03:22:07.610 --> 03:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
said Mr chairman me uh representative
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
gagne yes is this currently all the
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
bills that we have right now to to take
 
03:22:14.510 --> 03:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
care of
 
03:22:17.330 --> 03:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
yes I believe what Karen printed out uh
 
03:22:19.490 --> 03:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
is what we've been assigned and I sent
 
03:22:21.889 --> 03:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
you an email that listed everything I
 
03:22:23.450 --> 03:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
could find that looked like was coming
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
our way so you should have you should
 
03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
have what we're going to deal with
 
03:22:30.769 --> 03:22:30.779 align:start position:0%
because I won't be here on the 27th
 
03:22:32.510 --> 03:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
because I
 
03:22:36.530 --> 03:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay then uh that's a hearing day so uh
 
03:22:38.450 --> 03:22:38.460 align:start position:0%

03:22:42.050 --> 03:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
um and I heard from most everybody who
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
could not be here today for different
 
03:22:46.610 --> 03:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
reasons uh executive session of course
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
you all know the drill if if if you
 
03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't be here which will probably be in
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%

03:22:55.610 --> 03:22:55.620 align:start position:0%

03:23:01.969 --> 03:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh good question anything else uh yes
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:08.809 --> 03:23:08.819 align:start position:0%

03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.849 --> 03:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
do we need
 
03:23:49.490 --> 03:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
do we get an RSA book here
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
like they do in the other committees
 
03:23:54.410 --> 03:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
question is do we get an RSA book here
 
03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
um I know in education we had a big a
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
big fat RSA book uh represent Massimo
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
you've been here before uh
 
03:24:07.450 --> 03:24:07.460 align:start position:0%
yeah not necessary I guess right uh yes
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
we there are certain statutes rsas that
 
03:24:13.309 --> 03:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
are kind of uh veteran specific but
 
03:24:15.410 --> 03:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
state federal it's kind of it's kind of
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
all over the place uh in terms of what
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
we might be dealing with good question
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
and the answer is apparently we don't
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
have such a book for this committee
 
03:24:26.929 --> 03:24:26.939 align:start position:0%
yeah and Skip uh represent Rollins been
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
around too and you don't remember seeing
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
that either
 
03:24:41.570 --> 03:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:44.330 --> 03:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
oh sure question was bringing an iPad in
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
iPod and I have one in my bag and I yeah
 
03:24:50.090 --> 03:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
I sometimes use those to call up uh
 
03:24:52.610 --> 03:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
bills or or statutes so great question
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I think yes you by all means I think
 
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
a iPad or a computer I know in some
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
committees some people put up these
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
really big computers and in that
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you screen from the
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
people that does it's not a good look
 
03:25:06.530 --> 03:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
but I think what you describe a little
 
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh iPad iPod I guess iPad right uh yeah
 
03:25:12.590 --> 03:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's great that's a great tool
 
03:25:14.090 --> 03:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know as long as it's not like
 
03:25:16.070 --> 03:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
something where people hide behind you
 
03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:17.030 align:start position:0%
something where people hide behind you
know

03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh grab some carrot
 
03:25:22.610 --> 03:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
just a quick comment on that
 
03:25:24.530 --> 03:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
um during the clerk's training this year
 
03:25:27.410 --> 03:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
they asked us to encourage people to
 
03:25:29.929 --> 03:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
keep things down on their surface
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
because to have anything up interferes
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
with your relationship with the public
 
03:25:37.729 --> 03:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
and to be respectful of their testifying
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
so with using your devices if we can
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
keep them in the same way we're keeping
 
03:25:49.610 --> 03:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:52.370 --> 03:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so she kind of reiterated
 
03:25:54.110 --> 03:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
what I said so I'm sure that answers
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
your question uh there is no secession
 
03:25:58.190 --> 03:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
bill this year
 
03:26:01.610 --> 03:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
um that was a big one I think the the
 
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
article five one I think will be a high
 
03:26:06.729 --> 03:26:06.739 align:start position:0%
I I know will be a high profile
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
well-attended uh session that I'm
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
looking forward to frankly that's uh
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
potentially a significant proposal we
 
03:26:15.710 --> 03:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
had it last year uh I think this year
 
03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
the the folks that are
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh pushing that or I've received a
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
number of calls maybe some of you have
 
03:26:24.650 --> 03:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
too and um so they're really making an
 
03:26:27.710 --> 03:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
effort to educate us as to you know
 
03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:28.610 align:start position:0%
effort to educate us as to you know
what's

03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
what's
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
true we're not true in that article 5
 
03:26:33.290 --> 03:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
convention process so that'll be the
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
very last one we do
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
um on the 27th tentatively the next
 
03:26:40.849 --> 03:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
week's calendar will come out and
 
03:26:43.250 --> 03:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
confirm that so that's what's out there
 
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
and anything else representative your
 
03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
lights on representative gagne uh
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
in regards to this article five yes we
 
03:26:54.170 --> 03:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
have got emails and lots of phone calls
 
03:26:57.410 --> 03:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
and do I need this steal me can you guys
 
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
hear me yeah all right uh
 
03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
what we did Transportation when we had
 
03:27:06.050 --> 03:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
the speed limit bill for Lake
 
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee the broads we we ended up
 
03:27:12.610 --> 03:27:12.620 align:start position:0%
having to meet in the uh the state house
 
03:27:15.650 --> 03:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
and representatives Hall And as far as
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
time limits I mean I ran that because
 
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
Tom had to go to another meeting so I
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.710 --> 03:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
this is how effective pink cards were
 
03:27:30.290 --> 03:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
so we set a time limit
 
03:27:33.650 --> 03:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
for everyone equally three minutes and I
 
03:27:37.550 --> 03:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
had one of my the people of our
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives just have a timer a
 
03:27:42.050 --> 03:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
digital timer and when the three minutes
 
03:27:44.090 --> 03:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
went up the person kind of sort of had
 
03:27:46.370 --> 03:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
to finish the statement we give them a
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
little leeway but they all held to that
 
03:27:52.250 --> 03:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
because we had like 300 and some odd
 
03:27:54.889 --> 03:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
people who showed up yes education went
 
03:27:57.170 --> 03:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
through that yesterday they had hours in
 
03:27:59.330 --> 03:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
reps Hall on on a measure that they were
 
03:28:01.670 --> 03:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with and uh and essentially
 
03:28:04.370 --> 03:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Reed had a proposal at uh
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
rules day in fact I asked her a question
 
03:28:08.570 --> 03:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
some of you might recall uh they were
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
trying to with regard to rules governing
 
03:28:15.889 --> 03:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
chairs and limiting uh being Equitable
 
03:28:18.410 --> 03:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
or fair about limiting speech and if you
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
remember my question was to
 
03:28:22.610 --> 03:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative Reed you know something
 
03:28:24.889 --> 03:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
Sometimes some of you would know but
 
03:28:27.010 --> 03:28:27.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes someone will come and testify
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they break down into tears I mean
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen it this is the question you
 
03:28:34.190 --> 03:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
may have heard me ask her so if there if
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
we do have a time limit uh I
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be have someone who's
 
03:28:41.450 --> 03:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
trying to compose himself and say what
 
03:28:43.969 --> 03:28:43.979 align:start position:0%
okay you're two minutes is up sorry so
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's on me I'll but we'll all you know
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
talk about it and try to be reasonable
 
03:28:52.130 --> 03:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
and fair and and uh I don't sense for
 
03:28:54.410 --> 03:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
most of our men well it's hard to say
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
there you never know who's going to show
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
up so we'll play by you and we'll do the
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
best we can and do the right thing but
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
folks yeah thanks uh represent getting
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
it but actually I don't mind a lot of
 
03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
people coming I I'm a Civics guy I like
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
peop I like a lot of people taking an
 
03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
interest in what we do
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and hearing from them and uh I look
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
forward to that but we'll see uh which
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
which measures you know people and I
 
03:29:20.210 --> 03:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
know Article Five certainly will
 
03:29:20.220 --> 03:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
know Article Five certainly will
representative

03:29:34.870 --> 03:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:37.849 --> 03:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
for this committee okay right so we have
 
03:29:40.130 --> 03:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
the win scheduled for next week and and
 
03:29:42.889 --> 03:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
um I think I the we have the final I
 
03:29:44.330 --> 03:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
think it's the final list of everything
 
03:29:46.010 --> 03:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to get at this point I know
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
there's still assigning a few late
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
numbers uh so whatever we don't we have
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
next week's calendar scheduled so
 
03:29:53.040 --> 03:29:54.469 align:start position:0%
next week's calendar scheduled so
whatever

03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%

03:29:56.570 --> 03:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
we'll look at the final if it is final
 
03:29:59.510 --> 03:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
list of measures that coming our way if
 
03:30:01.250 --> 03:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
we can get them all done on the 27th
 
03:30:05.929 --> 03:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
