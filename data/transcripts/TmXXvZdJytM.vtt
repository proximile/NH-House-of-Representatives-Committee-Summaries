00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%

representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.130 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you Mr
chairman

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
um we were brought forward an issue that
 
00:08:59.650 --> 00:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
seems to be very specific
 
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:03.620 align:start position:0%
to one bargaining agreement one unit
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
maybe particular individuals involved
 
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.730 align:start position:0%
with that
and

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that the process
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
that is already in place was not used
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
and it's intended to resolve these
 
00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.550 align:start position:0%
and it's intended to resolve these
issues

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
the understanding of of the way it's
 
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:28.100 align:start position:0%
supposed to work is when
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh the employees and the management do
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
not agree on on when
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
the times to meet how often to meet that
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
those things are negotiated and if
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
necessary a balance a compromise must be
 
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:46.070 align:start position:0%
necessary a balance a compromise must be
struck

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
struck
 
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.150 align:start position:0%
struck
um

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
if that can't happen and that and and
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
when this bill was brought forward it
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
said it suggested that the RSA always
 
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
favors the employees if they demand to
 
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
meet during a certain time that does not
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
appear to be the position of the peorb
 
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.370 align:start position:0%
appear to be the position of the peorb
and

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
um in this case it was not taken to the
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
pelrb so to me if we saw that there was
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
really an issue with how the plrb ruled
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
and they they said well this we're
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
basing this ruling on this law and so
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
that's the way we have to go I would
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
consider looking at the law and how it
 
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
might be changed but it never even got
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
that far so I think this law is
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
premature at best and from what we heard
 
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
probably unnecessary
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
yet again I am in full agreement with
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
the peo pelrb has ruled on this issue
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
from time to time and when they do they
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
basically tell the parties to do exactly
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
what the parties did which was sometimes
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
you negotiate during the day sometimes
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
you negotiate outside of the school day
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
so essentially the the what happened in
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
that town was exactly what the pelrv
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
would have ordered if it had gone to the
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
perv so I agree that this bill is uh
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and I will support itl thank
 
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.009 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and I will support itl thank
you

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sullivan
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
are there any other representative will
 
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:29.660 align:start position:0%
you speak representative
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is a quick
 
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is a quick
question

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.430 align:start position:0%
question
um the

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
I can't read who was filling in for last
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
for uh representative Mason I can't read
 
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
the um one of the things I've heard in
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
this committee for a number of years is
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
um the legislature New Hampshire should
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
not mess with the bargaining
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
relationships between
 
00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:04.810 align:start position:0%
relationships between
um

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:04.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
bargaining units and
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
who are they bargaining with
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
um whatever municipality or just or
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
organization that has to go both ways
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
you can't have it when you want it and
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
you not have it when you don't want it
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
so being consistent I will vote um
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Sullivan and
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative love
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
I'll also be voting to itl this uh
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
having been part of a bargaining unit
 
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
and uh and sat and negotiated with the
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know with the employers
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
um I I I can't see why we should be
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
giving special rights to the Public
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
Employee sector with that the private
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
private sector doesn't have I had to go
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
after work and and sit down and it was
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
always like that I was involved in two
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
or three contract negotiations and uh
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
we had to go after work it was uh just
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
uh uh almost like a public service for
 
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
the for uh for our fellow employees to
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
go do it and uh like I said I'd be real
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
reluctant to uh to give the public
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
sector bargaining units um more uh
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other additional hands
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is inexped into
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%

representative seaworth you're
 
00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.870 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth you're
recognized

recognized
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll move Ito
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is an expedient
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
to legislate seconded by representative
 
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
to legislate seconded by representative
Boyd

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
motion of the floor is a speed late has
 
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:14.769 align:start position:0%
motion of the floor is a speed late has
been

00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:14.779 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
made and seconded representative
 
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.550 align:start position:0%
made and seconded representative
seaworth

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
seaworth
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
my uh argument here is similar to the
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
last one this seems to be a bill brought
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward for a particular bargaining unit
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
a particular municipality
 
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.790 align:start position:0%
a particular municipality
um

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
and uh the issue that it seeks to
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
address I understand is nepotism which I
 
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.100 align:start position:0%
any of us is in favor of favoring
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
unfairly some employees over others on
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
the other hand this isn't
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
really a nepotism bill
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and certainly when we heard from
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
the the police Representatives that were
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
here when we heard from the municipal
 
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.309 align:start position:0%
here when we heard from the municipal
Association

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
um it seems like a solution that is not
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
suited for every case
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to think that
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to resolve an issue
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
that is particular to a
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
a specific city or town
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and for that reason I would not
 
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.789 align:start position:0%
um and for that reason I would not
support

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative Susie
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I too agree
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
with representative seaworth
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a bill that really
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
belongs uh what
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
the Crux of the building belongs and
 
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:52.340 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
and I'm sympathetic to some of the
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
people I've lived it I've as as I stated
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
before 29 years in a fire service I was
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
on the executive board for 17 years
 
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
negotiating contracts I've seen many
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
changes bye I don't believe that because
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's an issue
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
this specific issue should be brought to
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature I believe truly believe
 
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:15.260 align:start position:0%
that it still belongs in negotiations
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
and collective bargaining and there are
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
ways to change it
 
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.690 align:start position:0%
ways to change it
um

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes it's a lot to change
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
it but if you stand in and you dig your
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
feet in there's definitely ways to
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
change it so again I agree with the
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
representative seaward thank you Mr
 
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.230 align:start position:0%
representative seaward thank you Mr
chairman

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.150 align:start position:0%
chairman
representative

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman we also heard
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
during testimony that there could be uh
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
this could want to file with some local
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have that are protecting
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
um promotional lists and things like
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
that so we uh I also don't think a
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think we also
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
heard um piggybacking after off of
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
Representative avalani's comment that
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
that same enabling authorization to
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
address this issue via local ordinances
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
could be used if largely fix this
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
problem on a Town by town or
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
municipality by municipality basis and
 
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.789 align:start position:0%
municipality by municipality basis and
so

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
um doing a Statewide solution a
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits all when there's already
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
existing enabling legislation to let it
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
be done by the municipal legislature I
 
00:19:27.169 --> 00:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
don't think is appropriate
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no oh representative Cahill
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to add
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
that I I think it must be very difficult
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
for the people who feel they're passed
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
over and I don't think it's helpful for
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining the people who
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
are dedicated to do this work
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
if they if they had the impression that
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's something else in the works I
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
know that some of this is subjective but
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's conducive to having
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
that team of people that we need doing
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
this important work I realize this isn't
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
the solution uh but I I would hope that
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the people involved would find a way to
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is an expedient to
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 410
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
and move secondly we've had a discussion
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%

the consent agenda
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%

we'll do that
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
minutes uh whether uh House Bill 561 so
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman I move an
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislative on this bill
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
emotions in expedient to legislate have
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you

motion made a second representative
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
Prout you're recognized to address your
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.470 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman
um

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
I still have a lot of questions about
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
this bill a lot of what we heard of what
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
people are having trouble with
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
especially in the workplace should
 
00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:54.299 align:start position:0%
already be covered under existing
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination for Disabilities law
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
Americans Disabilities Act or its
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
analogs at various agencies and levels
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
of government Etc
 
00:32:03.299 --> 00:32:04.970 align:start position:0%
of government Etc
um

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't fully understand how what
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
their experience is distinguished from
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
other medical issues
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and while I understand people are
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
having issues
 
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
and they really want someone to be able
 
00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
to tell them why and what can be done
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
um a legislative study committee is a
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
very bad way to do novel novel medical
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
research which I think what is what
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
really might be what they need
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons I recommend uh IPL
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
oppose itl on this film
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
um chronic fatigue syndrome is a very
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
miserable thing to live with I suspect
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
that the least we can do is establish a
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee to examine how CFS and me
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
interacts with present disability
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
accommodation law as it pertains to the
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
long covet aspect of this we are three
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
years into the pandemic slash endemic in
 
00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:04.460 align:start position:0%
fact February 16 2020 the world reached
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
1770 deaths a number which very sadly
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
shrinks in comparison to what it is
 
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.330 align:start position:0%
shrinks in comparison to what it is
today

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
three years down the road we have
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
learned that some individuals have
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
contracted covet in the last three years
 
00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:19.019 align:start position:0%
and have had the symptoms and illness
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
for longer than the normal two weeks I
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
know I hated how I felt when I had it
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
for two weeks I couldn't imagine a month
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
or a year
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
and I feel enough time has passed where
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
we can acquire new data on individuals
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
with this unfortunate disease
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
as has been said many times in this
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee we have to learn to live with
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
covid and this is what learning to live
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
with it would look like but we need to
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
do that learning first
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I would be very interested to see how
 
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:49.460 align:start position:0%
long covid interacts with the current
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
workplace accommodation law that was
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
referenced as a consequence of that I'd
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
like to see the committee established
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to vote against the itl
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
 
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.850 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
chairman

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
um this is a study committee and I
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
always look at study committees like
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
well if there's no problems they'll find
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
out or if there is a problem
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
let's try to get it fixed
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
covet hit us
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
we got blindsided by it and it set the
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
world upside down for a few years
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
they came out with a vaccine lightning
 
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.829 align:start position:0%
they came out with a vaccine lightning
fast

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
fast
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know what side effects are
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
going to come down the road we don't
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
know what the next step or the next
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
phase of covet's going to be I think the
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
cut this committee off and make it go
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
away is we're sure changing ourselves if
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
we do have a committee at least it's in
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
place to recognize a problem if one
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against the itl
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
you know these are front line workers
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
these are people who uh during the
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
toughest of times uh they probably had
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
more exposure than many people uh in
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
this room
 
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.670 align:start position:0%
this room
um

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
so I I think that it's an interesting
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
issue I'm not sure it's necessarily the
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
best issue to be in front of the house
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
labor committee and maybe there should
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
be another committee that looks at this
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
um but but I also and I you know I
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are Provisions in
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
the federal law the Americans with
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
Disability Act and all those kinds of
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
things and I don't know where those are
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of this but
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
I think that it is an emerging issue
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
relative to long-term impact that covet
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
has if it is affecting the workforce uh
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth a look at but again
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this is the best committee
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
to take that up
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
um but I I would uh support the if the
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
only thing we have in front of us is the
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to establish a committee
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
then I would support that idea and go in
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
experience allegedly vote against that
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to see where thank you Mr
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
chairman I I find some agreement with
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
the last two speakers
 
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
the last two speakers
um

00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
and yet I'm
 
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the itl I think in
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
some ways
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
this issue as was mentioned is a lot
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
bigger than a labor issue it's a lot
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
bigger than a New Hampshire issue it's a
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
national and an international issue it
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
involves medical science
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
and well I certainly appreciate
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the suffering that the people who were
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
before us went through
 
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:42.890 align:start position:0%
before us went through
um

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
a study committee isn't always the best
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
First Option when we don't know what
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at certainly this year the
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
speaker has asked the house to look at
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
the numerous study committees that we've
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
established and try to
 
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.589 align:start position:0%
established and try to
um

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
reduce that a little bit where where
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate it can be very difficult
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
finding the people who want to spend the
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
time on these additional committees to
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
study things
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
and so I'm cautious about authorizing a
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee where the scope of what's
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
being sought isn't clear
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
at the same time uh
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
my fellow representative brought up that
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
maybe we're looking too narrow with this
 
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.710 align:start position:0%
maybe we're looking too narrow with this
I

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
had an interesting experience I was into
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
the doctor with my kids one of the
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
issues is my son has no sense of smell
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
he never has and we went to the doctor
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
to discuss this and he said well one of
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
the first things I bring up is that it
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
may be related to a virus and I used to
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
say that nobody believed me now everyone
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
knows and but my point is that the long
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
coveted symptoms are not restricted to
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
Long covet there are a lot of viruses
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
that have long-term effects they're very
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
poorly understood
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
so are we focusing here on kind of the
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
issues due of the day and ignoring
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
as as my friend said uh vaccine and
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
negative impact reactions to the
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
vaccines or people that have developed
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
infections from masks or viruses that
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
are just not covered but still cause
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
these long-term employment issues so
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
again my point is that we've we've got a
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
very nebulous question a big question
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
and it it seems well beyond the labor
 
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with it so I'm
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable setting up this committee
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
I've heard people say that the reason
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
why we should not do a study committee
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
is because there are a lot of unknowns
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
things that we don't uh understand yet
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
about long coveted and I would suggest
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly why you do a study
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee to uncover the answers to the
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
unknowns so I'll be posing Ito in
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
supporting the study committee to try to
 
00:39:31.609 --> 00:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
come up with some answers for these
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
folks and also try to help
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what accommodations
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
are appropriate and possible for people
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing these uh illnesses
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
more of a question if I may
 
00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.670 align:start position:0%
more of a question if I may
um

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
the study of the covid is is may or may
 
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
not be as important as people say but I
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
question whether or not why it didn't go
 
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
to a Health and Human Services committee
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
and came to a labor committee because it
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
has really nothing to do with labor and
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
everything to do with general population
 
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.470 align:start position:0%
everything to do with general population
health

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
health
and

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
I think this is the wrong committee for
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
doing something like that
 
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.109 align:start position:0%
doing something like that
myself

00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Broody thank
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman maybe that if we form
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
this committee people from Health and
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
Human Services should be on this
 
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.150 align:start position:0%
Human Services should be on this
committee

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
if they know more about it than we do
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's an advantage it's gonna say I
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
can answer that question
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic uh one of my
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
favorite things to say
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
um when it came to my opinion on uh
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
covert prevention procedure was I am not
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
a doctor
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
um and this would be a committee to
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
examine Workforce accommodations
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the folks over in the Health and
 
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee are not
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with this aspect of the law and
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
I don't think this can just be a hot
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
potato between those two committees
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
because eventually it turns into a game
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
of chicken and nobody takes it
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I think it's more appropriate for her
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
to start here and as the previous member
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that study committees
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
are restricted to the members of One
 
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:35.339 align:start position:0%
committee I'm willing to be wrong about
 
00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:36.650 align:start position:0%
committee I'm willing to be wrong about
that

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
it would be required for it to be
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
entirely members of this committee I can
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
absolutely see members of the Health and
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee that may want
 
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and we do have
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
several doctors in the house so
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
maybe they would have a better look at
 
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
things than
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
origin of love
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll be voting for The itl and the
 
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
reason being uh you know a little bit of
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge is dangerous and uh you know
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
to have a labor committee where we have
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
no uh no viral Specialists and and what
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
have you you know people that are really
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about this this subject uh
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
you know we won't have them on this
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
committee and uh we could do more damage
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
my concern here and why I will support
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
the itl is we have I've just listened
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's been fascinating
 
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to do one thing
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
the bill is supposed to look at
 
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.609 align:start position:0%
the bill is supposed to look at
accommodations

00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
for school and Workforce for people with
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
long-term covered
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
and such
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
yet half the discussion here has been
 
00:42:58.079 --> 00:42:59.930 align:start position:0%
yet half the discussion here has been
Medical

00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
has not had to do with that I firmly
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
believe there are long-term covered
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
issues No Doubt
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
how it affects everyone's different
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
abilities how it's affected everyone
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and family members who have been
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
affected in totally different ways
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
so no doubt then we get into the whole
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
thing about well is something in the
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines causing things that's not on
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
the table here that's not what this is
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
about and half of the discussion has
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
been about that
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the discussion here in the in the bill
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
is about accommodations for workforces
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
I am not aware and I I
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
I had a time on a plane and I read
 
00:43:50.089 --> 00:43:50.099 align:start position:0%
anything I could find about Googling
 
00:43:50.099 --> 00:43:51.730 align:start position:0%
anything I could find about Googling
this

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:51.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I haven't seen anything I I talked
 
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
to the labor department have there been
 
00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:02.180 align:start position:0%
any issues with someone being released
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
not being given the accommodations
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
um and I had no I didn't have anyone to
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
think of to call
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
um for the school
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
but we do have an issue
 
00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:17.300 align:start position:0%
with long term
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
no doubt
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
but that's not what this study committee
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
is yet that is when three quarters of
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's my concern we're not going to
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
talk about this and we don't have
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
anything to talk about it about because
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know that it has been a problem
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
and that it's not covered under current
 
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.950 align:start position:0%
and that it's not covered under current
law

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
now I'm all in favor of people studying
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
things I think this best thing that we
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
as Representatives is dig into some of
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
these things and I'm all in favor and
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
I've supported a lot of things how many
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
times last year
 
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:53.420 align:start position:0%
um representative Sullivan did I support
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
against the speaker support something
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
which we're going to be speaking of the
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
um so I'm all in favor of doing it but
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
this in my opinion is not doing what it
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
is just the mere fact of what the
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
discussion has been on the on the
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
executive session so
 
00:45:12.839 --> 00:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
executive session so
um

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.829 align:start position:0%
um
that's

00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm that's what is it I'm
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
sticking to it representative Cahill uh
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
um in addition to covid you know chronic
 
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
fatigue syndrome is something else me
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to pronounce what
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
that stands for but these are a sort of
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
recognized conditions that we've had you
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
know in the world before covet and I
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
well I I don't know whether or not a
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
person with any of these conditions is
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
able to get the accommodations they need
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think that was this that's what why
 
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
we're here what why the subject was
 
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:52.380 align:start position:0%
brought to us and uh if we could find
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
out some in some way whether or not that
 
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
was a problem whether the study
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
committee is the way to do that I'm not
 
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
sure but I'd like to support those
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
people who are having these conditions
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
and finding it difficult to work
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and I was warned that a little
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge is a dangerous thing but I'm
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
gonna charge ahead anyway I I know a
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
little about
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
how these issues connect and I'll just
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
share that I I think the connection
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
between long covid myalgia and chronic
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
fatigue syndrome is these are medical
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
issues that are widely reported I I know
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
people that have suffered from them but
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
medical science cannot make connections
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
between the causes and effects in the
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
way that
 
00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
most diseases and most disabilities are
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
made and so the question was what's the
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
threat here and I would suggest that
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's the threat that it's a disconnect
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
between what people
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
feel what science says about it and
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
maybe the way the workplace treats
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
differently a known disability from a
 
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.329 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
so

00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
back to the the the the root of the
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
topic of this bill it's about workplace
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
accommodations and knowing things about
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
that it's those are supposed to be the
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
only reason those should be denied is if
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
they cross the boundary into the the
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
request is unreasonable
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh extreme for the business to be con to
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
be asked to do
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
and at that point it's supposed to
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
bridge over into is the person disabled
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
should they go on permanent disability
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
is at least how I view the world or how
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
I view how all those laws are supposed
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
to interact and so if there's an issue
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
there's probably an issue of
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's a gap in between those two where
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
a person is asking for accommodations
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
that are going so far as to be
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
considered unreasonable yet they're not
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
able to get their permanent disability
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
and be not expected to work
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
that would be the Gap that we would I
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
would see that would need to be studied
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
but that's not the topic of the study
 
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.430 align:start position:0%
but that's not the topic of the study
committee

00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
it is not 11 o'clock but I would like to
 
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.730 align:start position:0%
it is not 11 o'clock but I would like to
um

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
the committee to bear with me for a
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
in and we're not an executive session
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is just me trying to make a point
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
to the committee of what I would like to
 
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.150 align:start position:0%
to the committee of what I would like to
do

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
I grew up in a town
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
Amherst 1700 people 1970s it wasn't for
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
the volunteer firefighters a lot of bad
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
things would have happened
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
so I understand the need
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
I'm also wrestling with it telling
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
forcing businesses to do certain things
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
which I think the bill has gone a little
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
too far
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
my intent here was to retain the bill
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
um thought about it over the last couple
 
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh last week or so and we have done very
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
well in getting our agenda done here and
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
we have time
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
I have we have another three weeks or
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
four weeks before all of the bills have
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
to be out of here
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
the remaining three bills we have on the
 
00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.450 align:start position:0%
the remaining three bills we have on the
table

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
one I've gotten to sponsor to agree to a
 
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
retain and the other two we have study
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
committees after we're done today
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
so it is is my request the board of the
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
committee here that if I open the
 
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:17.540 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 182 FN
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
and then close it and then see if I can
 
00:51:24.609 --> 00:51:24.619 align:start position:0%
work out something with the sponsors
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
that is a little more
 
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:27.890 align:start position:0%
that is a little more
um

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
a little happier what would go on and
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
that was that would be my request
 
00:51:37.619 --> 00:51:39.650 align:start position:0%
that was that would be my request
representative

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I can't speak
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
for other members of the committee but I
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
would want to say that I would
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
um strongly oppose
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
um putting this off the problem that I
 
00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
see and maybe if somebody wants to
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
provide some specifics
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
um that I could entertain them these are
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
the identical protections that exist for
 
00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
members of the National Guard and the
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
Armory Marine Navy Air Force and Coast
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
Guard Reserves
 
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
I don't see what splitting the
 
00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
difference here is
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
they are protections that would ensure
 
00:52:17.089 --> 00:52:17.099 align:start position:0%
that they don't get fired for
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
having to respond to calls
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
I like I said I'm willing to listen to
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
specifics but I think this is a valuable
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
bill you know as we talked about in the
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
public hearing you know the example was
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
given of the former member of the
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee who is an airplane pilot it's
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
like well you know what happens if you
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
call out of work well it's not really
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
great well what happens if that person
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't call out of work so
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't just apply to fall uh
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters it applies to EMS
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
that is lives on the line uh and I hate
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
to rise to that level of hyperbole but
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's a fact
 
00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.309 align:start position:0%
it's a fact
um

00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
I really just don't understand what
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
compromise could possibly exist here
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
where everybody's going to be happy if
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
they're going to be protections then the
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
employer is not going to be thrilled 100
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the time however as I said they are
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
the identical protections that we
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
already have for reservists the only
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
complaint that I would have about this
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill is that it doesn't extend to you
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
know other facets of the emergency
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
response system
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
um but that doesn't sound like the
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
direction that the compromise would be
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
intended to go in so I can just say that
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
I would oppose putting this off because
 
00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
I don't see a resolution
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
the difference would be this walks out
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
of here today A 10 10 no recommendation
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
or it waits three weeks
 
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
and I bring something forth
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
that could possibly be unanimous
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may bring this up here I
 
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.569 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may bring this up here I
did

00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
um spend some time talking with police
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
fire chiefs and a Gentleman who I worked
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
with who is a volunteer firefighter and
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
has been for 30 years to get their
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
opinions on this and the gentleman I
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
worked with for for 25 years said that
 
00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
over his 30-year career as a volunteer
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
firefighter he's only missed work five
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
to six times due to the need to respond
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
to fire he did say though that there are
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
a handful of people who do abuse the
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
privilege of going to fill up the the
 
00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:29.339 align:start position:0%
fire truck and take any opportunity they
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
can to volunteer for other aspects that
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
really are not required for them to miss
 
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
their other employment
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that there may be some
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
slight abuse to this and in speaking
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
with a couple of local Fire Chiefs
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
um you know their opinion on this is if
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
they aren't responding to a fire or
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
emergency actual emergency call then
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
they should not be skipping work to
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
address other issues within the
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
firehouse but they also said this is
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
truly not a volunteer that they are paid
 
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
for their services when they're
 
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.370 align:start position:0%
for their services when they're
responding

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
representative Drago again this is in
 
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:08.940 align:start position:0%
informal I appreciate it
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
um the conversation I
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
so to try to keep it um
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the subject that I would like to open
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
it close it and then try to work on it
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
with a sponsor some more that is the
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
only thing I'm asking go ahead represent
 
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:22.910 align:start position:0%
only thing I'm asking go ahead represent
dragon

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
dragon
 
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
the only thing I was thinking is you
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
were asking about the difference between
 
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
the National Guard and possibly a first
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
responder I think a National Guard
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
for the most part unless it's a flooding
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
situation maybe they get called up but
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
for the most part they know when they're
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
going to be deployed and gives a
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
business a chance to
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
find a substitute for the duration that
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
they're gone whereas if somebody takes
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency call tomorrow that business
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
um have the manpower to fill in for the
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
job that's supposed to be done that day
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's the only difference I can think
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
of but you are asking and that's what
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative pathogen and then
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
and then love so just want to touch on
 
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
and then love so just want to touch on
that

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I am a proud veteran of the United
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
States Marine Corps Reserve
 
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.510 align:start position:0%
States Marine Corps Reserve
um

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
the National Guard in New Hampshire has
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of a reliable schedule
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
but I cannot count the number of times
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
where uh squad leader texted on Tuesday
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
night by the way you got to be here
 
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
Thursday morning when we were not
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
intending to have drill until Saturday
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
or Sunday
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
um it's not always that predictable
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
um when you're 80 or full-time service
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
in the summer gets scheduled it's not
 
00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
always as ahead of the clock as possible
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
um that's that's on that point
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
um to respond to the chairman like I
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
said I would be very interested to see
 
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
some more specifics
 
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
um as I told my ranking member a couple
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
00:56:56.099 --> 00:56:56.690 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
um

00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
a wise person once said to me that the
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
longer you give something to go wrong
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
the more likely it is that it will
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and I believe in this bill very
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
strongly so
 
00:57:10.329 --> 00:57:10.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
Mackenzie thank you Mr chairman
 
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:13.970 align:start position:0%
Mackenzie thank you Mr chairman
um

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
so what's what's being asked of us
 
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.150 align:start position:0%
so what's what's being asked of us
um

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
by you as a chair is that you would like
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
some time
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to um to look at some uh some
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill potentially come
 
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.349 align:start position:0%
aspects of this bill potentially come
back

00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
um the situation we'll be in at that
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
point is it could be potentially an
 
00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
amendment offered we could reject the
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and vote on the actual bill
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
was presented uh so we'll be in the same
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
basically you could be back in the same
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
position uh I I would um you know I
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
would support the the concept of us of
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
allowing uh you and and people that
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
you're working with uh more time to be
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
able to do this we have some time to do
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
this uh I would say uh you know in
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
response to my colleague uh you know the
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
EMS system and the fire system uh and
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
the the role that volunteers playing
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
that it's an important role in New
 
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.849 align:start position:0%
that it's an important role in New
Hampshire

00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
um you know as a as a person who has
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
spent 27 years in in Manchester fire I
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
would much rather see full-time
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters but the reality is to many
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that's not possible so
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a vehicle uh you know
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
as a professional firefighters we worked
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
hard to uh to make sure that the
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers live up to certain standards
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh that they go there many of them are
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
going to school on the side and learning
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
and getting certified uh so it's a much
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
different uh business today for
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters but I would
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
support the concept of you taking a bit
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
more time if you need it and then come
 
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
back and we'll take a look at what the
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
uh what your work is and what you
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I'd certainly be
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of your proposal
 
00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the the bills to me needs work
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
um you know and representative Edgerton
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
talked about uh you know a two-day
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
notice uh these people uh don't have
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
20-minute notices and uh for a small
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
business to somebody that for a business
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
with you know two three four five
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
employees uh that that could be have a
 
00:59:24.289 --> 00:59:24.299 align:start position:0%
devastating effect
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
um you know we I think it needs to be
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
amended to to have a at least a you know
 
00:59:31.849 --> 00:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
a minimum employee
 
00:59:31.859 --> 00:59:33.049 align:start position:0%
a minimum employee
um

00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
um language in there uh you know I could
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
see it being good for a a company with
 
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
25 employees but not somebody with five
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
and uh you know uh I'd be in favor of
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
that but uh you know as it sits right
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
now I'd have to you know be voting for a
 
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
for an itl on it
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
representative colquin
 
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:56.220 align:start position:0%
so my question that I would like to
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit more about is
 
01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
when you are deployed or sent out a
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
National Guard or any other Reserve do
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to decline that
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
um where I would say at the volunteer
 
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
firefighter or EMS they do have the
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
ability to decline it they may choose
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
not to and rightfully so but I don't
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
believe it it's a requirement that they
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
are you are you asking a representative
 
01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:28.789 align:start position:0%
are you are you asking a representative
attitude

01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
attitude
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry
 
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.190 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry
I'm

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by uh
 
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.089 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by uh
Brody

01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
Brody
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.730 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
first of all having served as chair of
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
um I understand that you as chair are
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
not asking us but you get to schedule
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
things so I I know you're not a
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed uh chair but basically you
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
get to schedule and if you've decided to
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
put this off it's going to be put off I
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
get that and that's that's fine
 
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.130 align:start position:0%
get that and that's that's fine
um

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
I would simply suggest that we proceed
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
with caution because I wouldn't want the
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
pendulum to swing so far that we end up
 
01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
with another 10 10 vote for different
 
01:01:19.619 --> 01:01:21.289 align:start position:0%
with another 10 10 vote for different
reasons

01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
let's be careful as we go forward
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
because if you amend too far people will
 
01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw their support for other reasons
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
um one other point I believe that
 
01:01:39.849 --> 01:01:39.859 align:start position:0%
most folks self-select
 
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
with regard to volunteering or not
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
volunteering for these roles if you know
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
you've got a job that won't tolerate
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
being a wave on short notice you don't
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer I I would have liked to but on
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
the volunteer fire department in
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
Grantham but I had a job that would not
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
have tolerated it I was
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
on the road all the time I wouldn't have
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
been available I wouldn't have been able
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
to get out for a fire so it didn't fit
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
my life so I uh I never volunteered and
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of that happens people
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
know that my job is one where I can step
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
away without the sky falling
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think it's as big a problem
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
as we make it out to be
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
but I also hear what folks are saying
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
about there being a lack of volunteers I
 
01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:33.020 align:start position:0%
hear that there's a lack of full-timers
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
so essentially anything we can do to
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
bolster the core of volunteers for these
 
01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:42.380 align:start position:0%
roles I think we should do but
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
let's pause let's try to make it better
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
and let's be careful while we do it
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
 
01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:51.650 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
chairman

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
um half of the reasons why I spoke on
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
the last bill is the same reasons for
 
01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:02:59.089 --> 01:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
um I'm always ready to look at something
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't make it better
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
um one thing about especially a small
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
town if
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
if I have a job that takes up a lot of
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
time and I don't think I can serve I
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
won't serve however
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
getting any kind of help if this if your
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
house is on fire
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of people who might
 
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
be available might be able to help out
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
you'd appreciate them if they were there
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
and if they just take themselves out of
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
the game ahead of time
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be available so I
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
think anything we can come up with is
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
probably better than what we have now
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to take a look and see
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
if you can come up with something
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
instead of drawing a Line in the Sand
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
today thank you thank you representative
 
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.010 align:start position:0%
today thank you thank you representative
Drago

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
Drago
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
I just want to share my own personal
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
thought on this maybe that's something
 
01:03:55.609 --> 01:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
everybody can think about and figure out
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
a way to make it work I do agree about
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
having a minimum amount of employees
 
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
because taking away
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
one employee went to two employee
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
business is a lot different than taking
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
away an employee from say a Walmart who
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
can Shuffle employee around for a few
 
01:04:08.339 --> 01:04:09.289 align:start position:0%
can Shuffle employee around for a few
hours

01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
during the testimony one of the big
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
things they said well one of the selling
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
points was that we didn't have to pay
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
him which I don't think most businesses
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
would worry about that some probably
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
would but
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh the big thing was that they might
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
show up a few hours late
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh I own a landscape business and part
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
of that snow removal and my concern
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
if it's snowing in the morning which is
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
probably when a lot of people might get
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
called in for an emergency
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
that plow route possibly is not being
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
covered if Mrs Smith walks out of her
 
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
condo and slips
 
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
because that parking lot wasn't cleared
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for that it's probably
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
going to be me as a business owner
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
I can't do anything about replacing the
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
employee under this bill
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
but yet I can't perform my job and now
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
I'm liable so I don't know how we go
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
about fixing that but that's going to be
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
a problem for a lot of different
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
employers across the state of if if this
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you origin of avaloni thank you Mr
 
01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.890 align:start position:0%
thank you origin of avaloni thank you Mr
chairman

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
um as a business owner if the person
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
leaves during the day to handle a call
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
and gets injured
 
01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:24.710 align:start position:0%
and gets injured
um

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
does the employee is the employer on the
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
hook for workman's compensation or is
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
the fire department on hook for
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
compensation and if they're injured how
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
do we handle that going forward if
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
they're unable to perform their duties
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
at work do we have to hold the job Farm
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
because they're on workman's
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
compensation under another
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
um employer at the time or is the
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
their regular full-time employer have to
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
hold their job because they want to if
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to get into
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
answering for the Department of Labor I
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
do know the answers to some of those but
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes and no
 
01:06:07.079 --> 01:06:07.730 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes and no
um

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
just so you guys understand what I'm
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
looking at okay
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think the time of effect of 60 days
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
after passage I just think it needs a
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
little more time maybe 120 days
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
something like that not a lot just will
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
be the notification time for employers
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
second thing line five no employer shall
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
discharge 100 okay with that
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
not just charging
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
or take any other disciplinary actions
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
they'd like to work something where if
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
someone's abusing the situation they can
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
be put on notice by the employer
 
01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
not a lot of things here that I'm
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
looking for a little bit of
 
01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
um ability for the employer to say hey
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
look you know it it it just been a lot
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
of different things here you can't you
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
know it's causing a problem them to be
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
able to at least have some kind of a say
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
but they can't be discharged for showing
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
up to a fire or an emergency call
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the small changes I
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
would like to make
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
um to the bill we're not talking about a
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
wholesale things representative Sullivan
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not trying to put a poison
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
pill in here okay I don't have the votes
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
to get you what you want
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
I don't feel good
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
as an individual
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
arguing against this bill on the house
 
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.849 align:start position:0%
arguing against this bill on the house
floor

01:07:18.849 --> 01:07:18.859 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
what good is it if I already know that
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some roadblocks if I
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
if it does pass
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
by just a couple votes in the house and
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
it goes to Senate and is killed
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
so if I can put something together that
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
I can get a number of Republicans on
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
this committee to go with and I can at
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
on the house floor
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
adequately speak
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
on something consistent with what we
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
normally do here in the labor committee
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
is to let the employers have a say when
 
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
needed then the chance of me walking
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and testifying that
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of this and getting this
 
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:53.579 align:start position:0%
bill passed because what good is it we
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
pass it here and it's not good enough to
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
get passed over there and I'm trying to
 
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.890 align:start position:0%
get passed over there and I'm trying to
think

01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
a little bit further and and my
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
conscience will not conscience will not
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
killing this bill
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
knowing all these small towns
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
representative kale
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I certainly
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate your laying your cards on the
 
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.309 align:start position:0%
appreciate your laying your cards on the
table

01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I I would support extending it
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
giving it more time to work that and
 
01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
maybe a few other things out I was
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
interested in the idea of a minimum
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
number of employees
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
maybe 15 that's the number that's been
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
used Elsewhere for the Department of
 
01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.709 align:start position:0%
used Elsewhere for the Department of
Labor

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
and so that might help get a couple more
 
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
people on board
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
and also I think the language it doesn't
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about it being emergency not
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
filling up the
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
the going to go I see people driving the
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
fire truck going to the go to the
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
supermarket I don't think that applies
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
here that's the professionals that do
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I think you
 
01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I think you
know

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
continuing on the the other odd
 
01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
situations that you can see coming up
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
here is
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not sure if
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
canceling the balance of the shift would
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
be considered the disciplinary action
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
which I could absolutely see happening
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases whereas if you don't show
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
up at the start of the day and you're
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to you know join a crew and go
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
go jointly on a truck somewhere if you
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
show up late you miss the truck
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
what's the employer supposed to do
 
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
in that scenario and so um I don't know
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
whether showing you know saying the
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
employer saying no you can't show up
 
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
halfway through the shift and expect us
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
to make it work whether that would be
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
considered other disciplinary action
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not going to try to micromanage
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
anything I'm just going to make it so
 
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
and then people can discuss you know we
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
do have a labor department to adjudicate
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
some of these things I'm trying to make
 
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
it just allowable
 
01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.669 align:start position:0%
it just allowable
um

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
so it's not so hard and fast but I'm not
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
going to keep going I got two things
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
that we gotta represent Bouchard antigen
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
as I'm listening to the to the
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I I would hope that you
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that this is a cost
 
01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
of having a volunteer fire department
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
I mean if you choose to have a volunteer
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
fire department
 
01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.110 align:start position:0%
fire department
uh

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have this problem
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I think the
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
businesses should take that into
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's about that
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
great I'm just about agent

um
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
taking a look at disciplinary action
 
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:08.900 align:start position:0%
line I
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
it's a little weird for me as far as
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
what counts as disciplinary action
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I can condone
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%

squared this away before today
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
um because I I like I said I like this
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill a lot I think it serves a valid
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
purpose I think it's fair
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
um for the salt of the earth individuals
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%

I'll I will be grudgingly accept a delay
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
on the promise that the next time

um we exec that we have a plan to exec
 
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:59.870 align:start position:0%

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
whether my committee fellow Republicans
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
agree or not will be something that I'm
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%

01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by
 
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.910 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan followed by

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
Mackenzie
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:44.060 align:start position:0%
I think we heard testimony that the uh
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
number 10
 
01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:47.149 align:start position:0%
number 10
um

01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
number of people for a bargain unit was
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
arbitrary at the time it was put into
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and I would acknowledge that five is
 
01:22:59.209 --> 01:22:59.219 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary as well however
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
um having um the number at five will
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
open the door to collective bargaining
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
for a greater number of public sector
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
employees and I think that's a good
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
thing so let's make uh collective
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining available to more more folks
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
having done this work I experienced um
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to a uh we're getting a call from
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
a group of employees who wanted to
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
organize and always having to tell them
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
the first thing you've got to do is
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
count to ten if you can't come up with
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
10 bodies you can't organize and I think
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
it would be a good thing if we could
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
replace that statement with all you've
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
got to do is count to five and I think
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
that'll be more readily accomplished and
 
01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
more folks will have the opportunity to
 
01:23:47.530 --> 01:23:47.540 align:start position:0%
have a say about their
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
terms of employment through collective
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining thank you
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you Miss chairman uh
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm old enough to have been in the room
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
when when this law was actually passed
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
and I can attest to the fact that this
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
was no magic number 10 was just it was
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
just a number that was picked out of the
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
sky it was introduced by the gentleman
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
that was representing the university
 
01:24:15.729 --> 01:24:15.739 align:start position:0%
system at the time
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
I had forgot that it had gone down to
 
01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:19.209 align:start position:0%
I had forgot that it had gone down to
five

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:19.219 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure why I went back up to
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
10 but let me let's say in the federal
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
environment it's two
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
uh two people can be organized and in
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
fact I had a unit in my office that had
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
two people in it and they were
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
legitimate back in the unit recognizing
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
the National Labor Relations Act uh the
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
problem with the problem with keeping
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
the number high is um is it it
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises people and takes them
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
out of takes them away from that
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity that they would have to be
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
able to sit down with their employer and
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
negotiate a collective bargaining
 
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.970 align:start position:0%
negotiate a collective bargaining
agreement

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
and if the law right now encourages
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
people to bargain and the law says that
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is in the best interest of of uh
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
employees and Employers in the state of
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if that is the opening uh
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
statement and it is within 273 uh then
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
there is no rationale for trying to keep
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
people out of that system
 
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh which is what this does
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
now there are other ways that you can
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
become a bargaining unit in the state
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
and here's a problem
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
if you're a firefighter and some town
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
you want to be with the firefighters you
 
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily want to be and not
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to the highway uh people
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
or others but you can organize units
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
which are a collection of of people from
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
different sectors as long as they have
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
what's known as a community of interest
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that happens and they're bargaining
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
units and I think that we heard some
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
testimony about that but if you're
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
working in the highway department you're
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
working on the police department you
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
want to be in a unit that that
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes your specific needs uh that
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
you might have firefighters needs and
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
and collective bargaining environment is
 
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
very different from a highway worker
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
and I think also uh in terms of
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters is that there is a whole
 
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
National Organization that they are not
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
able to participate in because they
 
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
can't get in a bargain units recognized
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
by the national firefighters so if in
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
fact the law is encourages people to
 
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
organize if it's uh if if you if you
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
look at the opening statement it says to
 
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
promote harmonious relations uh among
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
employees then the idea that we are
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
taking people out using this arbitrary
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
number uh is unfair uh it's unjust and
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
it uh it puts people in a position where
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
they may not have the opportunity to buy
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
them collectively and to have the chance
 
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
to be part of the of uh you know of a
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
unit that uh is able to sit down and and
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
again I have no idea why this number
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
came it was an arbitrary number it's
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
been in there it's not no reason has to
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
be locked in stone and it's contrary to
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
with the National Labor Relations law
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
says so Mr chairman I I think we should
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know bring the number down we should
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
bring it open it up so that people have
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity thank you
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um see worth thank you Mr chairman I've
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
heard uh a couple of my colleagues talk
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
about Public Employee organizing and
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of representing representing
 
01:27:37.810 --> 01:27:37.820 align:start position:0%
it as an unmitigated good
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I certainly can see the benefits of
 
01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
and I certainly can see the benefits of
uh

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
unionization in some cases I also
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a cost to it and
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
I hope
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh that that also isn't a controversial
 
01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.350 align:start position:0%
uh that that also isn't a controversial
statement

01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and I am also have been here long
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
enough that I remember the last time a
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
change in this bill
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
was made and part of that had to do with
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
the costs on very small organizations
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
and how that might impact the taxpayer
 
01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
which if there are costs that's that's
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
where the burden falls in the previous
 
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
Bill we just talked about how maybe if
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
an organization is small enough
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
something that's a good idea for for a
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
larger group might not work for very
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
small groups and
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
I just want to recognize that that there
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
are benefits and there are also costs
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative love followed by Cahill
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm uh I'm glad
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
that representative seaworth brought up
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
the the employer the taxpayer uh it
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
seems an awful lot of times when we're
 
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
talking about public uh collective
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining we we forget all about them
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
um you know many contracts uh breed
 
01:29:08.219 --> 01:29:09.229 align:start position:0%
um you know many contracts uh breed
confusion

01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know if you if you've got a a town
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
yard with with six different contracts
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
in it and the guys are going one way and
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
another and
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
um you know everybody's got different uh
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
job responsibilities uh what a mess it
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
can make okay uh the the one thing that
 
01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh that bothers me about this bill is um
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
you know there's some language in here
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's borderline controvers uh not
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
controversial uh uh conflicting that's
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
the word I'm looking for uh on line 13.
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
well the purpose of this section
 
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
probationary employees shall be counted
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the employee minimum number
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
number requirement then they can't vote
 
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh have a one way or the other
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative love um that's already
 
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.750 align:start position:0%
representative love um that's already
law

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think the only thing here we're
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
no disagreement what you're saying but
 
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's not germane to what we're voting on
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
here today I mean you're free to speak
 
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
on it but I just
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
anything else I didn't want to cut you
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill thank you Mr
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and I I just wanted you know
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about my colleague uh see where
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
his comments I wonder if another
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
possible downside would be that people
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
would leave small or would not apply to
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
smaller uh business opportunities
 
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
sectors because they wanted to be in the
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
union they saw the value in that and if
 
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
I if I if I can't do it if five I have
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
we're struggling to hire people and I
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't know if we should put limits on
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to speak first or first
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
time before I have someone speak a
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
second time
 
01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I uh I know it's not a
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
debate but I did want to just uh point
 
01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
of water here uh you know my experience
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
with collective bargaining uh and a
 
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.470 align:start position:0%
with collective bargaining uh and a
contract

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.910 align:start position:0%
contract
uh

01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
contrary to I think what might have been
 
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
said is that it it sets the rules pretty
 
01:31:21.659 --> 01:31:23.510 align:start position:0%
said is that it it sets the rules pretty
clearly

01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
um if you talk about confusion in the
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
workforce I think it's a it's a
 
01:31:28.729 --> 01:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
Workforce where it is not clearly
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
defined that there are discretionary
 
01:31:33.649 --> 01:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
things which occur in workplaces that
 
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
Union environments don't allow you to do
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
that uh and I think the idea of having a
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
a collected buying agreement that
 
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
clearly states the rules that everybody
 
01:31:45.010 --> 01:31:45.020 align:start position:0%
understands that everybody has agreed to
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh and that it is right out the front
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
for everybody to see including the
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
citizens I think that that's a
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the town uh to the
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
employees and to the employers within
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
the city within its cities and towns and
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a little taken back by the
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
idea that that collective bargaining
 
01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
makes it more expensive uh that somehow
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
that drives up costs which I think I'm
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
hearing uh in this discussion
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think that collective bargaining helps
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
to level the playing field
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
um it recognizes uh when you go to
 
01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
mediation and other things like that it
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes the environment in which you
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
work uh it says uh especially in
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
mediation uh you know the firefighters
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
are in this town or that time of this
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
town you want some leveling of that so
 
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
and I think collective bargaining helps
 
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
you to do that because it recognizes the
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
environment in which you in which you
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
work and it gives you a target for
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to to go forth but that
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
said in the end it really is an
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
agreement between the local town the
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
board of Selectmen or whoever is the
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen and the employees and
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh negotiations can be tough and people
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
in this room have been part of it
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
um but it is uh it is a system that
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
works it has worked for many many years
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
there are thousands of employees in the
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who work on the
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
collective buying agreements and is a
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
system that has managed uh to I think
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
Advance the interests of of the cities
 
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:15.780 align:start position:0%
and towns and the employees in the state
 
01:33:25.810 --> 01:33:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
I I will say representative McKenzie you
 
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:31.580 align:start position:0%
always do a fantastic job supporting
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
members of uh unions
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with people joining
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
units I think it's fantastic go ahead I
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a great thing for this
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
country it's been a great thing for most
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
of our mission municipalities you have
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
100 firefighters and 150 police officers
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
can you imagine what it would be like if
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
you had to deal with a um uh salary
 
01:33:54.890 --> 01:33:54.900 align:start position:0%
adjustments for each ones individually
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
like I have to do with my employees it
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
you'd have one two people full time
 
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
just just doing that and so
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with Collective
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
barging I have no problem with people
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
getting involved I think it saves the
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money by having one group
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
organization to deal with one set of
 
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
rules as you said all those things you
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
so eloquently stated that are so
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
positive for that mechanism
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
this comes down to how many people pure
 
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
and simple not all the other stuff that
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
that why unions are good or or what have
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
you it comes down to how many people to
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
provide this we are not excluding people
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
from joining a union or creating a union
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms in place for under
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
10 to people to join together it was
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
stated very clearly in one of the in in
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony that individuals could get
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
grouped together through another
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh it may not be perfect but
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
there are there is a certain cost to
 
01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
having 20 bargaining units
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the municipality versus 10.
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
right it's twice as much of the time and
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
effort cost to negotiate them uh I think
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's it's reasonable
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think it's reasonable to have
 
01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
units of two I think that you could have
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
just a tremendous amount I understand
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's a federal law uh and that's
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's fine uh this has nothing to do
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
with not wanting people to join unions
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
and be together and go collective
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
bargaining and you get better working
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
conditions and leveling the playing
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
field and getting better safety and all
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
the good things that come along with it
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's a simple associate of cost and how
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
many num units uh they're going to have
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
yeah nothing precludes any one group of
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
one or two
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
from joining a union they can join one
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
 
01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.729 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
chairman

01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:55.739 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:35:55.739 --> 01:35:56.510 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing about cost and for
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
the record I was a member of a
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
two-person shop and we were in a union
 
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
but one thing
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
a two-person or three-person facility
 
01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:12.179 align:start position:0%
would would do
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
it would make the form and or whoever
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
listened to what's going on
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
many times the people actually doing the
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
work knows best they know what kind of
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
equipment to buy they know how to use
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
them and just because you're a worker
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you don't have good ideas
 
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
this would force management into at
 
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
least listening
 
01:36:37.129 --> 01:36:37.139 align:start position:0%
instead of just throwing out a mandate
 
01:36:38.570 --> 01:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
and that this is just the way it's going
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
to be but if you're represented at least
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
you can get your point across on how
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
something could be good how something
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
can save money and maybe even save
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%

House Bill uh next uh Bill uh Hospital
 
01:40:08.209 --> 01:40:08.219 align:start position:0%
125 relative to youth employment during
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
the school year and at night
 
01:40:11.330 --> 01:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth you recognize
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would move itl
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
motion supporters itl second and by
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Prout
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
motion has been moved and seconded from
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
seaworth thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
um my colleague to my right here uh
 
01:40:33.890 --> 01:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
expressed his frustration at times I
 
01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
um sometimes with this subject he also
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
showed me how advantageous brevity is
 
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
and uh especially when we're getting
 
01:40:49.689 --> 01:40:49.699 align:start position:0%
ready to go to lunch so I'll I'll try to
 
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
consider that less is more
 
01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.229 align:start position:0%
consider that less is more
um

01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
is I've made this motion but I can also
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
count to ten and I know that my motion
 
01:41:01.090 --> 01:41:01.100 align:start position:0%
will vary
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
is very likely not to prevail
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'll quote the chairman I do
 
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
wonder what good it is to pass these
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
things when we're just going to walk it
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate and it has no chance
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
of Passage this is a section of law that
 
01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:18.649 align:start position:0%
of Passage this is a section of law that
over

01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:23.060 align:start position:0%
the past six eight nine years we have
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
changed multiple times I count three
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
four maybe even five changes depending
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
on how you look at the law and those are
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
actually bills that pass that change
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
this law in different ways
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't count the several bills
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
that came to us and failed that doesn't
 
01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
really think about that these went to
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
study committees they went to
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
subcommittees they went to retain Bill
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
committees we've just put a huge amount
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
of effort into the subject area
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little perplexed as to why
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
because it's not one of the big topics
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
that we usually address
 
01:42:05.159 --> 01:42:08.090 align:start position:0%
that we usually address
um

01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe this is a good change
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
to a law that just came into effect last
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
June and we we really haven't heard any
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
specifics about how the latest version
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the law isn't working
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I understand that there are
 
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
issues with youth employment and always
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
have been and yes if we ratchet up the
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
law some more we'll probably get even
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
more issues with youth employment what
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard at all is if we change
 
01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:43.580 align:start position:0%
the law again who will suffer what
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
teenagers will have trouble with
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
employment because we've moved the law
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
relative to their situation so I just
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
too much too soon and and there's a lot
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
of problems with the language which
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
again in in the last year we went
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
through a lot of this language there
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
were numerous amendments to change it it
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
feels like we've
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
taken some steps back and forgotten
 
01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
what's been going on
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons I've offered itl
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative attitude
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
um while I understand to the point that
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman was making I would
 
01:43:27.850 --> 01:43:27.860 align:start position:0%
encourage uh the labor committee to not
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
inherently factor in
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
um what the other body will do as we all
 
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
know you miss 100 of the shots you don't
 
01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:37.370 align:start position:0%
know you miss 100 of the shots you don't
take

01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
um but as it pertains to the bill if I
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
recall correctly last year the bill that
 
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
we dealt with to deal with the night
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
work Provisions was a consequence of the
 
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
intricate nature and the often confusing
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
nature of the night work statute and the
 
01:43:59.770 --> 01:43:59.780 align:start position:0%
Rue Goldberg machine that that
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
monstrosity was at the time
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
and the bill that came before us was
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
basically well this is hard so throw it
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
all out and uh representative Cahill has
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
brought before us
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
um an opportunity to take a look at that
 
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
situation and go we were overstepping a
 
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
bit and just throwing out uh the vast
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
majority of night work protections
 
01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:25.609 align:start position:0%
majority of night work protections
um

01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
I personally believe that 8 PM is too
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
late and is the cutoff and I threw a
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of a fit about that last year
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
um so I am happy to compromise
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
um to representative Cahill's position
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
and hypothetical Amendment on another
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetical motion
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so I would request that the committee
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
not support this itl
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and instead wait for something better
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill thank you Mr
 
01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:56.930 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill thank you Mr
chairman

01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.310 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
see worth and I see some things
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
differently it appears we see brevity in
 
01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.149 align:start position:0%
differently it appears we see brevity in
different

01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
different degrees but let me let me say
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
that I was here because that was brief
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
for him yeah I got you I'm going to do
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know I was here for some of those
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
changes I I was here when that
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
monstrosity uh came about and uh at the
 
01:45:22.729 --> 01:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
request of a particular restaurant tour
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh and it was aggrieved that that was a
 
01:45:27.649 --> 01:45:27.659 align:start position:0%
mess and when the
 
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
former Senator Hennessy brought us a
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
bill from the other
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
side it was about expanding the number
 
01:45:37.729 --> 01:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
of hours from 30 to 35 that wasn't
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
night hours fixing it that was something
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
that was done in this committee and I
 
01:45:45.169 --> 01:45:45.179 align:start position:0%
think it was an error I think it was too
 
01:45:45.179 --> 01:45:45.950 align:start position:0%
think it was an error I think it was too
far

01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
and so what I've done in this bill is to
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
come up with really pretty good language
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
that describes when people are in school
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
and when they're not
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
and they they can work later
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
on a Friday night until midnight or
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
Saturday until midnight or certainly
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
during their school's vacation week but
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's really quite enough and we've
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
also learned uh this I think has been
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
you know kind of shown to us that the
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
labor department is not out there
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the time clock and making
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure 901 we're going to nail you with a
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
violation that's not how we roll here in
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh so I I think this is
 
01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:32.900 align:start position:0%
intended to be better for our students
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
and easy easier to follow for our
 
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
businesses and there is still a small
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
fly in the ointment in the current
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
language where somebody could work up 48
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
hours if the if the uh was only one uh
 
01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
four days in the school week so we do
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
need to do something and I think the
 
01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
language I have here with a minor
 
01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment will take will take care of us
 
01:47:01.729 --> 01:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.770 --> 01:47:08.780 align:start position:0%
my big concern about the bail
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
is trying to figure out how a
 
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.169 align:start position:0%
is trying to figure out how a
student

01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:15.179 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
student
can

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
go through their academic requirements
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
they're extracurricular requirements
 
01:47:27.290 --> 01:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
their social requirements
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
and work more than 15 hours a week
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
during a school week
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
however I will support this bill because
 
01:47:40.129 --> 01:47:40.139 align:start position:0%
it makes a bad Bill a little bit better
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
for me
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
and for students
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
 
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:50.270 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
foreign

01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
I will be supporting itl on this bill
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
because I do not feel that we should
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
have to designate a specific time that
 
01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
students cannot work Beyond
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and not everybody attends public
 
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.330 align:start position:0%
um and not everybody attends public
school

01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
um and each family unit may be different
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
so some family businesses may be open
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
past nine o'clock and they may want
 
01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
their children and allow their children
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
to work past nine o'clock and they may
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
feel that their child can handle that
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
appropriately and I think it's the
 
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
parents responsibility to manage what
 
01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:25.209 align:start position:0%
parents responsibility to manage what
hours

01:48:25.209 --> 01:48:25.219 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
given hours during the day that their
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
child can or cannot work
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
I have nothing against the Restriction
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
of how many hours cumulative during the
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
week I do disagree with us mandating
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
that they must be done at nine the other
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
thing is there may be some internships
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
that are available to some of these
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
students who are focusing in a specific
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
career path that work Beyond nine
 
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
o'clock so this may give them an
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get involved in an
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
internship to help with their career
 
01:48:58.970 --> 01:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.209 --> 01:49:02.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um we've had
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
discussions about this and I do
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
um desire to allow parents to parents
 
01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
um but there was a former speaker of
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
this house uh who once told me that
 
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't make laws for the
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
many we make laws for the few
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
um and during the public hearing on last
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
year's bill it was I I'm so mad at
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
myself that I forgot to write this
 
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
answer down because it was the best
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
example of a question that I asked or I
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
got exactly the answer that I was
 
01:49:32.450 --> 01:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
looking for and it was from a
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative of the Department of
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
Labor and in researching the bill before
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
us that created this situation I asked
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
the representative I can't remember if
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
it was Mr Ogden or not
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
um but I asked you know does the
 
01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor get complaints from
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
parents and his answer was approximately
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we do get calls from parents who
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
are concerned at how late their children
 
01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
are working and those parents will often
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
say well I don't want my kid to lose
 
01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
their job because I think having
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
employment is good for them I think it
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
provides them the opportunity to gain
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
some responsibility and a little bit of
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
Finance on expertise
 
01:50:16.010 --> 01:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
um but then those parents get put in the
 
01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
situation of not necessarily wanting to
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
go to war with the employer because
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about what other jobs
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
might be available for their student if
 
01:50:26.290 --> 01:50:26.300 align:start position:0%
they lose that and even outside of the
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
gaining experience and responsibility
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
angle of it
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
um they're unfortunately in 2023 still
 
01:50:37.729 --> 01:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
families where the students have to work
 
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
because they're helping to support the
 
01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:40.550 align:start position:0%
because they're helping to support the
family

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:41.629 align:start position:0%
family
um

01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a good Baseline set of
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
protections there are families where
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to say you know
 
01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
what your employer wants you working
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
until 10 pm you're not doing that we're
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
pulling you out of that
 
01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
um because they don't need to get to
 
01:50:55.619 --> 01:50:56.750 align:start position:0%
um because they don't need to get to
work

01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
um but other families feel differently
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
and would appreciate having a little bit
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
of that state backstop to say well now
 
01:51:07.129 --> 01:51:07.139 align:start position:0%
it's not the discretion of the employer
 
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:10.100 align:start position:0%
or the family we're removing that
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
consternation entirely and just saying 9
 
01:51:16.129 --> 01:51:16.139 align:start position:0%
p.m they gotta go home
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
they got to go to sleep they got to do
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
their homework
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
um and just removing that from the
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
equation entirely so that's why I'll be
 
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.649 align:start position:0%
equation entirely so that's why I'll be
supporting

01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
um a further motion later and not the
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
my thought would be is in New Hampshire
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of family-owned
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
businesses and in this situation like in
 
01:51:43.250 --> 01:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
restaurants and stuff like that where
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
the mother and the father run the
 
01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
business and their children help they
 
01:51:51.169 --> 01:51:51.179 align:start position:0%
help bust the tables they help wash the
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
dishes and they help in all different
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
manners now in this situation
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
does this remove them
 
01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:05.780 align:start position:0%
from being able to work in their family
 
01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
ran business
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and in that situation I have to ask
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
why would we take
 
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
a family-run business and say their
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
you I'm trying to keep it right here
 
01:52:27.290 --> 01:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative Susie was next are you
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
just gonna answer I don't know if that
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
was a rhetorical question or an actual
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
question you want to answer
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative over
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
it was rhetorical but if there's a good
 
01:52:39.169 --> 01:52:39.179 align:start position:0%
answer for it I'd appreciate it all
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
right all right I'm gonna gonna go off
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
script here but representative Cahill
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna answer followed by
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Susie uh I'm I'm
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
certainly open to correction but my
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the New Hampshire
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is basically uh
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
claim you know uh complaint driven so in
 
01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:00.500 align:start position:0%
the case of the family business
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
unless the kid is you know making an
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
anonymous call saying that I've been
 
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
forced to work here and chained to this
 
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh to this table I don't think this is
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue here in New
 
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh this is not a debate you have a what
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
would you like to state representative
 
01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.870 align:start position:0%
would you like to state representative
over

01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
no no I'm just I I'd like everyone to
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
speak but I just I don't want to have a
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
debate here this is everyone's go ahead
 
01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
so go ahead
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
if if if this passes and what Mr Cahill
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
indicates is true then we're asking them
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
to break the labor laws by not following
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
the laws even though no one's calls and
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
complains or not that's still an act of
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
representative Jay Silvestro I was going
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
to ask the labor board to clarify I
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
thought when it was a family business
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
the children are allowed to they are
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
they don't follow the same rules okay so
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
we need to clarify that and not throw
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
that in the
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
country they don't need to have parents
 
01:54:14.570 --> 01:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
for permission from their whatever like
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
the school and and whatever so there's a
 
01:54:19.609 --> 01:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
lot there's a different rule when they
 
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
are family members
 
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Susie thank you
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm not going to support the
 
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.189 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm not going to support the
itl

01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:54:28.199 --> 01:54:29.270 align:start position:0%
itl
um

01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
and it kills me and I've told my good
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
friend Mike Cahill I support some of the
 
01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.010 align:start position:0%
friend Mike Cahill I support some of the
bill

01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
the hours get me
 
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and for the reasons of
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
I agree that parents
 
01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
should be parenting and if they don't
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
want their children working after nine
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
o'clock ten o'clock then they don't take
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
the job
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
but I will say this if anybody believes
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
for one second that a 16 17 18 year old
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
is leaving work at nine o'clock and
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
going home
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
I had news for you all right they're
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
going out they're playing PlayStation
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing whatever okay
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
um that's realistic so again
 
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm not gonna support the itl
 
01:55:16.729 --> 01:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
because I told my good friend Mike
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
Cahill that I would support him on this
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
um even though I do not believe in the
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
hour portion of the law thank you
 
01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.430 align:start position:0%
hour portion of the law thank you
everybody

01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then uh pro thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
all of the ideas here today have been um
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
on topic last year we also changed the
 
01:55:38.810 --> 01:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
um age that um
 
01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:40.729 align:start position:0%
um age that um
employees

01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
that worked in a boring establishment
 
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.169 align:start position:0%
that worked in a boring establishment
could

01:55:44.169 --> 01:55:44.179 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
work in that establishment I think we
 
01:55:49.970 --> 01:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
changed it from 18 to 16.
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that this would um
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
affect those people that are now in
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
those positions being able to work till
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
1am in the morning if they so choose or
 
01:56:01.609 --> 01:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
if the parents so choose or past 12
 
01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
o'clock on Friday and Saturday or Sunday
 
01:56:07.129 --> 01:56:07.139 align:start position:0%
nights we changed that law we need to
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
give the businesses the ability to
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
schedule those employees that that have
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
come to a lie on that position thank you
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman welcome representative Pro
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I think there's been a lot of focus
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
on jobs that require you to show up in
 
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
on jobs that require you to show up in
person

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
my high school job was computer
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
programming I could do it from home
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
I don't feel the deed that you have to
 
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
clock out at 8 59.
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
when I was already in my bedroom typing
 
01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
away just now I can't be paid for it
 
01:56:37.739 --> 01:56:39.229 align:start position:0%
away just now I can't be paid for it
anymore

01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
um and we have to understand that the
 
01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
law we're considering doesn't
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those situations at
 
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:45.590 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those situations at
all

01:56:45.590 --> 01:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
you I think you guys would find it
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
surprising that
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
on Labor Day sometimes I used to pick
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
potatoes in Amherst
 
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
and that I used to work in a high school
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
in a deli
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
and spit chickens and stuff like that
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
and there were certain hours but all
 
01:57:14.450 --> 01:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
came down to it it was parental what my
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
parents said
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
between my school work and my athletic
 
01:57:18.599 --> 01:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
between my school work and my athletic
things

01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
and then I had a daughter who became an
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
LNA while she was a senior at Central
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
and that required her to work till 11
 
01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:28.679 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night
 
01:57:30.890 --> 01:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
during school nights because that was
 
01:57:32.810 --> 01:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
the the program that they had that was
 
01:57:34.250 --> 01:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
the only thing available
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
so it all comes down to it to me I
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let my child work after 10
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
o'clock at night on a school night
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
because that's my choices and my wife
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
and I's Choice as parents so I don't
 
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
even agree with the length of which
 
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
you've changed this
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
um and we have to think of all these
 
01:57:52.729 --> 01:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
different things
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
me picking potatoes or me working at a
 
01:57:57.850 --> 01:57:57.860 align:start position:0%
deli or you working behind the computer
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock at night and all these
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
other things and
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes I do understand fully representative
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
attitude unfortunately we do make laws
 
01:58:12.729 --> 01:58:12.739 align:start position:0%
for that very small percentage
 
01:58:15.890 --> 01:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
and where we continue to try to bite
 
01:58:17.689 --> 01:58:17.699 align:start position:0%
around the edges of this and try to make
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
something perfect we don't have a
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
perfect society and we don't have a
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
perfect situation with employment and
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
and while I respected the attempts to do
 
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.490 align:start position:0%
and while I respected the attempts to do
so

01:58:28.490 --> 01:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
I think you've gone too far
 
01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill and this and I
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't agree as a parent on that
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
believe it or not I wouldn't let my kid
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
my children work it nor did I uh to some
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
of those times
 
01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:43.310 align:start position:0%
of those times
um so

01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:58:47.209 --> 01:58:47.219 align:start position:0%
um well I applaud the efforts
 
01:58:47.219 --> 01:58:49.010 align:start position:0%
um well I applaud the efforts
um

01:58:49.010 --> 01:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
we made some significant significant
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
changes last year uh not thinking that
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
everybody liked but some people like
 
01:58:59.810 --> 01:58:59.820 align:start position:0%
some some didn't like the other
 
01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:01.430 align:start position:0%
some some didn't like the other
um

01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
but I I I have to in my mind that the
 
01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
parents have to make decisions and and I
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't and I I
 
01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes a parent's going to
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
run a foul of of the or the of the owner
 
01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:19.310 align:start position:0%
run a foul of of the or the of the owner
but

01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
I can't make a perfect law
 
01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing
 
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
the emotion on the floor is inexpeding
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's been moved seconded if you were in
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%

uh the motion
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%

further uh motion representative K he'll
 
02:00:34.609 --> 02:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
um I have I believe I mentioned during
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
the uh introduction of the bill that
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
mistakes are sometimes made and Ms
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
McGraw has brought to my attention a
 
02:00:46.490 --> 02:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
mistake that I made in that original
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
language where I said that uh
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
much to your understanding that the
 
02:00:55.609 --> 02:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
people could work until midnight on
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
Friday and Saturday
 
02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
well I didn't say midnight I said 12 A.M
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
and 12 a.m Friday is actually what
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
happens a moment after 11 59 pm
 
02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:09.290 align:start position:0%
happens a moment after 11 59 pm
Thursday

02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
so this amendment which I hope it can be
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous on
 
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
does change it to no later than midnight
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.450 --> 02:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
so I would like to move ought to pass
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is
 
02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:36.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
-0328h moved by representative Cahill is
 
02:01:43.330 --> 02:01:43.340 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
by representative attitude it's been
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
you have the floor if you'd like to you
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
and I know we're getting late for that
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
lunch that some people are going to so
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
I'm I think I've already made my point
 
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
as to why this would be helpful
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
no SeaWorld thank you Mr chairman I am a
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
little confused though 12 A.M
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
on Friday is midnight on Friday I would
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
I would think so this is uh Claire so is
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
12 a.m on Friday really midnight on
 
02:02:25.129 --> 02:02:25.139 align:start position:0%
Thursday or or midnight 12 a.m on Friday
 
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
is midnight on Saturday that I I
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
understand the reason for the change it
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
is a little less confusing what I don't
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand is how it changes the
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
substance of that sentence
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh it it the the intent is the same but
 
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
the language is uh better is clearer so
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
that it won't be well how do I feel
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
about 12 a.m on Friday what is how do I
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
interpret that as compared to how
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
well you've followed and knows that I
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
guess I have the same question about if
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know what 12 a.m on Friday is
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
how do we know what midnight on Friday
 
02:03:12.530 --> 02:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
is because to me they mean the same
 
02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:13.850 align:start position:0%
is because to me they mean the same
thing

02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
just representative kale who brought
 
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
would would you like to clarify with
 
02:03:35.089 --> 02:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is the start of Friday
 
02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:40.340 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to go to
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
2359 which would be 11 59 on Thursday to
 
02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
jump over to zero zero zero zero which
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
it should be at least clarified in a way
 
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
that it should be Friday night into
 
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Saturday night into Sunday
 
02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:06.229 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Saturday night into Sunday
is

02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%

02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
just the amendment uh ocpa just the
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Mr chairman
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
could I be indulged to ask two questions
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
of Representative kale yes uh
 
02:04:26.570 --> 02:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
um is it true that uh the Department of
 
02:04:29.699 --> 02:04:31.070 align:start position:0%
um is it true that uh the Department of
Labor

02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
um often looks to legislative intent
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
um as well as uh the specific language
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
of the text of legislation when making
 
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.229 align:start position:0%
of the text of legislation when making
um determinations

02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
um determinations
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe
 
02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
that is correct and I believe that uh if
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's some if something does go to a
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
hearing you know that a lot of factors
 
02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
are taken into consideration follow-up I
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
concur yes so representative Cahill if I
 
02:05:00.169 --> 02:05:00.179 align:start position:0%
were to hypothetically say into a
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
microphone and on camera that the thing
 
02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
that you're aiming for here is for 11 59
 
02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
pm on Friday and then the next minute
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
being midnight that being in the cutoff
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
and the same thing on Saturday could
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically the Department of Labor
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
look at this exact moment in future
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
videos and say that was representative
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
Cahill's intent
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
um for this language as to decry any
 
02:05:28.199 --> 02:05:29.209 align:start position:0%
um for this language as to decry any
confusion

02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr uh yes they could and

be presented as evidence

02:07:47.930 --> 02:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
to my 16 year old self there might be a
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
few things I'd like to tell that person
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that they would not do some of the
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
things that they did or didn't do uh we
 
02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
we certainly rely on parents and we also
 
02:08:01.070 --> 02:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
rely on employers to be responsible and
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
not to have people working late into the
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
night and yet I do see sometimes see
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
those violations not for a minute past
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
or three minutes past but lengthy
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
violations and and certain other uh
 
02:08:17.570 --> 02:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
violations too so it does happen in the
 
02:08:19.550 --> 02:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
world and I know that this is probably
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
not something that happens with the
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
association's members but again we are
 
02:08:27.169 --> 02:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
regulating all the people who hire young
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
people and for that reason I am voting
 
02:08:36.169 --> 02:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
me another I think everyone knows how
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote if you are in
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
favor of the motion you'll be uh voting
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
yes if you're opposed to the ought to
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
pass you'll be voting no
 
02:08:49.370 --> 02:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
clerk you may call the roll yeah one
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
I have been so corrected
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the emotion on the floor is ought to
 
02:09:07.910 --> 02:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment if you're in favor
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
of voting yes if you're opposed no thank
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a quick question yes
 
02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:23.750 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a quick question yes
um

02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
so we would have to move OTP in order to
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
have the amendment so the motion would
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
the last motion would be OTP and with
 
02:09:32.750 --> 02:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the amendment and then
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.570 --> 02:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
we passed the
 
02:09:40.370 --> 02:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
we passed the amendment I'm just looking
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
on here for what we need to fill in
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
because it says otpa or or adoption of
 
02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:46.310 align:start position:0%
because it says otpa or or adoption of
amendment

02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:09:49.070 --> 02:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
the first vote was the amendment correct
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay the second the this
 
02:09:53.330 --> 02:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass with Amendment
 
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%

232fn

03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
232fn
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:14.269 --> 03:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
do not do it
 
03:13:14.279 --> 03:13:15.370 align:start position:0%
do not do it
okay

03:13:15.370 --> 03:13:15.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:13:18.650 --> 03:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
sure please representative
 
03:13:20.809 --> 03:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
okay here we go
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees are typically informal
 
03:13:27.170 --> 03:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
and I would like to
 
03:13:30.050 --> 03:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
I think we would like to maintain that
 
03:13:33.170 --> 03:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
tradition so a give and take within the
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
committee and uh within the folks who
 
03:13:38.090 --> 03:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
are here to share their thoughts and
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
expertise will be uh welcome
 
03:13:44.330 --> 03:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
um two issues that uh uh came up during
 
03:13:47.690 --> 03:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
the hearing that I think weren't uh let
 
03:13:48.830 --> 03:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
me back up
 
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the the chairman wanted to have this
 
03:13:55.130 --> 03:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to make sure that any
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
um issues that need tweaking or
 
03:13:57.180 --> 03:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
um issues that need tweaking or
adjusting

03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
adjusting
 
03:14:01.250 --> 03:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
are taken care of and don't become
 
03:14:03.410 --> 03:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
impediments as we go forward with the
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
process because I believe that
 
03:14:07.260 --> 03:14:08.210 align:start position:0%
process because I believe that
um

03:14:08.210 --> 03:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:10.389 --> 03:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
the chair and the
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
members of these study group from the
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
summer are committed to getting these
 
03:14:18.349 --> 03:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
safety standards in place and if there's
 
03:14:21.290 --> 03:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
something that we need to manage in
 
03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
order to make that happen
 
03:14:25.730 --> 03:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
um we'll uh
 
03:14:29.570 --> 03:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
do our best to manage that so with that
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
the two issues that came up that I think
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
are worthy of
 
03:14:36.969 --> 03:14:36.979 align:start position:0%
addressing up front
 
03:14:42.230 --> 03:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
were concerns about 20 28a unfunded
 
03:14:45.650 --> 03:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
mandates and also the um
 
03:14:48.530 --> 03:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
the effective date and I've discussed
 
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
that with Deputy Commissioner Ogden and
 
03:14:54.830 --> 03:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
if the Deputy Commissioner is available
 
03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
to come to the mic that would be
 
03:14:56.520 --> 03:15:10.370 align:start position:0%
to come to the mic that would be
fantastic

03:15:10.370 --> 03:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:15:16.250 --> 03:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
we we can start with the 28 a and I'll
 
03:15:17.889 --> 03:15:17.899 align:start position:0%
and actually I'll start with it because
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
representative Mckenzie was uh kind
 
03:15:23.210 --> 03:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
enough to do some research on this and
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
did find a Supreme Court case that
 
03:15:29.330 --> 03:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
um dispelled the idea that any
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
additional costs that happen anywhere
 
03:15:36.490 --> 03:15:36.500 align:start position:0%
anytime due to a change in a program
 
03:15:40.450 --> 03:15:40.460 align:start position:0%
would give rise to a 28a issue
 
03:15:43.610 --> 03:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has been doing safety
 
03:15:46.849 --> 03:15:46.859 align:start position:0%
inspections and has been implementing
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
safety standards for many years and what
 
03:15:53.450 --> 03:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
this bill will do will it will find it
 
03:15:53.460 --> 03:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
this bill will do will it will find it
will

03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
make more clear what those safety
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
standards are because essentially the
 
03:16:02.330 --> 03:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards have been sort of the de
 
03:16:04.730 --> 03:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
facto standards here without them being
 
03:16:09.190 --> 03:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
officially in place with that said
 
03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner go ahead
 
03:16:14.809 --> 03:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
yeah so in terms of I think this issue
 
03:16:16.490 --> 03:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
has come up in the past when I say this
 
03:16:17.809 --> 03:16:17.819 align:start position:0%
issue has come up in the past is
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
typically when we've talked about our
 
03:16:21.889 --> 03:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
safety standards or our enforcement of
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
those standards we have oftentimes come
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
across questions related to 28a
 
03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
specifically the Department's ability uh
 
03:16:32.929 --> 03:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
to compel compliance with things and how
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
compelling compliance in certain
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
instances uh attributes costs or uh you
 
03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
know puts costs upon municipalities or
 
03:16:42.050 --> 03:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
um in terms of I'm not representative
 
03:16:47.090 --> 03:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
McKenzie the specific citation I'm I
 
03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't have that off the top of my head
 
03:16:50.570 --> 03:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
but I am aware in a general sense of the
 
03:16:53.330 --> 03:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
fact that what 28 a is talking about is
 
03:16:57.769 --> 03:16:57.779 align:start position:0%
new or added costs or added programs uh
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
not previously contemplated or not
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
previously in place as I've said in the
 
03:17:03.469 --> 03:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
past when we've talked about these
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
safety standards it's absolutely
 
03:17:07.610 --> 03:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
arguable someone could say that when you
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
put new standards in place you're adding
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
costs and then adding costs that are on
 
03:17:14.510 --> 03:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
funded did that presents constitutional
 
03:17:18.050 --> 03:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
problems that argument could be made the
 
03:17:20.570 --> 03:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
argument was made when we put reporting
 
03:17:24.889 --> 03:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
requirements in place into RSA 277 a
 
03:17:27.170 --> 03:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
couple sessions ago similar arguments
 
03:17:29.090 --> 03:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
were made that now you're adding new
 
03:17:32.269 --> 03:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements in terms of these
 
03:17:33.710 --> 03:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are going to have to
 
03:17:35.870 --> 03:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
comply with these that might incur costs
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that a constitutional violation so
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a long and tortured way
 
03:17:42.230 --> 03:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
of saying that this has come up in the
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
past it's something that could be
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
challenged or could be uh you know
 
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
people arguing about it or or making
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
their concerns known as you say
 
03:17:55.490 --> 03:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan that RSA 277
 
03:17:57.590 --> 03:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
which the department is enforced you
 
03:18:00.230 --> 03:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
know for some time it does presently
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
require that public employers provide a
 
03:18:05.389 --> 03:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
safe workplace it does presently require
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
that public employers put in place
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
safeguards sufficient to provide a safe
 
03:18:13.070 --> 03:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
workplace and again that's where I think
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
that there is some sentiment out there
 
03:18:18.170 --> 03:18:18.180 align:start position:0%
that okay is this truly a new change or
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
is this just added or more explicit uh
 
03:18:23.330 --> 03:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
underlining or outlining of what those
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
requirements are again I do think it's
 
03:18:28.010 --> 03:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
something worth talking about thinking
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
about because it ultimately could be
 
03:18:31.730 --> 03:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
challenged but again this is something
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's come up and been talked about in
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the past relative to our existing
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
application of law
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
do other members of the subcommittee
 
03:18:42.889 --> 03:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
have questions or thoughts along those
 
03:18:42.899 --> 03:18:45.349 align:start position:0%
have questions or thoughts along those
lines

03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.359 --> 03:18:48.590 align:start position:0%
 
yep

03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:48.600 --> 03:18:55.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:18:55.730 --> 03:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
do we need to do this in law can you is
 
03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
the department able to do and adopt
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
these mandates without us telling you to
 
03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.290 --> 03:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
in part and what what I mean by that is
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
that my earlier testimony when the bill
 
03:19:12.889 --> 03:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
was initially introduced I did reference
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
the Department's existing use and
 
03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
application of the general duty Clause
 
03:19:20.929 --> 03:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
so under RSA 277 there's specific uh
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority for the Department
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
to say to employers you need to provide
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
a safe workplace that's also put in line
 
03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 281 a64 where again public employers
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
are told that they have to provide safe
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
employment because the department can
 
03:19:39.050 --> 03:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
require safe employment and has some
 
03:19:40.969 --> 03:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority relative to those
 
03:19:43.849 --> 03:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
requirements we can put in place
 
03:19:46.429 --> 03:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
standards that say you need to do this
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
you need to do that relative to your
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
operation of your organization I think
 
03:19:54.550 --> 03:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
where the department sometimes struggles
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
is that in order to go through rule
 
03:20:00.290 --> 03:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
making and to say okay you know we need
 
03:20:02.330 --> 03:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
to adopt you know this whole Litany of
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
Standards there could be questions in
 
03:20:07.370 --> 03:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
terms of whether is okay are are what we
 
03:20:09.290 --> 03:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
have in place already sufficient do you
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
truly need to extend beyond what's in
 
03:20:15.650 --> 03:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
place already so could we pass
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
regulations in addition to what we
 
03:20:20.090 --> 03:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
presently have without this Bill yes
 
03:20:23.389 --> 03:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
would we be able to pass the whole host
 
03:20:25.010 --> 03:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
of standards that are present place
 
03:20:28.010 --> 03:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
under OSHA I'm not sure I think that you
 
03:20:31.010 --> 03:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
could see challenges to that relative to
 
03:20:35.929 --> 03:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:35.939 --> 03:20:38.269 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:20:43.330 --> 03:20:43.340 align:start position:0%
you could do part of it but let's say
 
03:20:45.969 --> 03:20:45.979 align:start position:0%
there was an accident
 
03:20:48.050 --> 03:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
on a bridge that the state was taking
 
03:20:49.849 --> 03:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
care of
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
um would you reference if you didn't
 
03:20:54.230 --> 03:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
have a reference in your rules or
 
03:20:55.370 --> 03:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
anything relating to bridge bridge
 
03:20:58.910 --> 03:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
safety would you be referring to 1910 or
 
03:21:01.370 --> 03:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards in that case no without
 
03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
this change what we would do what we
 
03:21:06.110 --> 03:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
currently do is if we investigate a
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
safety incident or we're doing an
 
03:21:10.550 --> 03:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
inspection as part of our overall safety
 
03:21:13.849 --> 03:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
audit we see something that seems unsafe
 
03:21:16.610 --> 03:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a particular statute
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
or regulation exactly on point we would
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
cite what I would refer to earlier as
 
03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
the general duty Clause the general duty
 
03:21:24.349 --> 03:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
Clause says and public employers are
 
03:21:25.849 --> 03:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide safe employment
 
03:21:27.650 --> 03:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to put safeguards in
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
place that's what we would cite now and
 
03:21:32.450 --> 03:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
then we would have to have that
 
03:21:35.210 --> 03:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
discussion over what that is at times we
 
03:21:37.849 --> 03:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
do look to 1910 because we say okay
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that's out there at
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
other times we just look to more General
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh even if it's not specifically in 1910
 
03:21:47.210 --> 03:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
if there's like an industry standard
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's out there and seeming has
 
03:21:51.230 --> 03:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
widespread adoption that might be
 
03:21:52.849 --> 03:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
another thing that we reference under
 
03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
the general duty Clause but again
 
03:21:57.469 --> 03:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
presently without those safety uh
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
without 1910 specifically or explicitly
 
03:22:02.330 --> 03:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
adopted we're citing the general duty
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
clause and then we're kind of backing
 
03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
into in order to meet that general duty
 
03:22:08.929 --> 03:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
Clause the employer should do the
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
following or should account for the
 
03:22:14.090 --> 03:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
following types of things so sometimes
 
03:22:17.150 --> 03:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 1910 but we do not have
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.650 --> 03:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
could you adopt that without us telling
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
you to do that in those certain
 
03:22:28.429 --> 03:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
instances where it's not easily defined
 
03:22:30.530 --> 03:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
within your current
 
03:22:32.630 --> 03:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
through administrative rulemaking we
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
could attempt to do that
 
03:22:35.809 --> 03:22:35.819 align:start position:0%
thank you and the in When you mention
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
the industry standard as opposed to
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
General Judy is that the Private
 
03:22:41.389 --> 03:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
Industry standard or the the industry
 
03:22:42.889 --> 03:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
standard yeah when I say industry
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
standard there I'm talking about just
 
03:22:47.150 --> 03:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
you know what commonly is happening you
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
know that if if people in that field
 
03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
would you know you go to 100 job sites
 
03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
that's happening at all of those job
 
03:22:53.220 --> 03:22:54.590 align:start position:0%
that's happening at all of those job
sites

03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
sites
 
03:22:56.990 --> 03:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
so let's just say it's a lack of safety
 
03:22:58.969 --> 03:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
goggles something like that I mean again
 
03:23:00.769 --> 03:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
those are probably be specifically
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
within a 1910 we even have something on
 
03:23:06.170 --> 03:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
safety eyewear but yes something like
 
03:23:07.610 --> 03:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
that where it's just generally
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
widespread adopted throughout the
 
03:23:09.779 --> 03:23:11.150 align:start position:0%
widespread adopted throughout the
industry

03:23:11.150 --> 03:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:23:13.610 --> 03:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
or Industries
 
03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the for the
 
03:23:15.239 --> 03:23:17.450 align:start position:0%
thank you and then the for the
implementation

03:23:17.450 --> 03:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
03:23:24.050 --> 03:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.060 --> 03:23:25.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:23:25.250 --> 03:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:25.260 --> 03:23:26.330 align:start position:0%
um
hello

03:23:26.330 --> 03:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
hello
 
03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
oh there we go
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
um just out of curiosity because this
 
03:23:42.769 --> 03:23:42.779 align:start position:0%
question came up I think to myself and
 
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
03:23:47.269 --> 03:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
if this was to become law
 
03:23:50.450 --> 03:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with NFPA standards
 
03:23:52.090 --> 03:23:52.100 align:start position:0%
National Fire Protection Agency
 
03:23:54.650 --> 03:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
standards yeah I've heard so
 
03:23:56.690 --> 03:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
under this would because I know there's
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
some concern probably with small
 
03:24:00.650 --> 03:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
departments as to the two in two out
 
03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:01.910 align:start position:0%
departments as to the two in two out
rule

03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:02.990 align:start position:0%
rule
um

03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:05.570 --> 03:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
which is an NFPA standard but I'm
 
03:24:08.210 --> 03:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
wondering if this would apply under the
 
03:24:09.769 --> 03:24:09.779 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards which
 
03:24:12.769 --> 03:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
basically in a nutshell says that two if
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's two going in which is the
 
03:24:16.370 --> 03:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
standard there has to be two outside and
 
03:24:19.010 --> 03:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions to the rule
 
03:24:20.510 --> 03:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
um but I'd have to go back and see what
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
the exceptions are I don't know if you
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
have an answer for that if I could look
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
at that specific issue off the top of my
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.809 --> 03:24:38.819 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have four firefighters or
 
03:24:41.210 --> 03:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
four members of that department to allow
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
you to go in the building
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
or maybe if there's two going in there's
 
03:24:47.570 --> 03:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
got to be two outside of NFPA two went
 
03:24:58.729 --> 03:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think there's a distinction here
 
03:25:03.530 --> 03:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
between culture and and yeah that's what
 
03:25:05.690 --> 03:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find skin okay as there is
 
03:25:11.530 --> 03:25:11.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
I I did have a conversation with and I
 
03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
wish I could remember his name offhand
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman
 
03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman
I

03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:25:24.050 --> 03:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
um do you recall who who the gentleman
 
03:25:26.570 --> 03:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
was from the fire uh I don't know if it
 
03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
was Fire Chiefs or exactly who but uh he
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
I think he called you or he contacted
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
you and he actually called me do you
 
03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:36.590 align:start position:0%
you and he actually called me do you
recall

03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:36.600 --> 03:25:38.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:25:38.450 --> 03:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:25:40.490 --> 03:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
I do not recall the name I recall
 
03:25:42.349 --> 03:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
getting the message I recall passing it
 
03:25:44.269 --> 03:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
on to you
 
03:25:46.070 --> 03:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
um it was from Bedford that Bedford
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
police chief that's who it was fire fire
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Bedford fire police and basically the
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
conversation we had was that apparently
 
03:25:56.570 --> 03:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
this two in two out is somehow embedded
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
in the OSHA standards and uh uh you know
 
03:26:03.950 --> 03:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
he he felt that it was uh a rule that
 
03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
was sufficiently exceptioned that uh if
 
03:26:10.370 --> 03:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
if effects if if a firefighter showed up
 
03:26:12.889 --> 03:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
if he was first on the scene and no one
 
03:26:15.290 --> 03:26:15.300 align:start position:0%
else was showing up and he saw a kid
 
03:26:17.750 --> 03:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
waving their hands out the window
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
um life in danger that firefighter would
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
do what needed to be done
 
03:26:26.690 --> 03:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
um but um if uh so I'm not an expert on
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
it but that's how it was explained to me
 
03:26:28.920 --> 03:26:29.870 align:start position:0%
it but that's how it was explained to me
so

03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:31.729 --> 03:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll leave it at that because I
 
03:26:34.010 --> 03:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with firefighting
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
03:26:40.130 --> 03:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
anything else on 28a from the committee
 
03:26:41.929 --> 03:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
or the uh
 
03:26:46.610 --> 03:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:47.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:26:47.809 --> 03:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:50.090 --> 03:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
um sorry did you read the letter that
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
came in from Margaret burns from the
 
03:26:57.889 --> 03:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:57.899 --> 03:26:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
let's move on to the uh
 
03:27:03.490 --> 03:27:03.500 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
03:27:05.870 --> 03:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
there were some
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
concerns raised at the hearing about the
 
03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
if the if the effective date is 60 days
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
after passage that on the 61st day there
 
03:27:18.769 --> 03:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
would be violations being cited and
 
03:27:21.969 --> 03:27:21.979 align:start position:0%
fines being doled out across the state
 
03:27:24.769 --> 03:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
that's probably an overstatement of the
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
concern but it was that's probably the
 
03:27:31.250 --> 03:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
extreme view of the concern Deputy
 
03:27:33.650 --> 03:27:33.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioner could you Enlighten us as
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
to how the department would would deal
 
03:27:36.479 --> 03:27:37.370 align:start position:0%
to how the department would would deal
with

03:27:37.370 --> 03:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:27:41.090 --> 03:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
the expansion or the more specific
 
03:27:43.969 --> 03:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
standards that the OSHA 1910 would
 
03:27:46.210 --> 03:27:46.220 align:start position:0%
provide and how
 
03:27:49.610 --> 03:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
the department would operate on the 61st
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
day the 82nd day the 90th day and so on
 
03:27:55.610 --> 03:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
what how would you operate how would you
 
03:28:00.670 --> 03:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
deal with public sector employers and
 
03:28:03.170 --> 03:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
build up into the 1910 standards
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
so in in terms of practical
 
03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:12.229 align:start position:0%
so in in terms of practical
implementation

03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
upon the effective date so if you reach
 
03:28:16.849 --> 03:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
day 60 that would be the existing
 
03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
standard any inspection following that
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
date uh would we would be seeking
 
03:28:24.590 --> 03:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with those standards and what
 
03:28:27.349 --> 03:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
I mean by that is it's not that if on
 
03:28:30.050 --> 03:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
day 60 then we immediately open up an
 
03:28:32.090 --> 03:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
inspection on every city and town in the
 
03:28:34.370 --> 03:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
state all at once and say okay you guys
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
are behind and here are the fines and
 
03:28:36.600 --> 03:28:37.630 align:start position:0%
are behind and here are the fines and
penalties

03:28:37.630 --> 03:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
rather our practice would remain the
 
03:28:43.070 --> 03:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
same that we're following up on
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
petitions we're following up on injury
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
incident reports we're following up on
 
03:28:50.570 --> 03:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
complaints and when we follow up on
 
03:28:52.809 --> 03:28:52.819 align:start position:0%
those things we apply the applicable law
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
so again day 65 we would be saying okay
 
03:28:59.269 --> 03:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
here are the existing standards we would
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
be looking at the 19 10 standards
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
I don't imagine our practice would not
 
03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
change in terms of remediation and what
 
03:29:09.050 --> 03:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
I mean by that is most of our safety
 
03:29:09.060 --> 03:29:10.790 align:start position:0%
I mean by that is most of our safety
inspections

03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
um they're kind of uh if there are
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
findings it's the beginning of a process
 
03:29:18.769 --> 03:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
and what I mean by that is when we find
 
03:29:20.450 --> 03:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
that there is a violation or something
 
03:29:22.010 --> 03:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
that needs to be corrected it's then
 
03:29:23.809 --> 03:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
working with the employer to say okay
 
03:29:25.610 --> 03:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
what's your plan for coming into
 
03:29:28.729 --> 03:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
compliance there are some instances if
 
03:29:31.190 --> 03:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
it was an immediate uh threat where you
 
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
know you have something that's likely to
 
03:29:35.090 --> 03:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
cause serious harm or injury in the
 
03:29:37.490 --> 03:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
immediate we could say okay that has to
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
stop all at once that has to be
 
03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
corrected all at once but many times
 
03:29:42.769 --> 03:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
what you're dealing with are things in
 
03:29:44.570 --> 03:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
which we're seeking corrective measures
 
03:29:48.050 --> 03:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
or an adjustment of actions or ongoing
 
03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
operations and that's something again
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
where we typically look at it as a
 
03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
remediation period so in terms of if
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
you're asking how would this roll out
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
upon effective date those would be the
 
03:30:00.889 --> 03:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
applicable standards that's what we
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
would apply in the context of an
 
03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
inspection when we cite something we
 
03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
would then be seeking what's the plan
 
03:30:10.130 --> 03:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
for remediation of the employer and some
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
of these plans for remediation they can
 
03:30:15.170 --> 03:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
be somewhat elongated because we do
 
03:30:17.210 --> 03:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
understand that there are things that
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
have to happen before Corrections can be
 
03:30:22.729 --> 03:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
made so when we work with state agencies
 
03:30:25.309 --> 03:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
or we work with cities and towns again
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're coming up with if there's problems
 
03:30:30.170 --> 03:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
here are the problems what is what is a
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
solution or what can you guys do to come
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
to the solution and then how long is
 
03:30:35.330 --> 03:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
that going to take and we're looking for
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
reasonableness in terms of a plan we
 
03:30:38.450 --> 03:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to say okay they're going to
 
03:30:41.210 --> 03:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
wait three years but we understand that
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.849 --> 03:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
at what point do the fines come into
 
03:30:46.859 --> 03:30:47.750 align:start position:0%
at what point do the fines come into
play

03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
play
 
03:30:49.969 --> 03:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
so typically what would happen in the
 
03:30:53.090 --> 03:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
context of an inspection is if we cite
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
something there might be an initial
 
03:30:57.889 --> 03:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
assessed penalty where we'd say okay
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
here's some type of penalty that is held
 
03:31:01.380 --> 03:31:02.269 align:start position:0%
here's some type of penalty that is held
uh

03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:06.050 --> 03:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
in abeyance throughout that remediation
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
period and again really the fines it's
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
not a revenue generator or anything like
 
03:31:15.290 --> 03:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
that we typically don't really find the
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
cities and towns or other state agencies
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's just something that is like I said
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's ultimately out there
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
typically held in abandons through the
 
03:31:26.330 --> 03:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
remediation period if we had no
 
03:31:29.450 --> 03:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up or follow through or if we've
 
03:31:32.210 --> 03:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
had repeated violations where you know a
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
city or a town
 
03:31:36.410 --> 03:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
has not done something and then we are
 
03:31:38.090 --> 03:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
back there and they're still not doing
 
03:31:38.100 --> 03:31:39.290 align:start position:0%
back there and they're still not doing
it

03:31:39.290 --> 03:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:31:41.090 --> 03:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
um that's where there might be penalties
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
but again typically the penalties are
 
03:31:45.889 --> 03:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
put out there in order to incentivize or
 
03:31:49.070 --> 03:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.969 --> 03:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that your process with
 
03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
regard to safety violations is more of
 
03:31:59.690 --> 03:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
an educational one than a punitive one
 
03:32:01.550 --> 03:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the hope I mean again
 
03:32:03.410 --> 03:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
certainly I don't I don't view our
 
03:32:06.050 --> 03:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
safety program as something where we're
 
03:32:08.150 --> 03:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
generating Revenue we don't see the
 
03:32:11.210 --> 03:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
penalties as a revenue generator or
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.080 --> 03:32:19.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:32:19.370 --> 03:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
so let's say we we put this through uh
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
this year so typically all the bills
 
03:32:27.110 --> 03:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be done by the end of June would
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
you be ready to go on September 1st to
 
03:32:31.130 --> 03:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
enforce all these
 
03:32:33.050 --> 03:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
so this was a discussion I think we had
 
03:32:35.330 --> 03:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
had towards the talent of the study
 
03:32:37.969 --> 03:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
committee there would certainly be a
 
03:32:40.190 --> 03:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
learning curve for us but I do think in
 
03:32:43.070 --> 03:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
terms of what we'd apply yes we could I
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
think going forward we'd be in a
 
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
position to say okay anything we come
 
03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
across here's the standards we're going
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
to look to
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
um and to be fair it's something that
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
we've had our inspectors uh looking at
 
03:32:58.610 --> 03:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
probably for the past two or three years
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
we've increasingly looked uh towards
 
03:33:04.969 --> 03:33:04.979 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards for a variety of reasons
 
03:33:07.250 --> 03:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
um but that's a long way of saying that
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
I think in terms from enforcement or
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
understanding what we would be enforcing
 
03:33:10.859 --> 03:33:12.650 align:start position:0%
understanding what we would be enforcing
yes

03:33:12.650 --> 03:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:33:14.450 --> 03:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I think we would have to do a lot of
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
work in terms of putting together
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
educational materials I don't think
 
03:33:20.090 --> 03:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
that's something where I think that
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet and what I mean by
 
03:33:24.050 --> 03:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
that is if an employer came to us right
 
03:33:29.050 --> 03:33:29.060 align:start position:0%
out and said give us good documentation
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
for training that's something that we
 
03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
would have to work towards developing so
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's where I think the most work would
 
03:33:37.250 --> 03:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
be is in terms of the department
 
03:33:41.090 --> 03:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
developing Educational Tools to hand out
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
or provide I think that would be the
 
03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
biggest thing but in terms of
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think enforcement we would
 
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
we would be able to say okay we
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
understand what the standards would be
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
so if
 
03:33:58.190 --> 03:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
we uh maybe we put a lead in say that
 
03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
the bill goes into effect yet there's a
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
12-month lead-in for educational
 
03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
purposes or anything else before fines
 
03:34:04.969 --> 03:34:04.979 align:start position:0%
or fees or something else goes into
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
effect or
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot of little towns
 
03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
that already got the this month are
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to pass their budgets and they're
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
not going to have ability to do change
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
do much change before next march or even
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
the following year if there's not an
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
issue that's found during that you know
 
03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
preceding the budget season
 
03:34:24.590 --> 03:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
um could the wording that you'd like to
 
03:34:25.729 --> 03:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
see that there's some type of leading
 
03:34:29.030 --> 03:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
for educational purposes and I have a
 
03:34:29.040 --> 03:34:30.170 align:start position:0%
for educational purposes and I have a
follow-up

03:34:30.170 --> 03:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
with the would the department want to
 
03:34:35.570 --> 03:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
fund some of that educational purposes
 
03:34:37.969 --> 03:34:37.979 align:start position:0%
or would they need an appropriation
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean in terms of we'd be happy to
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
provide any training that we could
 
03:34:44.030 --> 03:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
provide um I think I referenced in my
 
03:34:46.130 --> 03:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
testimony for the initial bill this is
 
03:34:48.170 --> 03:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
not envisioning like setting up a
 
03:34:49.849 --> 03:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
consultancy program that's something
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
that we're we're not setting up that I
 
03:34:53.410 --> 03:34:53.420 align:start position:0%
think would require
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
additional funding
 
03:34:55.920 --> 03:34:57.849 align:start position:0%
additional funding
um

03:34:57.849 --> 03:34:57.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:01.010 --> 03:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
again I I in terms of putting in a
 
03:35:03.769 --> 03:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
lead-in period i i defer to you know you
 
03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
guys in terms of what makes sense for
 
03:35:05.939 --> 03:35:07.070 align:start position:0%
guys in terms of what makes sense for
that

03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:09.550 --> 03:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
um again I would highlight the fact that
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
when it becomes effective uh I I don't
 
03:35:15.170 --> 03:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
know I would def you know I don't know
 
03:35:17.330 --> 03:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
how cities and towns or state agencies
 
03:35:19.250 --> 03:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
even for that matter would necessarily
 
03:35:21.769 --> 03:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
uh best be situated you know when
 
03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
they're going to start looking at this
 
03:35:25.550 --> 03:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
stuff if they start looking at this
 
03:35:27.950 --> 03:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
stuff uh so again I defer to you on
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether there's benefit to a lead-in
 
03:35:29.760 --> 03:35:30.950 align:start position:0%
whether there's benefit to a lead-in
period

03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I guess I want to be clear that I
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
if there's a good reason to to modify
 
03:35:39.290 --> 03:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
the um uh the effective date
 
03:35:41.809 --> 03:35:41.819 align:start position:0%
I for one uh feel like that's that's
 
03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
fine we should do it and I think as a
 
03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we need to talk it through
 
03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
it and and frankly what representative
 
03:35:50.929 --> 03:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
avalani is talking about is uh
 
03:35:50.939 --> 03:35:52.490 align:start position:0%
avalani is talking about is uh
uh

03:35:52.490 --> 03:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:55.250 --> 03:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
would be far better than just simply
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
saying the effective date is one year
 
03:35:57.120 --> 03:35:58.250 align:start position:0%
saying the effective date is one year
after

03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:36:01.250 --> 03:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
um passage because if if you say that
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
then the um
 
03:36:06.290 --> 03:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
the day after the one year is up would
 
03:36:09.530 --> 03:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
be just like the 61st day if you had a
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
60 day
 
03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:12.290 align:start position:0%
60 day
um

03:36:12.290 --> 03:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:15.410 --> 03:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh effective date so I think if
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
something's going to happen to make
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
folks more comfortable and more informed
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
about uh any more specific oceans
 
03:36:27.769 --> 03:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
um 1910 standards
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
that sounds good but if all people are
 
03:36:31.370 --> 03:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
going to do is wait because it's not
 
03:36:33.889 --> 03:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
happening yet and nothing happens for a
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
year it's just a year wasted so that
 
03:36:40.969 --> 03:36:40.979 align:start position:0%
makes no sense but um
 
03:36:45.050 --> 03:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
I mean if I can see an upside and I hear
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about the fine that
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
basically you um
 
03:36:52.969 --> 03:36:52.979 align:start position:0%
you put a 2500 fine or some fine in
 
03:36:55.610 --> 03:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
place at the at the front end of a
 
03:36:57.950 --> 03:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
violation and then never collect it if
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
people are diligent about uh coming into
 
03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:03.290 align:start position:0%
people are diligent about uh coming into
compliance

03:37:03.290 --> 03:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
um do you think it would be more
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable for the public employers if
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
that fine wasn't there if you simply
 
03:37:13.010 --> 03:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
said you know the inspectors were
 
03:37:13.020 --> 03:37:15.050 align:start position:0%
said you know the inspectors were
directed

03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
directed
 
03:37:18.530 --> 03:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
to inform all public employers
 
03:37:22.490 --> 03:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
of what the new standards will be
 
03:37:22.500 --> 03:37:23.929 align:start position:0%
of what the new standards will be
um

03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:25.729 --> 03:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
with no
 
03:37:28.849 --> 03:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
um action to take no punitive action
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
um possible until after one year is done
 
03:37:32.690 --> 03:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
do you think that would be
 
03:37:32.700 --> 03:37:33.290 align:start position:0%
do you think that would be
um

03:37:33.290 --> 03:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:36.769 --> 03:37:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.650 --> 03:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
possibly again I I do think that
 
03:37:41.690 --> 03:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
possibly that could make folks more
 
03:37:43.800 --> 03:37:45.889 align:start position:0%
possibly that could make folks more
comfortable

03:37:45.889 --> 03:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
there seems to be two the only two
 
03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
issues that come up
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
against this
 
03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is
 
03:37:59.100 --> 03:38:00.290 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is
um

03:38:00.290 --> 03:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
a fear of not understanding and a cost
 
03:38:03.840 --> 03:38:05.330 align:start position:0%
a fear of not understanding and a cost
so

03:38:05.330 --> 03:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:38:07.610 --> 03:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
um trying to think back from all the
 
03:38:10.370 --> 03:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
things you said most Town meetings are
 
03:38:12.010 --> 03:38:12.020 align:start position:0%
in March
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
if you enacted a bill
 
03:38:21.170 --> 03:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:38:23.279 --> 03:38:23.870 align:start position:0%
you have
um

03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:26.510 align:start position:0%
um
in

03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:38:29.090 --> 03:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
the latter part of because you know
 
03:38:31.010 --> 03:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
let's be honest it's going to get past
 
03:38:33.050 --> 03:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
if it gets passed and it's June right
 
03:38:35.450 --> 03:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here in June
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
03:38:39.650 --> 03:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
from September to December the
 
03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
does some roving Road shows
 
03:38:45.120 --> 03:38:46.670 align:start position:0%
does some roving Road shows
and

03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:50.690 --> 03:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
um to explain what 1910 is for some what
 
03:38:52.729 --> 03:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
things will be required it gives them
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
also time to put their own rules in
 
03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
place because they're you know we we
 
03:38:57.950 --> 03:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
send them a law congratulations have a
 
03:38:59.330 --> 03:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
good day someone's got a
 
03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
figure out the rules and what they're
 
03:39:00.899 --> 03:39:01.990 align:start position:0%
figure out the rules and what they're
doing

03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:39:04.849 --> 03:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
it allows people in the latter part of
 
03:39:07.190 --> 03:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
the year to know what if anything they
 
03:39:08.690 --> 03:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
need to purchase
 
03:39:11.090 --> 03:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
that can be part of town meeting and
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
then they can acquire what they need
 
03:39:16.130 --> 03:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
learn how to use it and it becomes
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
effective June 1st
 
03:39:23.210 --> 03:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
I like a timeline like like that I'm not
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
sure we need to
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
um actually put anything into the
 
03:39:30.779 --> 03:39:31.849 align:start position:0%
um actually put anything into the
statute

03:39:31.849 --> 03:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:39:31.859 --> 03:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
statute
to

03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
state that they can't find anyone for a
 
03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:37.490 align:start position:0%
state that they can't find anyone for a
year

03:39:37.490 --> 03:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
I have maybe maybe I'm off my rocker
 
03:39:42.290 --> 03:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
here but I have a lot of faith in the
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to find anyone in
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
the first six months as they're trying
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
to work their way through this I I just
 
03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
I unlike other states our department of
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
labor is more of a teaching mechanism
 
03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
department to get these these people to
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
do it right the first time I think if
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
maybe they went to a municipality they
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
continue to not do something
 
03:40:06.769 --> 03:40:06.779 align:start position:0%
uh for a year in a row and if they stop
 
03:40:08.330 --> 03:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
by three times they would probably do
 
03:40:09.650 --> 03:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
something so I don't know if I want to
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
put that in the well you can make a
 
03:40:13.610 --> 03:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
agreement with the commissioner that we
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't want them to do that well my
 
03:40:17.570 --> 03:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
intent wasn't to say there will be no
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
fines because I think uh Rudy would
 
03:40:23.450 --> 03:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
readily say that for egregious
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
violations of current standards the
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
department would be right on top of it
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
and would take whatever action is
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to make things safe
 
03:40:39.290 --> 03:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
but if we made the implementation
 
03:40:43.130 --> 03:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I think what you're suggesting is
 
03:40:46.130 --> 03:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
make it a year out right it also allows
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
us to do this we passed this thing in
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
June or the governor whoever signs it or
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't signs it in June
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
and they have these Road shows in the
 
03:40:55.429 --> 03:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
latter part of the year
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
it allows for a situation where
 
03:41:00.229 --> 03:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
something comes up that we didn't know
 
03:41:03.170 --> 03:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
whoops we didn't see that
 
03:41:05.570 --> 03:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
thing that you know I I've tried to read
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
that voluminous thing uh it you know I
 
03:41:11.330 --> 03:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
you know geez it's better than a
 
03:41:13.010 --> 03:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
sleeping pill
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
um the um and I'm still reading it
 
03:41:18.290 --> 03:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
because I I I I I want to know exactly
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
we then have the first six three or four
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
months of next year if we have to tweak
 
03:41:28.560 --> 03:41:29.690 align:start position:0%
months of next year if we have to tweak
something

03:41:29.690 --> 03:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
before it goes into place on June
 
03:41:36.769 --> 03:41:36.779 align:start position:0%
30th if you will of 24.
 
03:41:38.090 --> 03:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
and if there's something let's say we
 
03:41:39.889 --> 03:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
find out there's something in there
 
03:41:39.899 --> 03:41:41.570 align:start position:0%
find out there's something in there
that

03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:43.729 --> 03:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
none of the towns have and the only
 
03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
place to get this thing
 
03:41:48.650 --> 03:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
cost each Town twenty five thousand
 
03:41:50.929 --> 03:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
dollars we may have to you know scratch
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
our head on something like that
 
03:41:55.330 --> 03:41:55.340 align:start position:0%
what do you call the
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
confined space
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
the lifts that have to be in the outside
 
03:42:02.570 --> 03:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
and pull someone in you guys know what
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
those are called
 
03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
those are called
mark

03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
mark
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
Tim no no clue so if anyone goes into
 
03:42:09.769 --> 03:42:09.779 align:start position:0%
confined space
 
03:42:11.330 --> 03:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
you have to have this harness on them
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
and it has to have a tripod outside
 
03:42:15.229 --> 03:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
where someone's there to pull them up
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
and all this other stuff those aren't
 
03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
and all this other stuff those aren't
cheap

03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
cheap
 
03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:18.769 align:start position:0%
cheap
um

03:42:18.769 --> 03:42:18.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
I don't think they're exorbitant that's
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
the best example I can come up with
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
right now of something that could be a
 
03:42:23.760 --> 03:42:24.830 align:start position:0%
right now of something that could be a
910

03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
910
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that if all of a sudden we find out
 
03:42:28.729 --> 03:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
through supply chain issues no one can
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
get them
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
but one would hope that if they're that
 
03:42:34.849 --> 03:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
important and for safety they've already
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
got them one hope
 
03:42:38.570 --> 03:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying it gives us a
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
timeline and it gives a comfort level
 
03:42:43.790 --> 03:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
that we have 90 days to get the
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities on board to find out what
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is for people to come back to us and
 
03:42:49.969 --> 03:42:49.979 align:start position:0%
say yeah this is okay but this is a
 
03:42:49.979 --> 03:42:50.889 align:start position:0%
say yeah this is okay but this is a
problem

03:42:50.889 --> 03:42:50.899 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
if we have to make a change we can in
 
03:42:55.849 --> 03:42:55.859 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of of next year but
 
03:42:58.190 --> 03:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
implementation as of you know June 30th
 
03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
of 24. you I don't care what you do with
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
the fines that's up to you guys what you
 
03:43:04.849 --> 03:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
so I agree with just about everything he
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
said the exception of the date so I
 
03:43:11.150 --> 03:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
would go July 1st because of schools no
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:19.190 --> 03:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
because of school school budgeting I
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
think most of our schools if not all of
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
our schools and their fiscal period ends
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
on June 30th so um to get it into their
 
03:43:29.210 --> 03:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
budget timeline properly June July 1st
 
03:43:34.130 --> 03:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:34.140 --> 03:43:36.469 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.929 --> 03:43:38.939 align:start position:0%
because quite frankly I want to hear I'm
 
03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
a Hillsborough guy
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and during testimony
 
03:43:42.720 --> 03:43:44.389 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and during testimony
Hillsborough

03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough
 
03:43:47.330 --> 03:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
there's a lobbyists Hillsborough County
 
03:43:49.130 --> 03:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
you know either nursing home or whatever
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
said this is going to cost us
 
03:43:55.010 --> 03:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
an exorbitant amount of money
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
and um just in case we're wrong on
 
03:44:01.010 --> 03:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
something and someone else is right it
 
03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.130 --> 03:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
supply chain issue for 200 pounds
 
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
getting the same piece of equipment and
 
03:44:14.110 --> 03:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
numerous state agencies
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
would there be some
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
leeway with that
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
with the department and say everybody's
 
03:44:23.809 --> 03:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
ordering just say safety goggles at the
 
03:44:25.550 --> 03:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
same time and there's a obviously going
 
03:44:27.650 --> 03:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
to be a shortage of 200 towns are
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking for five or ten twenty pairs
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
each and
 
03:44:32.690 --> 03:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
they can't get enough for four five six
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
months will the department work with
 
03:44:36.830 --> 03:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
them on that as well
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean obviously we would the facts
 
03:44:41.090 --> 03:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
of each case we'd have to look at but in
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
a general sense the department always
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
tries to work with folks and we
 
03:44:46.849 --> 03:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
understand you know practical and you
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
know reality we understand that there's
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
limitations sometimes in terms of what's
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
realistic I only caution by saying fact
 
03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
intensive because we would want to look
 
03:44:56.630 --> 03:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
at if there's a certain problematic
 
03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
practice that you know someone was going
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:45:01.370 --> 03:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
you know potentially you know losing a
 
03:45:03.650 --> 03:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
limb or their life and it's like okay
 
03:45:06.170 --> 03:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
but you know we can't correct that until
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
we get this piece of equipment we would
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
probably say okay well that we there's
 
03:45:12.889 --> 03:45:12.899 align:start position:0%
only a penalty but that activity should
 
03:45:14.269 --> 03:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
stop you understand what I'm saying is
 
03:45:16.490 --> 03:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
we would you know we certainly work with
 
03:45:18.530 --> 03:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
folks but there might be instances in
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
which you'd have to say part of working
 
03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
with them would be okay no penalties and
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
we'll let you take some time to come
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
into compliance but the activity itself
 
03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
has to stop or be edited
 
03:45:31.250 --> 03:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
um in the interim
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
so some
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
let's say to some safety bar on a
 
03:45:37.370 --> 03:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
transfer station before they throw their
 
03:45:40.010 --> 03:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
trash into the compactor would would the
 
03:45:40.020 --> 03:45:40.910 align:start position:0%
trash into the compactor would would the
department

03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:45:42.769 --> 03:45:42.779 align:start position:0%
give them leeway to fix that or they
 
03:45:44.809 --> 03:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
would shut down that
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
compactor because there was a missing
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
safety box again in most instances there
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
is leeway provided the time where there
 
03:45:52.849 --> 03:45:52.859 align:start position:0%
would not be leeway provided as if it's
 
03:45:54.410 --> 03:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
looked at as like an immediate or
 
03:45:54.420 --> 03:45:56.030 align:start position:0%
looked at as like an immediate or
emergent

03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
emergent
 
03:45:56.040 --> 03:45:56.830 align:start position:0%
emergent
um

03:45:56.830 --> 03:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:00.590 --> 03:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
life or limb type scenario thank you and
 
03:46:02.690 --> 03:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
some of the 1910 required certifications
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
in certain areas
 
03:46:07.130 --> 03:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
how would that apply to
 
03:46:07.140 --> 03:46:07.969 align:start position:0%
how would that apply to
um

03:46:07.969 --> 03:46:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
I hate to say comment contracts that you
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
already have with your employees
 
03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
um would there be additional
 
03:46:15.530 --> 03:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
negotiations that would need to take
 
03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
place because certain employees need to
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
have certain certifications because of a
 
03:46:21.530 --> 03:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
supervisory role or a just the type of
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
job that they have
 
03:46:25.010 --> 03:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
um things of that nature yeah ultimately
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
you'd be looking for those individuals
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
to get the proper certification or
 
03:46:31.250 --> 03:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
licensure to perform those those uh
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
those activities and does that end up
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
potentially resulting in uh some type of
 
03:46:39.170 --> 03:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
adjustment relative to those employees
 
03:46:39.180 --> 03:46:44.510 align:start position:0%
adjustment relative to those employees
possibly

03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.520 --> 03:46:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:49.610 --> 03:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
so the question I got was if there is
 
03:46:49.620 --> 03:46:50.750 align:start position:0%
so the question I got was if there is
specific

03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
testing that needs to be done and let's
 
03:46:55.870 --> 03:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
say the person that's supervising the
 
03:46:58.729 --> 03:46:58.739 align:start position:0%
transfer station just can't pass that
 
03:46:58.739 --> 03:47:02.630 align:start position:0%
transfer station just can't pass that
test

03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.610 --> 03:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
and they happen to be on a collective
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining thing or a part of a union
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
would the employer be able to
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
make that change without violating the
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
CBA because they can't pass that test
 
03:47:15.170 --> 03:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
because of the implementation that we
 
03:47:15.180 --> 03:47:16.370 align:start position:0%
because of the implementation that we
did

03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:47:18.650 --> 03:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
so I mean again that's a highly specific
 
03:47:21.950 --> 03:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
example uh in a lot of instances I
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
believe there
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
I could see I see where your question is
 
03:47:27.889 --> 03:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
coming from I think a lot of times
 
03:47:30.650 --> 03:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
though that uh even within the confines
 
03:47:32.269 --> 03:47:32.279 align:start position:0%
of a collectively bargained agreement
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
there's some understanding that job
 
03:47:38.530 --> 03:47:38.540 align:start position:0%
duties might change and uh
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
again that's a very specific example I
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
can understand where the concern is
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:46.429 align:start position:0%
coming from
um

03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:48.590 --> 03:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
having dealt with collective bargaining
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
agreements and changes in the law I'm
 
03:47:54.530 --> 03:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
aware that if
 
03:47:57.290 --> 03:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
the laws change it makes something in
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement
 
03:48:01.849 --> 03:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
by in violation of a law
 
03:48:03.650 --> 03:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
that piece of the collective bargaining
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
agreement is null and void I'm happy to
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
remember back in when I was first
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
starting to negotiate teaching contracts
 
03:48:14.809 --> 03:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
um smoking was a was a thing in schools
 
03:48:17.090 --> 03:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
um and I was very grateful when the law
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
was passed saying smoking indoors will
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
not be a thing
 
03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and we've stopped filing grievances
 
03:48:25.610 --> 03:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
over teachers not being allowed to smoke
 
03:48:28.250 --> 03:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
so that was that was a happy day for me
 
03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
but I would suggest the same thing would
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
happen if there's something in a
 
03:48:33.769 --> 03:48:33.779 align:start position:0%
collective bar agreement or past
 
03:48:36.830 --> 03:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
practice that's in place that becomes in
 
03:48:38.830 --> 03:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
the safety standards
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
then the the standards would uh would
 
03:48:47.929 --> 03:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
would Trump the contract I would agree
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
with that I think where I'm somewhat
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
with representative avalani's question
 
03:48:53.330 --> 03:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
is I I do see that there could be
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios in which someone has a job
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
their job is in the CBA their their
 
03:49:02.330 --> 03:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
sjd's been approved and now you're
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
saying they might have to do this
 
03:49:06.050 --> 03:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
additional thing and if they can never
 
03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
do that additional thing what happens to
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
their position or what happens to their
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
their job and things of that nature
 
03:49:16.250 --> 03:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
those sometimes things like that I can
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
imagine coming out but that's a highly
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
specific example
 
03:49:21.769 --> 03:49:21.779 align:start position:0%
um I don't off the top of my head
 
03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
exactly know how that would uh
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
shake out typically the employer does
 
03:49:28.490 --> 03:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
have the wherewithal they have to meet
 
03:49:31.370 --> 03:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
their obligations with the law so
 
03:49:33.050 --> 03:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I believe there'd be some allowances
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:43.729 --> 03:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
the question that came up was cost as
 
03:49:43.739 --> 03:49:44.630 align:start position:0%
the question that came up was cost as
well

03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:49:47.450 --> 03:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
um there was thoughts of adding an FN to
 
03:49:49.969 --> 03:49:49.979 align:start position:0%
this for a
 
03:49:49.979 --> 03:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
this for a
um

03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:54.190 --> 03:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh sorry
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
adding a distribution of the general
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
fund to
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
um offset some of the costs some of
 
03:50:01.969 --> 03:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
these municipalities and towns would
 
03:50:01.979 --> 03:50:03.410 align:start position:0%
these municipalities and towns would
have

03:50:03.410 --> 03:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:50:03.420 --> 03:50:05.030 align:start position:0%
have
um

03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
we can't do that now
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
the department allocates some funds for
 
03:50:12.889 --> 03:50:12.899 align:start position:0%
educational materials and I know you
 
03:50:14.690 --> 03:50:14.700 align:start position:0%
approached that but and other materials
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
as well if they had to rewrite their
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
employee manuals to incorporate some of
 
03:50:20.690 --> 03:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
these standards or Personnel manuals
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.809 --> 03:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
be amenable to offsetting some of those
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
costs if the if there was a
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
process where they could say Hey you
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
know we don't know how to write these
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.130 --> 03:50:39.140 align:start position:0%
so we would certainly mean
 
03:50:41.570 --> 03:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
we would certainly be willing to assist
 
03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
any public employer in terms of doing
 
03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
that in terms of actually providing
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated services or costs we're not
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
presently uh or reimbursement you know
 
03:50:54.170 --> 03:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to hire someone to do it
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
were not presently set up to reimburse
 
03:50:58.849 --> 03:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
for those costs when I say not presently
 
03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
set up we don't have a budget line right
 
03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
now where I could basically have a
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
revolving fund saying okay submit your
 
03:51:07.870 --> 03:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures and you can be reimbursed
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
we do not have that that's not set up in
 
03:51:13.550 --> 03:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
our present budget in terms of providing
 
03:51:15.290 --> 03:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
assistance we'd be happy to provide
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
assistance uh if someone was asking you
 
03:51:20.210 --> 03:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
know for us to review things asking for
 
03:51:22.370 --> 03:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
suggestions or things of that nature but
 
03:51:24.170 --> 03:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
I understand that that's more informal
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
and not as comprehensive of what you're
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to but in terms of what
 
03:51:30.110 --> 03:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to we're not presently
 
03:51:33.769 --> 03:51:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
would we be able to
 
03:51:38.210 --> 03:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
um would the given that this is a budget
 
03:51:40.250 --> 03:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
year would the commissioner be able to
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:51:44.809 --> 03:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget if he was if this
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
plan was to come in and let's say we
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
were doing it in 24
 
03:51:50.210 --> 03:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
um would he be able to ask for a
 
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
revolving fund but maybe fund it with
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
um monies that the department takes in
 
03:51:57.889 --> 03:51:57.899 align:start position:0%
to a certain amount and you know be
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursable for 50 of your cost for
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
implementing this program or something
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
like that something like OSHA does when
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
they have their plan as they rebate some
 
03:52:07.490 --> 03:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the costs could the department do
 
03:52:10.729 --> 03:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.130 --> 03:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
I can ask I mean in terms of off-cycle
 
03:52:16.250 --> 03:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh setting up lines or new lines I can
 
03:52:19.309 --> 03:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
ask what the ability would be to do
 
03:52:22.130 --> 03:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
something like that I also don't know in
 
03:52:25.250 --> 03:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
terms of are you envisioning
 
03:52:28.370 --> 03:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
um you know reimbursement capped at a
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
certain amount or I guess I would want
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
to know perhaps more about the
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
parameters relative to it what I mean by
 
03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
that is is it something where they could
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
come in and say you know we need uh X
 
03:52:41.929 --> 03:52:41.939 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for for what so is it
 
03:52:44.050 --> 03:52:44.060 align:start position:0%
for any added costs is it for
 
03:52:47.050 --> 03:52:47.060 align:start position:0%
consultancy costs
 
03:52:49.370 --> 03:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
I would probably say just related to the
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
implementation of the program whether it
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
be employee manuals whether it be
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
offsetting some of the costs for larger
 
03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
purchases for safety equipment things
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
like that up to a certain amount that
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
the department would be willing to do
 
03:53:03.050 --> 03:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
that I mean if it's they could count for
 
03:53:05.929 --> 03:53:05.939 align:start position:0%
the ten thousand per town or ten
 
03:53:08.030 --> 03:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
thousand per department or you know a
 
03:53:09.530 --> 03:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand total or a million
 
03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
dollars total over the life of three
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
years or obviously we would
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
throw around some numbers down the road
 
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that would be
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
something that he would be interested in
 
03:53:23.690 --> 03:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
if you know where I'm going yeah I mean
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think we would need
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation like I said I will ask about
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh the uh whether through fiscal
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
Committee Action outside of the budget
 
03:53:37.250 --> 03:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
would it even be possible like next year
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
I can ask about that long term I
 
03:53:41.210 --> 03:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
ultimately think if you were going to
 
03:53:43.010 --> 03:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
try and set up some type of fun like
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
this you would want legislation to
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
basically say this is what the fund is
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is how it's funded this is how
 
03:53:53.090 --> 03:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
requests are made of the fund this is
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
how uh requests are processed so
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think you would want
 
03:53:59.570 --> 03:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
legislation for that but I I will ask
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
about this off cycle you know is this
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
something we could go to fiscal
 
03:54:07.490 --> 03:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know next year and say uh you know
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
can we move money from this line to this
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
newly established line I'm not sure what
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
the options are for doing that outside
 
03:54:16.130 --> 03:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
of the budget development that we're
 
03:54:18.170 --> 03:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
presently going through uh but I will
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
I know we've got someone here from
 
03:54:28.250 --> 03:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
um well I think has been trying to flag
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
down my attention we also have Susie
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
Nord here from National Kosh I know
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
she's brought some materials for the
 
03:54:37.809 --> 03:54:37.819 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
03:54:41.809 --> 03:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
do you have questions for the uh
 
03:54:41.819 --> 03:54:43.429 align:start position:0%
do you have questions for the uh
everybody

03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you go share Mike with uh
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.130 --> 03:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.510 --> 03:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't remember your name
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's okay um my name is Joyce Pittman
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of risk and benefits
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
with the Department of administrative
 
03:55:04.319 --> 03:55:05.450 align:start position:0%
with the Department of administrative
services

03:55:05.450 --> 03:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:55:08.570 --> 03:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
and as the service agency for all of the
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to just be really
 
03:55:15.050 --> 03:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
honest in this casual environment we
 
03:55:17.090 --> 03:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
would need to assess what that exactly
 
03:55:19.130 --> 03:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
means I think we have some state
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
agencies that are more advanced and what
 
03:55:23.570 --> 03:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about when we say OSHA and
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
we have others that aren't so I would
 
03:55:28.610 --> 03:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
have questions like who am I going to
 
03:55:30.650 --> 03:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
work with in agencies and I'm not saying
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
that we don't I'm not against any of
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
this employee safety we also run the
 
03:55:36.769 --> 03:55:36.779 align:start position:0%
workers compensation program for the
 
03:55:36.779 --> 03:55:37.490 align:start position:0%
workers compensation program for the
state

03:55:37.490 --> 03:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:55:39.889 --> 03:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
so anything that protects our employees
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're for it but we want to do it right
 
03:55:46.010 --> 03:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
and what I see is the Department of
 
03:55:47.929 --> 03:55:47.939 align:start position:0%
Labor is working this way
 
03:55:49.969 --> 03:55:49.979 align:start position:0%
to try to get us to ensure we're doing
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
it right and provide that consultancy
 
03:55:54.650 --> 03:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
and education but we want to be prepared
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
for them and we own that all of our
 
03:55:59.929 --> 03:55:59.939 align:start position:0%
agencies need to know okay I have this
 
03:55:59.939 --> 03:56:00.889 align:start position:0%
agencies need to know okay I have this
new

03:56:00.889 --> 03:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:56:03.050 --> 03:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh regulation I have to comply with
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
where am I now and where do I need to be
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
who am I going to dedicate for my staff
 
03:56:11.210 --> 03:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
to do it do I need to hire an external
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
consultant to come in and teach us
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
what do I need to do and when you were
 
03:56:17.689 --> 03:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
talking about the leeway I think that's
 
03:56:20.929 --> 03:56:20.939 align:start position:0%
a great question because I'm thinking
 
03:56:22.849 --> 03:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
the same thing but I'm thinking I'm not
 
03:56:24.650 --> 03:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
even sure what the municipalities have
 
03:56:26.689 --> 03:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
for Staffing to make this this needs to
 
03:56:29.210 --> 03:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
be a big deal you know it has to be a
 
03:56:32.210 --> 03:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
priority and I think we're all fairly
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
thinly staffed with people doing their
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
regular jobs to add this not that it's
 
03:56:39.889 --> 03:56:39.899 align:start position:0%
not important but they need to know what
 
03:56:42.050 --> 03:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're doing they need to have the
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
budget they need to do it strategically
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
so they're checking the boxes and then
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
working in conjunction with the
 
03:56:50.090 --> 03:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so we meet in the
 
03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:50.809 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor so we meet in the
middle

03:56:50.809 --> 03:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
middle
 
03:56:52.849 --> 03:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
do you know what I mean like we want we
 
03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to do it right we're going to raise
 
03:56:56.090 --> 03:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
the bar and get there what do you need
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
and then for us being the service agency
 
03:57:01.070 --> 03:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
what do our agencies need how far off
 
03:57:02.809 --> 03:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
are they some of them may have these
 
03:57:04.910 --> 03:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
harnesses some of them may not even
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
realize they have confined spaces
 
03:57:09.650 --> 03:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
isn't that a bigger challenge
 
03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
so and I think that's we do work with
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor now we do work
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
on these things so I don't think it's
 
03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
the wild west of unsafiness if that's a
 
03:57:20.570 --> 03:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
word out there but you're you're putting
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
more standards in place and we'd want to
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
do it right right and and I guess that
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
was the point I was thinking of making
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
is that it's not as if there's are no
 
03:57:30.769 --> 03:57:30.779 align:start position:0%
safety standards now correct um there
 
03:57:33.110 --> 03:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
are safety standards some of them are
 
03:57:36.290 --> 03:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
being sort of Unwritten safety standards
 
03:57:39.650 --> 03:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
um creates an unfair circumstance for
 
03:57:43.490 --> 03:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
any employer or employee if you if it's
 
03:57:45.050 --> 03:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
not written but you're expected to live
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
up to it because it's unsafe and it
 
03:57:49.370 --> 03:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
comes it would fall under the general
 
03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
duties Clause
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
um then um this should be a great help
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
to people and I think if we give some
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
lead-in time which I think is
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
I'm getting comfortable with that idea
 
03:58:04.969 --> 03:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
that would provide the agencies
 
03:58:07.010 --> 03:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
um the municipalities and so on with
 
03:58:08.929 --> 03:58:08.939 align:start position:0%
some time to work with the Department of
 
03:58:14.150 --> 03:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
Labor to work internally to figure all
 
03:58:16.689 --> 03:58:16.699 align:start position:0%
of this out and and again
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
knowing that we're working with our
 
03:58:20.450 --> 03:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
department of labor not somebody else's
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and knowing how they
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
operate that they come in and they
 
03:58:25.560 --> 03:58:26.710 align:start position:0%
operate that they come in and they
um

03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're a fixing organization not a you
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
know punishing organization so
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I I think we can make this work
 
03:58:39.769 --> 03:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
um especially with that lead-in time and
 
03:58:39.779 --> 03:58:40.429 align:start position:0%
um especially with that lead-in time and
um

03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I'm hopeful right and you see what I
 
03:58:45.530 --> 03:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
mean by coming in the middle like the
 
03:58:46.969 --> 03:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
agencies and the municipalities the
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
towns they have to figure out what's
 
03:58:50.689 --> 03:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
expected of them
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
rely on the Department of Labor to tell
 
03:58:55.010 --> 03:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
us what that is
 
03:58:57.650 --> 03:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
is that fair
 
03:59:00.769 --> 03:59:00.779 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that is one issue in
 
03:59:02.450 --> 03:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:59:04.910 --> 03:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
we are happy to try and work with anyone
 
03:59:06.889 --> 03:59:06.899 align:start position:0%
to educate them but we're not going to
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the opportunity to
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
give everyone here is everything and
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
explain what every what each piece of it
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
means how that oftentimes comes up now
 
03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
is in the context of you're doing a
 
03:59:22.010 --> 03:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
safety inspection you're like okay this
 
03:59:24.769 --> 03:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
was off but I that's why I would agree
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
with what um director Pittman is saying
 
03:59:28.610 --> 03:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:59:31.370 --> 03:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we're
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
we would not necessarily were not
 
03:59:35.150 --> 03:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
equipped to tell everyone and I don't
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
think we ever will be to tell everybody
 
03:59:40.010 --> 03:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
in every city in town here's what
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
everything means and here's how you're
 
03:59:45.530 --> 03:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
gonna do it and like so there'll be no
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
problems that just just hire another 300
 
03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
people yeah yeah
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
no so I think that's a great point is I
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and I also would say
 
03:59:54.840 --> 03:59:55.670 align:start position:0%
yeah and I also would say
um

03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:58.610 --> 03:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
there are agencies right now sorry there
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
are agencies right now that do have
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated safety staff in place
 
04:00:07.010 --> 04:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that are doing that other agencies
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
you are having it done more as a HR
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
function or a director of administration
 
04:00:15.410 --> 04:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
type function so it does differ and
 
04:00:17.150 --> 04:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
again I would defer um the
 
04:00:19.309 --> 04:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities I imagine is also
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat where some have like a whole
 
04:00:25.610 --> 04:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
safety sector and and some don't well I
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
would imagine that some agencies have
 
04:00:29.330 --> 04:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
fewer safety concerns
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
if most of your folks are office workers
 
04:00:31.319 --> 04:00:32.870 align:start position:0%
if most of your folks are office workers
then

04:00:32.870 --> 04:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:00:34.969 --> 04:00:34.979 align:start position:0%
there's not as much of a safety concern
 
04:00:37.969 --> 04:00:37.979 align:start position:0%
is if you're operating heavy equipment
 
04:00:39.410 --> 04:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think they're different
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and I think that um yeah there
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
are certain agencies where I would say
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
the host of our traffic at least
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:51.410 --> 04:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
and oddly if you look at our workers
 
04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
compensation claims our biggest offender
 
04:00:55.250 --> 04:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
or slips and false
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
yep that parking lot
 
04:01:01.490 --> 04:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.500 --> 04:01:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:01:03.229 --> 04:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
um the question I have is uh
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
the state does its own Bridge work on
 
04:01:12.349 --> 04:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
some bridges we all drive over them what
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
standards do they follow now
 
04:01:17.929 --> 04:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
so Department of Transportation I mean
 
04:01:20.090 --> 04:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
there are uh some other but I'll speak
 
04:01:21.290 --> 04:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
specifically the Department of
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh they do follow they
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
again they look at industry standards
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
best practices things of that nature
 
04:01:30.530 --> 04:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
they have dedicated safety compliance
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
folks if you talk to the folks from dot
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
they will tell you most of their folks
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
have some connection or background to
 
04:01:40.729 --> 04:01:40.739 align:start position:0%
OSHA the folks that they've hired are
 
04:01:42.469 --> 04:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
familiar with OSHA standards and that's
 
04:01:45.290 --> 04:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
typically what they're trying to apply
 
04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that most of
 
04:01:51.530 --> 04:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
this would hinge on dot employees and
 
04:01:53.929 --> 04:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
not really office workers per se
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
police fire have their own standards
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so in terms of I mean I think that
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
I would say I don't think that the 1910
 
04:02:09.650 --> 04:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
standards themselves are going to
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
present a whole host of like new added
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
complexity to the office environment the
 
04:02:16.969 --> 04:02:16.979 align:start position:0%
general office environment I would agree
 
04:02:19.250 --> 04:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
with that I would think that a lot of
 
04:02:19.260 --> 04:02:20.210 align:start position:0%
with that I would think that a lot of
the

04:02:20.210 --> 04:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:22.250 --> 04:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
um more Market changes are probably
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
related to work site type activities
 
04:02:29.809 --> 04:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that that's generally
 
04:02:31.729 --> 04:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
true and then with a lot of the
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities and stuff you're talking
 
04:02:35.210 --> 04:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
about they have tool sheds or different
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
tools they're working with where again
 
04:02:39.050 --> 04:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
we might see that in some of our
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
agencies they have you know where they
 
04:02:44.150 --> 04:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
have folks doing that type of work
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's probably where the the
 
04:02:47.809 --> 04:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
host of the impact is I don't think that
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's a huge Market change for the
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
general office worker
 
04:02:55.969 --> 04:02:55.979 align:start position:0%
and this will be my last one
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
um can I just add to that though when I
 
04:03:00.050 --> 04:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
said that we're over the state and I
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
said where the department of
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
administrative services I don't mean
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
that we only focus on the administrative
 
04:03:08.929 --> 04:03:08.939 align:start position:0%
services that are in agencies Das also
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
manages all of General services so we
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
are the facilities workers in all of the
 
04:03:15.530 --> 04:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
state-owned properties across the state
 
04:03:18.370 --> 04:03:18.380 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of different safety
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
implications of that type of work when
 
04:03:23.090 --> 04:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
you're doing the construction and and
 
04:03:24.769 --> 04:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
all of that involved in these buildings
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
so the from the facilities aspect you
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
would have on staff electricians you
 
04:03:30.650 --> 04:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
would have on staff plumbers you would
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
which also follow their own
 
04:03:36.110 --> 04:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
electrical code plumbing code HVAC and
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
everything else would the 1910 increase
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
those standards or would it be basically
 
04:03:43.849 --> 04:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
mirroring what's already in place
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
for us that's the analysis I would want
 
04:03:47.090 --> 04:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
to help them do
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I don't I can't answer I think yeah
 
04:03:49.800 --> 04:03:51.530 align:start position:0%
so I don't I can't answer I think yeah
there's

04:03:51.530 --> 04:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:03:53.570 --> 04:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
so typically again how an inspection
 
04:03:55.849 --> 04:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
would work now is if we went into a city
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
or town or a state agency and they and
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
they were doing their own electrical
 
04:04:01.610 --> 04:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
work and that's important because a lot
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
of times when we go into places they've
 
04:04:05.330 --> 04:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
hired a contractor and if the contractor
 
04:04:06.830 --> 04:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
is a private employer we're not doing
 
04:04:08.929 --> 04:04:08.939 align:start position:0%
that at all right but if we went into a
 
04:04:09.950 --> 04:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
place where they're doing their own
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
electrical work we would certainly
 
04:04:14.330 --> 04:04:14.340 align:start position:0%
leverage the electrical standard you
 
04:04:15.889 --> 04:04:15.899 align:start position:0%
know the standards for doing electrical
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
work we would look at that but then
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's more generalized what do you do
 
04:04:21.530 --> 04:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
on a work site what do you do like if
 
04:04:23.450 --> 04:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
you have things hanging what do you do
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
um that with 1910 I do think you're
 
04:04:29.450 --> 04:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
going to see some changes to those again
 
04:04:31.729 --> 04:04:31.739 align:start position:0%
more of the to Joyce's point about
 
04:04:34.429 --> 04:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
people doing work and construction yes
 
04:04:35.929 --> 04:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
there are go and when I say work in
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
construction not only building buildings
 
04:04:39.950 --> 04:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
but like yeah like putting up a wall or
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
digging a trench things like that I do
 
04:04:50.269 --> 04:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:52.490 --> 04:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
so I know I'm going over your time I'm
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
sorry the um so if you had a private
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
employer come in to do the same job that
 
04:04:59.450 --> 04:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
a public employer was doing right now
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
they would be held to two different
 
04:05:01.199 --> 04:05:02.689 align:start position:0%
they would be held to two different
standards

04:05:02.689 --> 04:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:05:05.809 --> 04:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
correct I mean if if we if we're going
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
to like a municipality and they've hired
 
04:05:10.670 --> 04:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
an electrician and the electrician is
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
not their employee that's not governed
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
by us the only time that sometimes it
 
04:05:18.050 --> 04:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
comes I'm not trying to get into the
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
weeds with this but if if the people who
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
work in the office are like going
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
through that job site we would look at
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
it and say okay that job site has to be
 
04:05:28.370 --> 04:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
in some way secure and safe for the
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
municipal workers working around it but
 
04:05:32.450 --> 04:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with the electrician
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's the private entity understood
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.090 --> 04:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
watching your time and knowing that uh
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
Ms Nord is here and just brought us some
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
materials would you uh like to address
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.060 --> 04:06:45.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:06:45.250 --> 04:06:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
TV or not
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we're being youtubed or
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
not maybe we are maybe we aren't all
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
right well
 
04:06:56.330 --> 04:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
um so basically what I did my
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
organization manages a list serve with
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
about 2 500
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienesis or people with you
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
know Public Health backgrounds
 
04:07:09.170 --> 04:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
especially the occupational aspect of it
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
and I put out a question about what does
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
it cost a public employer to implement a
 
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
health and safety program that would be
 
04:07:20.210 --> 04:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
OSHA compliant
 
04:07:22.670 --> 04:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
and there is no good answer for that for
 
04:07:24.530 --> 04:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
the reasons which have pretty much been
 
04:07:26.090 --> 04:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
04:07:28.130 --> 04:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
um it really depends on which employer
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about how far along they
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
already are what they're doing what you
 
04:07:34.010 --> 04:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
know what things they Outsource what
 
04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
things that they they do themselves so
 
04:07:39.769 --> 04:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
um I even went as far as speaking I've
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
tracked down a professor at the
 
04:07:45.130 --> 04:07:45.140 align:start position:0%
University of Indiana in Pennsylvania
 
04:07:47.929 --> 04:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
who did a report similar to the one that
 
04:07:49.450 --> 04:07:49.460 align:start position:0%
we did last summer
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
who did do some State information
 
04:07:55.969 --> 04:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
at the state level talking to their
 
04:07:58.210 --> 04:07:58.220 align:start position:0%
administrative Services probably
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
compatriots and
 
04:08:03.410 --> 04:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
chose a handful of departments
 
04:08:03.420 --> 04:08:04.429 align:start position:0%
chose a handful of departments
um

04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
she that report isn't publicly available
 
04:08:08.570 --> 04:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't able to get it but I will
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
say that there's a link on there that's
 
04:08:12.769 --> 04:08:12.779 align:start position:0%
not available online the one for the
 
04:08:15.410 --> 04:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts report there's a copy of
 
04:08:16.849 --> 04:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
it that I just gave representative
 
04:08:19.130 --> 04:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
Sullivan if anybody would like it my
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
email is on that paper there's a a
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
a table with maybe 10 15 examples of
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
injuries at the at a state department
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
one that they mentioned was a trip and
 
04:08:38.090 --> 04:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
fall and what the remedy would be under
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
OSHA and for example the trip and fall
 
04:08:41.809 --> 04:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
one I happen to remember it's kind of
 
04:08:43.729 --> 04:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
weird that you mentioned that was that
 
04:08:46.090 --> 04:08:46.100 align:start position:0%
they were recommended that they paint
 
04:08:48.410 --> 04:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
wherever the thing was that the person
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
tripped on so that the actual cost of
 
04:08:53.150 --> 04:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
remediation to be in compliance with
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
what OSHA would say they do was some
 
04:08:58.490 --> 04:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
paint and the time to paint it
 
04:08:58.500 --> 04:08:59.210 align:start position:0%
paint and the time to paint it
um

04:08:59.210 --> 04:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:01.370 --> 04:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how helpful that is in
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
terms of getting something actually
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
started however I do know that
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
I before I lived in Concord I lived in
 
04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
Candia which is your prototypical small
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
town we had a road agent I think most of
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
his projects if he couldn't do it were
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
subcontracted so then they weren't part
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
of this wouldn't be covered by this but
 
04:09:24.290 --> 04:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
I will say that we also because we were
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
such a small town and the selectman you
 
04:09:29.570 --> 04:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
know it's not a full-time job I was on
 
04:09:31.370 --> 04:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
the planning board I didn't know a whole
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
lot about planning until I became on the
 
04:09:36.050 --> 04:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
planning board but they we hire we sort
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
of have a contract with at that point it
 
04:09:39.650 --> 04:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
was Southern New Hampshire Planning
 
04:09:42.650 --> 04:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
Commission and I believe this is the
 
04:09:44.929 --> 04:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that select boards and
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
towns do if they're small like Candia is
 
04:09:50.990 --> 04:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association if you're a
 
04:09:52.610 --> 04:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
member of the municipal Association they
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
keep you up to date on changes that you
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
need to know about so that's part of how
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
Candia as a small town with very minimal
 
04:10:02.929 --> 04:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
budget very low taxes
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
um and we were proud and kept them that
 
04:10:04.319 --> 04:10:05.570 align:start position:0%
um and we were proud and kept them that
way

04:10:05.570 --> 04:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:10:07.370 --> 04:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
um but that's how we did it was that we
 
04:10:09.889 --> 04:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
had we had we spent the the money to
 
04:10:12.050 --> 04:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
just do the bare minimum that we needed
 
04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
to do and so
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
this for a town like Candia there might
 
04:10:19.010 --> 04:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
be some jump in what they would have to
 
04:10:21.229 --> 04:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
do but they're also so small they don't
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
even have a Department of Public Works
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
they have a road agent and truthfully I
 
04:10:27.530 --> 04:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
would be interested to know how a road
 
04:10:30.290 --> 04:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
agent is covered by this or not
 
04:10:30.300 --> 04:10:31.490 align:start position:0%
agent is covered by this or not
so

04:10:31.490 --> 04:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
um is he an employee of the town if he's
 
04:10:35.090 --> 04:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
an elected official so there's all kinds
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
of questions and I understand why you
 
04:10:40.130 --> 04:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
are all asking them
 
04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
I will say that if you want to get it
 
04:10:44.210 --> 04:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
get to a number you're never going to
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
get that number we could fund a study
 
04:10:48.889 --> 04:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
and somebody could go to all 400 towns
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
and cities how many school districts how
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
many public services like police fire
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
every state agency is that really going
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
to happen I don't think so and that's
 
04:11:00.650 --> 04:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
the only way to get the number so what
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
I've given you to get back to what I
 
04:11:04.849 --> 04:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
gave you was all of the financial
 
04:11:06.889 --> 04:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
information I was inundated with when I
 
04:11:08.570 --> 04:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
put this question out which doesn't
 
04:11:10.130 --> 04:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
actually answer that question but it
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
does tell you why this makes good fiscal
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
sense why it is good public policy why
 
04:11:18.530 --> 04:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's good for the employees and why you
 
04:11:21.050 --> 04:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
should ultimately be moving in this
 
04:11:23.570 --> 04:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
direction and I will defer to everybody
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
else's opinions on the other aspects but
 
04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
I did want to let you know that the cost
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
is the cost
 
04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
um if you do a cost benefit over the
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
life of the public entity it's going to
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
be a good investment
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
The Upfront cost it really depends on
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
what they're doing now and there's just
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
no way to know
 
04:11:44.640 --> 04:11:45.950 align:start position:0%
no way to know
so

04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
thanks a bunch
 
04:11:50.090 --> 04:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I just my watch just gave me a
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
message that said no I'm not we are on
 
04:11:55.610 --> 04:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
TV so um so someone who's watching on
 
04:11:58.010 --> 04:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
YouTube and informed me so
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
um but um uh thank you for the
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
information I will just point one thing
 
04:12:04.370 --> 04:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
out that I noticed right off there
 
04:12:07.729 --> 04:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
there's one of the the um uh links
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
refers to the benefits of the OSHA
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
on-site consultation program
 
04:12:13.969 --> 04:12:13.979 align:start position:0%
um which I understand is a great program
 
04:12:15.650 --> 04:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
but it does not come with this package
 
04:12:18.170 --> 04:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
no it does not however I wanted to make
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone knew what a great
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
idea it was and why we really should do
 
04:12:25.309 --> 04:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
that and I think it would answer a lot a
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues that we've had about
 
04:12:30.130 --> 04:12:30.140 align:start position:0%
startup costs and what the department
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
can do so
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
um but that's for another bill obviously
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
when we decided to do
 
04:12:39.769 --> 04:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
um oh just adopt OSHA standards rather
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
than create an OSHA state plan
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
um the consultancy program would have
 
04:12:45.849 --> 04:12:45.859 align:start position:0%
come with the
 
04:12:48.170 --> 04:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
OSHA state plan
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
um and basically we made a decision not
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
to go that route at this point I'm
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
predicting that somewhere down the line
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
whether it's two years five years or ten
 
04:12:56.939 --> 04:12:58.210 align:start position:0%
whether it's two years five years or ten
years

04:12:58.210 --> 04:12:58.220 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
someone will a white will go on in
 
04:13:04.010 --> 04:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
somebody's mind and says say isn't there
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
Federal money that comes with a state
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
plan the answer is yes and they'll say
 
04:13:10.610 --> 04:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we go after that and we'll see
 
04:13:12.110 --> 04:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
what the answer is to that question but
 
04:13:14.450 --> 04:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good start
 
04:13:14.460 --> 04:13:15.410 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good start
um

04:13:15.410 --> 04:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:18.729 --> 04:13:18.739 align:start position:0%
I I think the the one-year uh lead-in
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
will relieve a lot of anxiety allow a
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
lot of good things to happen over the
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
course of that year
 
04:13:27.969 --> 04:13:27.979 align:start position:0%
um and allow the department to work with
 
04:13:30.650 --> 04:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
employers allow the employers to work
 
04:13:32.809 --> 04:13:32.819 align:start position:0%
internally to figure out where they're
 
04:13:36.410 --> 04:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
going what they need to do and I think
 
04:13:38.809 --> 04:13:38.819 align:start position:0%
that that'll work out I'd like to hear
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
what other members of the subcommittee
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
given the
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
given the testimony and the amount of
 
04:13:56.150 --> 04:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.130 --> 04:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
better because it seems like there's a
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
large ramp up at DOL and then having to
 
04:14:02.269 --> 04:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
get it out all of the town cities and
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
state agencies
 
04:14:08.090 --> 04:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
I think representative Holcomb made a
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
good point that the fiscal year for
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
schools and uh
 
04:14:17.450 --> 04:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
that time schools and towns are
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah right it's uh July 1 so I think
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
putting it halfway through the year uh
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
would be awkward
 
04:14:28.130 --> 04:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
um so I I think you know having it
 
04:14:29.809 --> 04:14:29.819 align:start position:0%
Implement at the beginning of a fiscal
 
04:14:29.819 --> 04:14:31.130 align:start position:0%
Implement at the beginning of a fiscal
year

04:14:31.130 --> 04:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:14:33.650 --> 04:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
um might be better than having it uh
 
04:14:36.110 --> 04:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
Implement halfway through a fiscal year
 
04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh I frankly wouldn't feel awful about
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
it being a 60-day uh uh implementation
 
04:14:45.530 --> 04:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
because of the way our Department of
 
04:14:46.969 --> 04:14:46.979 align:start position:0%
Labor Works
 
04:14:48.410 --> 04:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
um people are not going to get whacked
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
over the head the minute uh on this
 
04:14:52.130 --> 04:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
takes effect
 
04:14:56.330 --> 04:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
um giving them a year to ramp up and and
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
um get ready uh everything sounds like a
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.439 --> 04:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
Cameron

04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
Cameron
 
04:15:08.880 --> 04:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
Cameron
um

04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:13.370 --> 04:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
what's that yes yes
 
04:15:14.809 --> 04:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
um Miss noord could you answer a
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
question for me
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
um Maine just did this a few years ago
 
04:15:19.319 --> 04:15:20.630 align:start position:0%
um Maine just did this a few years ago
yes

04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:22.969 --> 04:15:22.979 align:start position:0%
um do you know what their cost was to
 
04:15:25.490 --> 04:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
the towns and municipalities
 
04:15:27.530 --> 04:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
Maine is an interesting case because
 
04:15:29.929 --> 04:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
they already had so much of this in
 
04:15:32.809 --> 04:15:32.819 align:start position:0%
place before they actually went ahead
 
04:15:35.809 --> 04:15:35.819 align:start position:0%
and got OSHA compliant
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and so basically what they ended up
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
doing is I believe it was Governor
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
LePage is that the one that was in a few
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
years before the current governor he
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
looked somebody educated him and said so
 
04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
we're already doing this training we're
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
already doing all of the inspections
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're already doing all of these things
 
04:15:58.610 --> 04:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
why the heck are we not getting the
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
federal funding that we're entitled to
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
for doing this and so they took I know
 
04:16:04.490 --> 04:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
it took them a year or two because since
 
04:16:06.530 --> 04:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
they had a lot of regulations they had
 
04:16:08.150 --> 04:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
to sort of go back and forth and say
 
04:16:10.729 --> 04:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
Here's what Maine does here's what OSHA
 
04:16:13.729 --> 04:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
says how do you reconcile those
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
um and so there was some time in that
 
04:16:17.710 --> 04:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
but ultimately it saved them money
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
specifically they they had adopted the
 
04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
OSHA safety standards as we are
 
04:16:24.110 --> 04:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
attempting to do now they had done that
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
but they also had a bunch of other
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
things in place so they sort of
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
cherry-picked because they have a longer
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
history of putting in regulations sort
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
of piecemeal like something would come
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
up so they'd put in a standard that they
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
would enforce and so it happened sort of
 
04:16:43.849 --> 04:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
organically up to a point and then they
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
just sort of embraced the rest of the
 
04:16:47.929 --> 04:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
OSHA standards and then at a certain
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
point they were like well we're like 90
 
04:16:52.010 --> 04:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
of the way there let's take this last 10
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
percent and get the money and then what
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
they they did is they end up getting 50
 
04:16:57.889 --> 04:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
of what they were spending so it
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
actually saved them what 40 percent
 
04:17:02.570 --> 04:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
right so I can't put a dollar amount on
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm sorry I know that the Deputy
 
04:17:06.050 --> 04:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioner has been to Maine he might
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a better idea that than I do
 
04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
I need to go back to that 18 months
 
04:17:16.490 --> 04:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
versus the year the um
 
04:17:18.889 --> 04:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
the schools right now are putting
 
04:17:23.450 --> 04:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
together their budgets for the 24-25
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
20 23 24 year
 
04:17:30.110 --> 04:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so if we put this so that it becomes
 
04:17:33.290 --> 04:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
effective on July 1st of 2023 we're
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
already making them have to expend money
 
04:17:40.010 --> 04:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
that they didn't budget so I would think
 
04:17:42.110 --> 04:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
that this should really be
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
July of 2024 so that it can be properly
 
04:17:46.800 --> 04:17:51.410 align:start position:0%
July of 2024 so that it can be properly
budgeted

04:17:51.410 --> 04:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:53.570 --> 04:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
so these schools have pretty large
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance departments and some of
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
their maintenance departments are taken
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
care of
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the HVAC equipment the maintenance on
 
04:18:00.889 --> 04:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
the HVAC equipment as well as ball
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
fields but we just had our deliberative
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
session in Hillsboro for the
 
04:18:10.729 --> 04:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.650 --> 04:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
I think you got I think you got me lost
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
there on the dates
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
amazing myself yeah you you're
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
originally they were talking about July
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
of 24. okay that's a year that's the end
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
of the school year okay
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
I thought that's what we were talking
 
04:18:31.189 --> 04:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
about not not this July let me so the
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
budget we just put together was what
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2023 to June 30th 2024. so we
 
04:18:42.290 --> 04:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
have to make this effective after June
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
30th 2024 so
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
you're correct in that
 
04:18:51.110 --> 04:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
is that what you were thinking pardon I
 
04:18:53.210 --> 04:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
I want to do it before this group of
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
people is done yeah I want this I think
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
it should be in place when in this
 
04:19:01.250 --> 04:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
session and and I think
 
04:19:03.290 --> 04:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
if there are budgetary issues that that
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
come up that have can't be covered now
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
um the department will work with uh
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
school districts as they have in the
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
past to say if you don't have the money
 
04:19:14.330 --> 04:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
in your current budget to make this
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
adjustment we'll work with you but I'm
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable putting the entire thing
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
on hold for two years that's that's a
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
long haul
 
04:19:26.809 --> 04:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think they'll be okay if
 
04:19:29.210 --> 04:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
they can't make the appropriation until
 
04:19:32.870 --> 04:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um uh next year June of 24
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
um but I I think it's important to have
 
04:19:36.889 --> 04:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
these standards in place before that I
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
think give give folks a year
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:19:46.969 --> 04:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
with with the standards and if they need
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
more time to make Appropriations the
 
04:19:54.050 --> 04:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
department as we've heard will allow for
 
04:19:54.060 --> 04:19:55.429 align:start position:0%
department as we've heard will allow for
that

04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
increase in taxes
 
04:20:00.290 --> 04:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
I mean we're increasing taxes for our
 
04:20:02.990 --> 04:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
property for our for our residents we're
 
04:20:05.689 --> 04:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
increasing safety and by increasing
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
safety money is saved in the long run
 
04:20:10.610 --> 04:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's the OSHA does studies on this all
 
04:20:13.729 --> 04:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
the time and they find that their safety
 
04:20:13.739 --> 04:20:14.929 align:start position:0%
the time and they find that their safety
programs

04:20:14.929 --> 04:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:20:18.110 --> 04:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't cost money they save money
 
04:20:20.090 --> 04:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
Maybe not immediately
 
04:20:22.130 --> 04:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
but they do save money
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
did you want this to look 25 June of 25
 
04:20:27.830 --> 04:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
is that what you were thinking no I had
 
04:20:29.689 --> 04:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
you were correct I had my dates off as
 
04:20:31.490 --> 04:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
far as the the scheduling of which
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
budget was happening now versus then so
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
and and essentially what this bill will
 
04:20:39.229 --> 04:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
be signed into law
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
um if we get it past everything else
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
um in June of 2000 um
 
04:20:49.389 --> 04:20:49.399 align:start position:0%
23 23 which means it would take effect
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
in on June or July 1 of 2024. so it
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually does it does work it does work
 
04:20:56.760 --> 04:20:57.530 align:start position:0%
actually does it does work it does work
but

04:20:57.530 --> 04:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't disagree that that safety
 
04:21:03.410 --> 04:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not against
 
04:21:08.210 --> 04:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.849 --> 04:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
but to say we're not increasing taxes
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
because we're saving money because it's
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
reducing incidences and everything else
 
04:21:18.110 --> 04:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
that may be true in larger cities or in
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
different areas but it may not be true
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these small towns that don't
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of claims and they don't have
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of incidents so how are we you
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
know we're increasing taxes for those
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
towns to to adopt to the OSHA 1910
 
04:21:33.769 --> 04:21:33.779 align:start position:0%
standards well they may not have any
 
04:21:38.090 --> 04:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
claims or they may have minimal claims
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask because the comment
 
04:21:42.410 --> 04:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
was made that Maine was 90 there before
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
they adopted these standards can
 
04:21:45.710 --> 04:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
somebody in the room answer the question
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
where we think our municipalities are or
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
departments are
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
um in relation to that number
 
04:21:55.010 --> 04:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
nobody know we we're we're under the
 
04:21:58.969 --> 04:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor safety standards now
 
04:22:00.349 --> 04:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
um so essentially it's not that we have
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
no safety standards we have them some of
 
04:22:06.050 --> 04:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
them are unfortunately more vague than
 
04:22:07.790 --> 04:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
they should be some of them aren't
 
04:22:11.090 --> 04:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
written into this the rules at all and
 
04:22:13.849 --> 04:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
when challenged they fall back on the
 
04:22:18.410 --> 04:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
general duties Clause so do we I mean
 
04:22:21.110 --> 04:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
we have not adopted the OSHA standards
 
04:22:23.150 --> 04:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
Maine did
 
04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
I think what we're trying to do here is
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing Maine did so that
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
we can get up to the 90 percent
 
04:22:32.330 --> 04:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's not again that we don't
 
04:22:34.610 --> 04:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
have any safety standards we do
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to make it more
 
04:22:39.769 --> 04:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
specific more clear more fair so that
 
04:22:41.570 --> 04:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
um when
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
a an employer gets called on having
 
04:22:43.800 --> 04:22:45.309 align:start position:0%
a an employer gets called on having
unsafe

04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
conditions we're not falling back in the
 
04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
general duties to say
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
um it's just not safe and you should
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
have known better you can point to the
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
actual standard and say Here's the
 
04:22:58.610 --> 04:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
standard here's what it says
 
04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
specifically and here's how to um get uh
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
up to Snuff so I know Mark was thank you
 
04:23:07.199 --> 04:23:10.010 align:start position:0%
up to Snuff so I know Mark was thank you
Mike

04:23:10.010 --> 04:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I I did want to
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
put this discussion in context if I
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
might uh and again this is a maybe a
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
history lesson for some people but in
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
1993 Governor Greg at the time came to
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
laburn came to management and and
 
04:23:29.150 --> 04:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
basically said the the workers
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
compensation system is in trouble uh we
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
were at a place where nobody would write
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
insurance in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:23:36.769 --> 04:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
so he convened a group of people to get
 
04:23:36.779 --> 04:23:37.729 align:start position:0%
so he convened a group of people to get
together

04:23:37.729 --> 04:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
and from that came reforms to the
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
workers compensation system and this
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
speaks to the cost issue for employees
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
for employers
 
04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
and it's part of that that uh consensus
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh opinion that went forward to the
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
governor and that was eventually signed
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
there were some major changes made in
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the unemployed in the workers
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
compensation system that affected
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
workers in a very big way and lowered
 
04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
costs of communities number one was we
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
went from 66 and two-thirds when you
 
04:24:10.370 --> 04:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
were injured to 60 percent major change
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
we went from 350 weeks of duration of
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
benefits to 262 weeks for duration of
 
04:24:20.689 --> 04:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
benefits major change part of the deal
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
we we went to uh we went to managed care
 
04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
we went to uh return to work policies
 
04:24:29.090 --> 04:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
were put in place and part of the
 
04:24:31.610 --> 04:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
trade-off for that and in those who were
 
04:24:32.929 --> 04:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
around during that period of time and
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
keep reminding us every time we bring up
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
go from 60 to 66 and two-thirds they
 
04:24:40.610 --> 04:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
remind us that there was this deal was
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
cut part of that deal the Cornerstone of
 
04:24:44.929 --> 04:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
that deal for labor was that we have
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive safety and health programs
 
04:24:50.689 --> 04:24:50.699 align:start position:0%
within our within our workplaces we
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
traded off big to get these kinds of
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
programs so when employers say that
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about the cost
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
we're paying for that the employees are
 
04:25:03.530 --> 04:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
funding many of the costs of those
 
04:25:05.929 --> 04:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
safety and health programs with reduced
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
benefits major savings for employment
 
04:25:10.969 --> 04:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
now I can't I can't put a number on that
 
04:25:12.769 --> 04:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you having served in the
 
04:25:15.110 --> 04:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
workers compensation appeals board
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
um for more than 20 years
 
04:25:18.769 --> 04:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
there were many cases there were
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars that I
 
04:25:22.729 --> 04:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
saw over the course of the years
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
or major savings to employers
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that needs to be taken into
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
consideration entered into the record so
 
04:25:31.610 --> 04:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
what we were asking for at the time we
 
04:25:33.769 --> 04:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
want a safe workplace and I was looking
 
04:25:35.809 --> 04:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
at a report that come out
 
04:25:35.819 --> 04:25:36.349 align:start position:0%
at a report that come out
um

04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:38.990 --> 04:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
from the monthly labor review and they
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
also said at the time that there and I
 
04:25:42.530 --> 04:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
didn't remember this but there was also
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
a safety incentive program in which the
 
04:25:47.929 --> 04:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
uh was supposed to be a discount from
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
the on the insurers if there was a
 
04:25:52.729 --> 04:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
safety health program in place
 
04:25:55.370 --> 04:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
and that was uh and that was noted in
 
04:25:57.769 --> 04:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
the in the main so what I one of the
 
04:25:59.090 --> 04:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
things that I'd like to know is in fact
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
are these incentives being translated
 
04:26:04.250 --> 04:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
into reduced costs to the employees at
 
04:26:07.010 --> 04:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
the time uh so that's a major I just
 
04:26:08.210 --> 04:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that goes on the
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
record and let me just say one other
 
04:26:11.570 --> 04:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
thing we stopped as a Department of
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
Labor asking for certificates of
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
compliance we only required them to do
 
04:26:19.010 --> 04:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
it once uh it used to be every year they
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
had to file a certificates that they
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
were in compliance uh with the law we we
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
did away with that so they only have to
 
04:26:28.010 --> 04:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
file one slip now I did I pulled
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County uh I went right to
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
Nolo I pulled their plan uh they haven't
 
04:26:34.130 --> 04:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
filed anything with the Department of
 
04:26:35.570 --> 04:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
Labor for years because they had they
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
did one time uh and I'm looking now for
 
04:26:40.130 --> 04:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
the other departments which in
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County because I don't know
 
04:26:43.910 --> 04:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
where the safety plans are for the for a
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
number of different departments within
 
04:26:47.809 --> 04:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County so I don't know if
 
04:26:49.309 --> 04:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
you guys I don't know if the ball was
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
dropped uh I don't know how much
 
04:26:53.149 --> 04:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
oversight there is in these safe in
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
health programs now but it was an
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
important component for employees and we
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
gave up a whole lot of stuff to get to
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
where we are so that's what I'm I just
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
we need to say that we need to
 
04:27:05.090 --> 04:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
understand what happened thank you Mr
 
04:27:05.100 --> 04:27:09.490 align:start position:0%
understand what happened thank you Mr
chairman

04:27:09.490 --> 04:27:09.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.929 --> 04:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
I got to tell you I'm a little befuddled
 
04:27:14.939 --> 04:27:16.790 align:start position:0%
I got to tell you I'm a little befuddled
today

04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:27:19.610 --> 04:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
I'm befuddled at the lack of people here
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
in the audience of the subcommittee
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
because of all the complaints about the
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
cost that this was going to bring
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
and there's no one here to talk about
 
04:27:29.929 --> 04:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's no one here a young lady of the
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
municipal Association left well where
 
04:27:36.769 --> 04:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
have you you have a pro you know if you
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
have something to say don't sit there if
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with the cost
 
04:27:43.610 --> 04:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
associated with this for your members
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
um that seemed to be the the big little
 
04:27:48.110 --> 04:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
Abalone representative Abalone and I
 
04:27:50.090 --> 04:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
were talking about this you talk about
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
it representative colcum is this a 28a
 
04:27:53.689 --> 04:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
issue what's the deal what's this going
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
to cost it's going to cost hundreds of
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for the bigger
 
04:27:56.399 --> 04:27:59.570 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for the bigger
cities

04:27:59.570 --> 04:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
I guess no one has a problem with the
 
04:28:00.960 --> 04:28:04.610 align:start position:0%
I guess no one has a problem with the
cost

04:28:04.610 --> 04:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.620 --> 04:28:06.649 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:28:06.649 --> 04:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:28:09.170 --> 04:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
um your choice
 
04:28:11.090 --> 04:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
um this is an open forum for everyone to
 
04:28:13.969 --> 04:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
speak but I've heard Zippo
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the cost associated
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
with this and and uh I'm just kind of
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
surprised I think it's a I think is a
 
04:28:25.849 --> 04:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
game going on uh in in with lobbyists uh
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
and conquered right now
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
um that they really don't care what's
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the house because
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have any faith in it so we'll
 
04:28:34.250 --> 04:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
just deal with it in the Senate uh the
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
the amount of people who've come and
 
04:28:38.210 --> 04:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
testify in front of us is the smallest
 
04:28:40.250 --> 04:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
amount I've ever seen at any years I've
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
been in this committee so I guess
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's not an issue here if you want to
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
speak you're welcome to speak but
 
04:28:47.210 --> 04:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
apparently there there doesn't seem to
 
04:28:48.889 --> 04:28:48.899 align:start position:0%
be any Hue and cry if there's a
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
financial issue associated with this
 
04:28:50.640 --> 04:28:56.170 align:start position:0%
financial issue associated with this
bill

04:28:56.170 --> 04:28:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I provided a letter last night
 
04:29:01.370 --> 04:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
that was in follow-up to my testimony
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
from the hearing
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
um relative to the cost and that was
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
received okay excellent
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I just want to touch on a couple of
 
04:29:10.670 --> 04:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
things because one of the issues that
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
was asked during the hearing was whether
 
04:29:15.649 --> 04:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
a reduction in workers comp claims could
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
sort of offset any cost that
 
04:29:20.030 --> 04:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities would see in response to
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
this bill being filed and so what I did
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
was I reached out to primex which is the
 
04:29:28.610 --> 04:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
prime main insurer of workers comp for
 
04:29:31.370 --> 04:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
schools counties Village districts towns
 
04:29:31.380 --> 04:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
schools counties Village districts towns
cities

04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
cities
 
04:29:34.729 --> 04:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
Etc to find out
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
any anecdotal information or data they
 
04:29:41.090 --> 04:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
could give me about that and exactly the
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
same as what was stated previously by
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
Services the primary driver or the
 
04:29:49.010 --> 04:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
primary cost of workers comp claims
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
relates actually to slip and Falls which
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
usually has to do with Footwear choices
 
04:29:55.370 --> 04:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
and rushing and carrying things that are
 
04:29:56.450 --> 04:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
too much and that was the information
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
that I got from primex so they were not
 
04:30:01.610 --> 04:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
able to give me information that would
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
show that this would decrease workers
 
04:30:06.290 --> 04:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
comp claims enough to offset the initial
 
04:30:09.410 --> 04:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
cost of getting up into compliance I'm
 
04:30:12.170 --> 04:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
not able to give the subcommittee any
 
04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
specific cost as I was not able to do
 
04:30:17.090 --> 04:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
during the hearing as well but what I
 
04:30:19.849 --> 04:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
understand the costs would be compliance
 
04:30:22.130 --> 04:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
costs could be legal costs it could be
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
hiring additional staff there's been
 
04:30:27.170 --> 04:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
reference to small towns who would they
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
designate as the safety person or the
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
safety officers many of them might need
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
to hire additional staff in order to do
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
that there could be legal costs there
 
04:30:38.330 --> 04:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
could be costs relative to
 
04:30:40.610 --> 04:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades or Acquisitions
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
in order to come into compliance with
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
1910 and so there's just a Litany of
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
costs that we know would be incurred we
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
just can't give specific numbers on what
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
those would be until after coming into
 
04:30:56.809 --> 04:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
compliance has occurred I appreciate the
 
04:30:59.510 --> 04:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
conversation of the subcommittee talking
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
about delaying the effective date in
 
04:31:06.530 --> 04:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
order to educate or to bring along the
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
public sector with respect to the 1910
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
standards and there's been conversation
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
by the subcommittee about how an
 
04:31:16.570 --> 04:31:16.580 align:start position:0%
investment in safety in the Long View
 
04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
can lead to decrease in costs and
 
04:31:22.010 --> 04:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
obviously benefits to public sector
 
04:31:22.020 --> 04:31:23.530 align:start position:0%
obviously benefits to public sector
employees

04:31:23.530 --> 04:31:23.540 align:start position:0%
employees
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
I can't disagree with that but I would
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that state implementation of
 
04:31:31.490 --> 04:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
State policy should come along with
 
04:31:34.250 --> 04:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
State investment in that policy to make
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
it done right to make it effective and
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
to make it last and so so there's been
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
some conversation in this subcommittee
 
04:31:43.010 --> 04:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
this morning as well or this afternoon
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
we've hit the afternoon
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
um about the idea of a fund that would
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
defray costs or something along those
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
lines and that gets closer to where we
 
04:31:55.729 --> 04:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
would need to be to ensure that our
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
cities and towns especially the smallest
 
04:32:00.530 --> 04:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
ones can come into compliance I
 
04:32:02.450 --> 04:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
appreciated the testimony this morning
 
04:32:05.929 --> 04:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
about how a small town like Candia would
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
look to the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:32:10.130 --> 04:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
Association to keep them updated on
 
04:32:13.610 --> 04:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
changes in the law I can say that nhma
 
04:32:15.769 --> 04:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
would be happy to be able to provide
 
04:32:17.570 --> 04:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
this kind of comprehensive guidance to
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
our members but this is a complex expert
 
04:32:23.450 --> 04:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
area and there's only so much we can do
 
04:32:25.370 --> 04:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
with the general guidance we provide to
 
04:32:28.130 --> 04:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
all 234 cities and towns as well as the
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
village districts and many of the
 
04:32:32.809 --> 04:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
counties so that is really a reiteration
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the letter that I submitted I did try
 
04:32:37.070 --> 04:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
to look into some of those items for the
 
04:32:39.769 --> 04:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
committee and those continue to be our
 
04:32:39.779 --> 04:32:41.870 align:start position:0%
committee and those continue to be our
concerns

04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:32:44.929 --> 04:32:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so in my
 
04:32:47.520 --> 04:32:48.769 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so in my
understanding

04:32:48.769 --> 04:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly that the
 
04:32:55.250 --> 04:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
largest number slip and false and
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the large number of claims and
 
04:32:59.330 --> 04:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
money so is that saying then that we
 
04:33:01.969 --> 04:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
really have a small percentage of other
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
incidents reported to that
 
04:33:08.330 --> 04:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't want to cut you off
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know the answer to that I
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
just tried to get a sense for if these
 
04:33:17.090 --> 04:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
if additional standards like the 1910
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
standards went into effect would that
 
04:33:19.320 --> 04:33:20.631 align:start position:0%
standards went into effect would that
really

04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
um address the Lion's Share of claims
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
that drive workers comp costs and the
 
04:33:28.250 --> 04:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
response I got to that was no as far as
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
more granular data about well how does
 
04:33:33.131 --> 04:33:33.141 align:start position:0%
it break down then and how would
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
increase or expanded standards affect
 
04:33:38.449 --> 04:33:38.459 align:start position:0%
the different types of claims we see I
 
04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't have that kind of specific data to
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
where there isn't one I mean in maybe
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
doing it in smaller steps might be
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
easier I mean is is there a specific
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:59.929 --> 04:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
the I would say the reason we're doing
 
04:34:02.449 --> 04:34:02.459 align:start position:0%
this is because we want to have the
 
04:34:05.269 --> 04:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
specific safety standards that are being
 
04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
often you um put in place through the
 
04:34:09.650 --> 04:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
general duties Clause
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
um as part of New Hampshire
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
um uh statute because
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner during our study
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
committee readily acknowledged that
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
there are substantial gaps in the um
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor safety standards and
 
04:34:30.349 --> 04:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
that those safety standards have not
 
04:34:31.970 --> 04:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
been updated
 
04:34:31.980 --> 04:34:32.631 align:start position:0%
been updated
um

04:34:32.631 --> 04:34:32.641 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:35.209 --> 04:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
in any of the 10 years that he's been
 
04:34:39.529 --> 04:34:39.539 align:start position:0%
here so we were we were due to be
 
04:34:39.539 --> 04:34:42.830 align:start position:0%
here so we were we were due to be
um

04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
fix our safety standards and the the
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
most effective way of fixing it in the
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
opinion of the study committee was to
 
04:34:54.250 --> 04:34:54.260 align:start position:0%
adopt the OSHA standards which over time
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
will be reviewed that's what OSHA does
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
every year they review their standards
 
04:35:01.609 --> 04:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
and as they get reviewed and updated
 
04:35:03.769 --> 04:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
rather than New Hampshire having to do
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
it which we haven't
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
um OSHA will do it and we we have uh by
 
04:35:11.570 --> 04:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
Statute adopted the OSHA standards we
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
will have updated standards every year
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
as I as I said I think earlier in some
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
of our hearings you know I've
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
in some I I'm I'm for the safety I mean
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
I come from the construction industry I
 
04:35:28.609 --> 04:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of it I
 
04:35:30.289 --> 04:35:30.299 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe that we should be
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
making sure everybody goes home every
 
04:35:35.090 --> 04:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
day in one piece
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
um but I'm wondering if we aren't
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
biting off more than we can chew in this
 
04:35:42.410 --> 04:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
one bill and I'm saying that only
 
04:35:45.170 --> 04:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm new so with me being a
 
04:35:47.810 --> 04:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
first-time rep and having not read the
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
entire 1133 pages that was sent to me
 
04:35:52.250 --> 04:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
I'll admit to that
 
04:35:53.570 --> 04:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm wondering if if we're
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
taking too big of a step on this and if
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
maybe we should do this in increments
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think with the study committee
 
04:36:02.890 --> 04:36:02.900 align:start position:0%
concluded was that too big a step was to
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
take on the state plant
 
04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
um in that basically let's take a
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
smaller bite and adopt the safety
 
04:36:14.449 --> 04:36:14.459 align:start position:0%
standards let our department of labor
 
04:36:14.459 --> 04:36:15.170 align:start position:0%
standards let our department of labor
um

04:36:15.170 --> 04:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
implement it and oversee it
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
we won't really interact with OSHA
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
directly we'll interact with the
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that we're used to
 
04:36:28.131 --> 04:36:28.141 align:start position:0%
and frankly as we've been discussing all
 
04:36:28.141 --> 04:36:28.990 align:start position:0%
and frankly as we've been discussing all
afternoon

04:36:28.990 --> 04:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
04:36:31.010 --> 04:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:36:31.020 --> 04:36:32.830 align:start position:0%
who are
um

04:36:32.830 --> 04:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:35.929 --> 04:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
involved in fixing safety standards not
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
punishing safety violations and so
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
essentially we'll have the standards
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have a department that acts uh
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
reasonably with public employers but I
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
don't know how you pick and choose which
 
04:36:50.929 --> 04:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
safety standards are more important than
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
other other safety standards we
 
04:36:56.570 --> 04:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
presently have no electrical standards
 
04:36:58.849 --> 04:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
in the department of labor standards
 
04:37:00.890 --> 04:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
nothing for electricity
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
so well
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
but but to to choose that over
 
04:37:07.730 --> 04:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
everything else I I don't know how to
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
that I can do that so
 
04:37:09.840 --> 04:37:11.150 align:start position:0%
that I can do that so
um

04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:14.330 --> 04:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
basically we did decide to go light and
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
not do the state plan
 
04:37:16.439 --> 04:37:17.029 align:start position:0%
not do the state plan
um

04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:19.010 --> 04:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's not I want to do the state plan
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're not and then I'm okay with that I
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
think this will work
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm also conscious of the fact that
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
we're past 2 30 and we've got another
 
04:37:27.959 --> 04:37:29.209 align:start position:0%
we're past 2 30 and we've got another
study

04:37:29.209 --> 04:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm not study but uh subcommittee
 
04:37:33.289 --> 04:37:33.299 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to start at 230. I would
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
suggest though that we've not reached a
 
04:37:36.299 --> 04:37:37.250 align:start position:0%
suggest though that we've not reached a
conclusion

04:37:37.250 --> 04:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
I think we're moving towards one but I
 
04:37:40.970 --> 04:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
think another meeting of this
 
04:37:44.570 --> 04:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be prudent so that
 
04:37:44.580 --> 04:37:46.070 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be prudent so that
we

04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:37:48.289 --> 04:37:48.299 align:start position:0%
can finish her work and I suggest that
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
we set that time uh now so that we can
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
put it on the record people who have an
 
04:37:56.929 --> 04:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
interest will know of it be um because
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh if it's going to be next week it
 
04:38:00.650 --> 04:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
won't be in the calendar it only
 
04:38:02.689 --> 04:38:02.699 align:start position:0%
requires 24-hour notice but I'd like to
 
04:38:04.849 --> 04:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit broader notice in
 
04:38:04.859 --> 04:38:08.810 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit broader notice in
that

04:38:08.810 --> 04:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I might yes to
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
 
04:38:17.209 --> 04:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
this was they were actually
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
three different parts of OSHA
 
04:38:23.631 --> 04:38:23.641 align:start position:0%
compliance that we could have enacted
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
and then the biggest one which is the
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
full vote
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
which representative Sullivan and I
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
disagree on on going that route but the
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
three things picking this General
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
conditions was about as minimal a step
 
04:38:38.689 --> 04:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
we could go to some would say we didn't
 
04:38:40.609 --> 04:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
do enough
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
um this was a great way to take the
 
04:38:46.609 --> 04:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor who hadn't updated
 
04:38:49.310 --> 04:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
their things in 10 years
 
04:38:52.131 --> 04:38:52.141 align:start position:0%
um a very uh simple step
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and one of the least we thought at
 
04:38:54.840 --> 04:38:56.390 align:start position:0%
um and one of the least we thought at
least

04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
least
 
04:38:58.369 --> 04:38:58.379 align:start position:0%
um obtrusive
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
to people that it would affect Mr
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
chairman if I might ask the the
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
individual um who who testified just now
 
04:39:05.279 --> 04:39:06.890 align:start position:0%
individual um who who testified just now
question

04:39:06.890 --> 04:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
what I would like to know
 
04:39:10.910 --> 04:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
is if the municipal Association is
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
against this bill passing as is with the
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
time frames that we've outlined I'd like
 
04:39:18.609 --> 04:39:18.619 align:start position:0%
to know
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
specifically why and what you would do
 
04:39:23.449 --> 04:39:23.459 align:start position:0%
to make it palatable
 
04:39:25.490 --> 04:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to have an answer
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
right now but in if if you're if you're
 
04:39:31.369 --> 04:39:31.379 align:start position:0%
if right now you are as an organization
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
talking to your members and they're
 
04:39:35.449 --> 04:39:35.459 align:start position:0%
saying we do not want this past and
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to Lobby against this to
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
other state representatives I'd like to
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
know why and if there's anything we can
 
04:39:42.288 --> 04:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
do to fix that
 
04:39:48.650 --> 04:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
I think policy positions that are
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
adopted by its membership every two
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
years we have like a town meeting where
 
04:39:57.650 --> 04:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
we adopt our policy positions
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
um but we also have a 25 member board of
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
directors made up of local officials and
 
04:40:04.970 --> 04:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
we take specific bills to our board of
 
04:40:06.410 --> 04:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
directors including when bills are
 
04:40:08.448 --> 04:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
amended or changed to discuss the issues
 
04:40:11.630 --> 04:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
with our board and to discuss specific
 
04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
positions on bills if they don't fit
 
04:40:16.730 --> 04:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
neatly within our policies or if the
 
04:40:18.650 --> 04:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill has potentially been amended to
 
04:40:21.230 --> 04:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
make it better than it was for us than
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
when it was originally filed so I am
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
happy to bring this bill to my board and
 
04:40:29.930 --> 04:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's actually already on our agenda for
 
04:40:29.940 --> 04:40:31.250 align:start position:0%
it's actually already on our agenda for
tomorrow

04:40:31.250 --> 04:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.330 --> 04:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
look looking at a future meeting uh
 
04:40:41.090 --> 04:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
what is our time frame Mr chairman for
 
04:40:41.100 --> 04:40:42.770 align:start position:0%
what is our time frame Mr chairman for
uh

04:40:42.770 --> 04:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:45.050 --> 04:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
our time frame is
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
um the third week of March we have to
 
04:40:50.208 --> 04:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
have our final executive session to get
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
rid of our remaining four pieces of
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislation from the labor committee
 
04:40:56.630 --> 04:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
I don't want to wait to the last week no
 
04:41:00.530 --> 04:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
but that is our drop dead deadline
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
um looking at next week we we've got I
 
04:41:04.190 --> 04:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to do it anytime before
 
04:41:06.890 --> 04:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
Thursday because there's going to be all
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
the build up to a massive two-day
 
04:41:09.958 --> 04:41:10.868 align:start position:0%
the build up to a massive two-day
session

04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:41:14.090 --> 04:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
and which would leave only Friday
 
04:41:16.010 --> 04:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a stomach for
 
04:41:18.050 --> 04:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee meeting on a
 
04:41:18.060 --> 04:41:18.830 align:start position:0%
having a subcommittee meeting on a
Friday

04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
is anyone here in this room
 
04:41:23.090 --> 04:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
participating here going to be away
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
that makes more sense then well I mean
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
some people may not be here but um
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me they can watch or they can
 
04:41:42.050 --> 04:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
bring people here you're right I don't
 
04:41:45.288 --> 04:41:45.298 align:start position:0%
want to do a marathon two days next week
 
04:41:46.970 --> 04:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
plus a Friday
 
04:41:49.730 --> 04:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
I would rather do it the week after and
 
04:41:51.650 --> 04:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not mistaken representative
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
abalani uh uh Monday through Wednesday
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
are not as easy as Thursday correct
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
how about we do Thursday next uh the
 
04:42:01.920 --> 04:42:05.930 align:start position:0%
how about we do Thursday next uh the
second

04:42:05.930 --> 04:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.940 --> 04:42:08.810 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:42:08.810 --> 04:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.820 --> 04:42:09.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:42:09.650 --> 04:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:09.660 --> 04:42:13.310 align:start position:0%
um
time

04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:24.110 --> 04:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
morning's open why don't we do 10
 
04:42:27.530 --> 04:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
o'clock where is is 10 good
 
04:42:27.540 --> 04:42:29.208 align:start position:0%
o'clock where is is 10 good
Lino

04:42:29.208 --> 04:42:29.218 align:start position:0%
Lino
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:33.718 --> 04:42:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:42:36.910 --> 04:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.530 --> 04:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:45.540 --> 04:42:47.770 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:42:47.770 --> 04:42:47.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:51.770 --> 04:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:51.780 --> 04:42:53.448 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:42:53.448 --> 04:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:41.638 --> 04:50:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
so we had this amendment drawn up
 
04:50:32.690 --> 04:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
we received information from an attorney
 
04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
who went through the um the bill and she
 
04:50:39.410 --> 04:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
proposed some ways to make it
 
04:50:39.420 --> 04:50:41.628 align:start position:0%
proposed some ways to make it
better

04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:50:43.550 --> 04:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
and of course now I can't find her thing
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.330 --> 04:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
she pointed out that when in the
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:50:55.010 --> 04:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
that we should prevent any employment
 
04:50:57.910 --> 04:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination including demotions
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
reduced hours reduced pay not just
 
04:51:03.770 --> 04:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
termination based on a registered
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
patient's use of medical cannabis and
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
second the language should be clarified
 
04:51:11.208 --> 04:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
to ensure a person who is registered as
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
a patient cannot be punished for either
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
for their status as a patient or for
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
testing positive
 
04:51:21.530 --> 04:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
so those things are addressed in the
 
04:51:21.540 --> 04:51:24.110 align:start position:0%
so those things are addressed in the
amendment

04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.810 --> 04:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
the third the third point that she she
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
was making was that where the drug
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
screening tests are required for the
 
04:51:32.448 --> 04:51:32.458 align:start position:0%
safety of persons and property at the
 
04:51:35.330 --> 04:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
job site should be eliminated because
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
testing for metabolites is not ever
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
necessary for the safety of a person on
 
04:51:43.128 --> 04:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
the job site and she she went on to
 
04:51:46.788 --> 04:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
state that this is not in Statute in
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
other states that have these types of
 
04:51:48.480 --> 04:51:49.610 align:start position:0%
other states that have these types of
protection

04:51:49.610 --> 04:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that would make it a unique carve out
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
04:51:55.080 --> 04:51:56.030 align:start position:0%
I believe that
um

04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:57.890 --> 04:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
that we might even shoot ourselves in
 
04:51:59.810 --> 04:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
the foot if we left that Clause the way
 
04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
it is now I'm confused on that point uh
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
what what is not in other statutes and
 
04:52:07.788 --> 04:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
which foot are we shooting
 
04:52:07.798 --> 04:52:10.510 align:start position:0%
which foot are we shooting
foreign

04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:14.330 --> 04:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
I am on the wrong part
 
04:52:14.340 --> 04:52:17.390 align:start position:0%
I am on the wrong part
um

04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:20.448 --> 04:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
could you restate the question
 
04:52:23.090 --> 04:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
you said something about a piece of this
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
is not in the statute in other states
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which piece you are
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.490 --> 04:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not looking right at it now
 
04:52:53.448 --> 04:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
testing I'm going to go ahead and read
 
04:52:56.810 --> 04:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
what she said
 
04:52:56.820 --> 04:52:58.128 align:start position:0%
what she said
um

04:52:58.128 --> 04:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
testing for metabolites
 
04:53:03.410 --> 04:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
is not ever necessary for the safety of
 
04:53:05.930 --> 04:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
a person at a job site metabolites do
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
not show a person is impaired and they
 
04:53:11.090 --> 04:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
stay in one system for 30 days Most
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
states do not have any similar exception
 
04:53:17.930 --> 04:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
to the to those words in the bill where
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
it says wear drug screening tests are
 
04:53:22.550 --> 04:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
required for the safety of persons and
 
04:53:25.128 --> 04:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
property at the job site and she
 
04:53:27.948 --> 04:53:27.958 align:start position:0%
suggested that should be eliminated and
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what the one of the things
 
04:53:31.610 --> 04:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
that the amendment does is eliminate
 
04:53:36.770 --> 04:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
she had a final Point as well about the
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
amendment and that was that there should
 
04:53:44.570 --> 04:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
be explicit exception for if negative
 
04:53:48.110 --> 04:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
action is required by federal law or
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
regulations a federal contract or
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements
 
04:53:57.470 --> 04:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
and so we added that to the end where it
 
04:53:59.448 --> 04:53:59.458 align:start position:0%
says this section shall not apply in
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
cases where this limit conflicts with
 
04:54:04.128 --> 04:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
the employer's obligations under federal
 
04:54:08.570 --> 04:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:10.670 --> 04:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
to fulfill a federal contractor
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
licensing obligation
 
04:54:16.730 --> 04:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
and then it see nothing in this section
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to require an
 
04:54:20.690 --> 04:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
employer to allow being impaired by
 
04:54:23.208 --> 04:54:23.218 align:start position:0%
cannabis products while at work
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
so basically I the way I see the
 
04:54:26.810 --> 04:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it clarifies some of
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
the language that would be using in the
 
04:54:32.810 --> 04:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
bill that we want to we want to avoid
 
04:54:32.820 --> 04:54:35.330 align:start position:0%
bill that we want to we want to avoid
um

04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.448 --> 04:54:38.458 align:start position:0%
we want to we avoid redundancy but we
 
04:54:41.208 --> 04:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
also want to look at we want to look at
 
04:54:41.218 --> 04:54:42.110 align:start position:0%
also want to look at we want to look at
um

04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
any employment discrimination not just
 
04:54:49.250 --> 04:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
not being hired or being fired which is
 
04:54:55.910 --> 04:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
the second the second part being that a
 
04:55:00.050 --> 04:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
person who's registered cannot be
 
04:55:03.650 --> 04:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
punished for their status is added in to
 
04:55:05.090 --> 04:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
where it already states that for testing
 
04:55:07.320 --> 04:55:12.948 align:start position:0%
where it already states that for testing
positive

04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there is any testing
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
available to tell the difference whether
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
would you call it a metabolize
 
04:55:26.570 --> 04:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
metabolite metabolites yes uh is is
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
there any testing available to to
 
04:55:33.050 --> 04:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
differentiate between that and whether I
 
04:55:34.730 --> 04:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
smoke the joint on the way to work this
 
04:55:34.740 --> 04:55:35.570 align:start position:0%
smoke the joint on the way to work this
morning

04:55:35.570 --> 04:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:55:37.730 --> 04:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:55:40.208 --> 04:55:40.218 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question
 
04:55:43.128 --> 04:55:43.138 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
I don't believe I was able to circulate
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
what I would like to have but I have a I
 
04:55:49.970 --> 04:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
have a photo of one of the prescription
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
bottles and it has all of the
 
04:55:51.958 --> 04:55:53.390 align:start position:0%
bottles and it has all of the
ingredients

04:55:53.390 --> 04:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
04:55:57.650 --> 04:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
that are on in in one of the capsules
 
04:56:01.550 --> 04:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
that they synthesize and it has all of
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
the ingredients that in it written on
 
04:56:08.208 --> 04:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
the outside of the label so you might be
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
taste taking something that's strictly a
 
04:56:14.208 --> 04:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
cannabinoid that has no THC in it which
 
04:56:15.970 --> 04:56:15.980 align:start position:0%
is the psychoactive
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
chemical that's in in the plants that
 
04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
we're using for therapeutic cannabis and
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
in all cannabis plants actually
 
04:56:26.690 --> 04:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
no you cannot do a THC level like you
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
can do a blood alcohol level or like you
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
can do you know
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
detect the trace elements of of other
 
04:56:41.270 --> 04:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
drugs that are of shorter duration
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
but the thought that what happens when
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.410 --> 04:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
cannabis is very different in in every
 
04:56:53.208 --> 04:56:53.218 align:start position:0%
person but it
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
routinely leaves breakdown products in
 
04:56:59.448 --> 04:56:59.458 align:start position:0%
the blood in the fat of your body that
 
04:57:01.250 --> 04:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
persist for a long period of time that
 
04:57:02.570 --> 04:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
really have nothing to do with
 
04:57:02.580 --> 04:57:04.010 align:start position:0%
really have nothing to do with
impairment

04:57:04.010 --> 04:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
impairment
 
04:57:04.020 --> 04:57:05.750 align:start position:0%
impairment
so

04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:07.850 --> 04:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
I remember during the hearing that it
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
came up people were asking well how
 
04:57:12.530 --> 04:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
would I know if this person was impaired
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
or not well do they smell like smoke do
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
they act impaired are their eyes glassy
 
04:57:21.050 --> 04:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
are they having trouble staying on topic
 
04:57:23.570 --> 04:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
um are they able to perform the duties
 
04:57:26.448 --> 04:57:26.458 align:start position:0%
of their job just as if someone was
 
04:57:28.910 --> 04:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
showing up impaired from alcohol or
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
cocaine or for anything there are
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
noticeable behaviors that you would want
 
04:57:33.000 --> 04:57:33.948 align:start position:0%
noticeable behaviors that you would want
to

04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
address with a person if you felt that
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
they were intoxicated on the job
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
however this bill is really not about
 
04:57:48.170 --> 04:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
that it's more about if I decide that
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take upon myself
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
that I would like to be treated in the
 
04:57:56.090 --> 04:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program for
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
whatever reasons I may have maybe I'm
 
04:58:00.110 --> 04:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
allergic to opiate medication maybe I'm
 
04:58:03.050 --> 04:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
afraid to have surgeries and things that
 
04:58:05.930 --> 04:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
are that are recommended in the
 
04:58:08.530 --> 04:58:08.540 align:start position:0%
traditional medicine world and and maybe
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
those things are really violent and
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
difficult you know cause constipation
 
04:58:16.490 --> 04:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
and illness and where you wind up taking
 
04:58:19.730 --> 04:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
like many more medications than I'm not
 
04:58:21.410 --> 04:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
questioning why you know why you're
 
04:58:23.448 --> 04:58:23.458 align:start position:0%
taking it I'm just I just want to know
 
04:58:27.550 --> 04:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
what can we differentiate between I took
 
04:58:30.530 --> 04:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
a pill or whatever last night
 
04:58:32.690 --> 04:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
okay and I smoked a joint this morning
 
04:58:34.850 --> 04:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
before I came to work and I'm all messed
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
up uh you said you know the the the uh
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
you know the job performance and I don't
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
think that'll hold up in a court of law
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know police officers are having a
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
hard time
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
arresting people for driving under the
 
04:58:49.550 --> 04:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
influence of marijuana because there's
 
04:58:50.810 --> 04:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
no test
 
04:58:53.690 --> 04:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
and um you know the the potential for
 
04:58:57.170 --> 04:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
for widespread abuse and workplace
 
04:59:02.390 --> 04:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.400 --> 04:59:04.610 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:59:04.610 --> 04:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions on um on your
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment line 13 and 14 talks about the
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
federal contract and Licensing
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
obligations so I'm going to make an
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
assumption that that would relate to the
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
dot licensing standard right so if I'm
 
04:59:23.330 --> 04:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
if I have a position available
 
04:59:25.730 --> 04:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
that require somebody to get a DOT
 
04:59:28.250 --> 04:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
license to drive a truck that they need
 
04:59:30.830 --> 04:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to pass their DOT test and if
 
04:59:30.840 --> 04:59:31.610 align:start position:0%
to be able to pass their DOT test and if
they're

04:59:31.610 --> 04:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
if they're using cannabis they cannot
 
04:59:35.270 --> 04:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
pass that test
 
04:59:37.368 --> 04:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
correct and they cannot work for you
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh in the service industry there
 
04:59:40.560 --> 04:59:41.270 align:start position:0%
okay uh in the service industry there
are

04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:59:41.280 --> 04:59:42.170 align:start position:0%
are
um

04:59:42.170 --> 04:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:46.010 --> 04:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
oftentimes if not almost all the time we
 
04:59:48.590 --> 04:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
have service vehicles that are given to
 
04:59:48.600 --> 04:59:50.448 align:start position:0%
have service vehicles that are given to
technicians

04:59:50.448 --> 04:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
technicians
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
um or whatever over the road crew there
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
is for service
 
04:59:58.250 --> 04:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
um that do not require a DOT license
 
05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
however they do require them to be
 
05:00:01.850 --> 05:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
driving a company vehicle a company
 
05:00:03.410 --> 05:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
supplied vehicle in which the company
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
would then be I'm assuming under the on
 
05:00:08.930 --> 05:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
the hook for any accidents that may
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
happen so is there a an exclusion for
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
service Industries where a company
 
05:00:17.448 --> 05:00:17.458 align:start position:0%
vehicle or any position where a company
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle is provided
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
I have one more problem not in statute
 
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
okay and then on line 15 and 16 I'm a
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
little bit confused here it says nothing
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
in this section shall be construed to
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
require an employer to allow being
 
05:00:35.810 --> 05:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
impaired by cannabis products while at
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
work why would we be requiring an
 
05:00:42.288 --> 05:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
employer to be impaired
 
05:00:43.730 --> 05:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
does that am I reading that wrong
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall be
 
05:00:48.170 --> 05:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
construed to require an employer to
 
05:00:50.330 --> 05:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
allow being impaired by cannabis
 
05:00:52.128 --> 05:00:52.138 align:start position:0%
products while at work
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
there's something missing there
 
05:00:54.958 --> 05:00:57.288 align:start position:0%
there's something missing there
please

05:00:57.288 --> 05:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:00:59.448 --> 05:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
well why would we require an employee to
 
05:01:01.730 --> 05:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
be impaired I mean
 
05:01:04.250 --> 05:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm taking this as as I do you mind
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.610 --> 05:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
I am looking at this where it says
 
05:01:12.110 --> 05:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section shall be
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
construed to require an employer to
 
05:01:18.288 --> 05:01:18.298 align:start position:0%
allow being impaired by cannabis
 
05:01:21.288 --> 05:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
employees products well excuse me
 
05:01:23.390 --> 05:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis products while at work there is
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
missing to allow employees being
 
05:01:29.150 --> 05:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
impaired I'm not even sure if that's
 
05:01:30.890 --> 05:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
grammatically correct but there is a
 
05:01:33.550 --> 05:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
word missing there I I think the
 
05:01:36.350 --> 05:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
employee is implied there
 
05:01:38.208 --> 05:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't think it's it's
 
05:01:40.010 --> 05:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
necessarily missing if someone thought
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
it would be clear with it there then I
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it would do any harm but uh
 
05:01:45.890 --> 05:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
the the word is implied
 
05:01:49.970 --> 05:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
um so when it says being impaired it
 
05:01:52.010 --> 05:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
implies that that means an employee
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:17.690 --> 05:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
rep McKenzie thank you
 
05:02:17.700 --> 05:02:19.610 align:start position:0%
rep McKenzie thank you
um

05:02:19.610 --> 05:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
so let me try to get this straight in my
 
05:02:23.810 --> 05:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
own mind and so
 
05:02:27.470 --> 05:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
what this is is a cannabis is a
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
alternative to other medication that's
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
currently out there that this is another
 
05:02:35.208 --> 05:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
offering uh
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
two people uh to try to control pain and
 
05:02:43.550 --> 05:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
other things so this is kind of am I
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
correct in saying this is a
 
05:02:48.170 --> 05:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
um part of an offering that employees
 
05:02:52.550 --> 05:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.970 --> 05:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
under state law anyone who is an adult
 
05:02:57.708 --> 05:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and children under
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances
 
05:03:00.000 --> 05:03:01.250 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances
um

05:03:01.250 --> 05:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
can apply to be certified for the
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and there
 
05:03:09.670 --> 05:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
are there's a broad spectrum of
 
05:03:12.530 --> 05:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that you could be treating
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
so if someone may be there someone could
 
05:03:17.090 --> 05:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
be treating
 
05:03:17.100 --> 05:03:18.708 align:start position:0%
be treating
um

05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
Crohn's disease for example and if you
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
know anything about Crohn's disease it's
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
a it's a like an autoimmune disease in
 
05:03:27.650 --> 05:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
some regards and it has a lot of side
 
05:03:30.050 --> 05:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
effects the treatments that control
 
05:03:32.510 --> 05:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
Crohn's disease have profound effects on
 
05:03:35.570 --> 05:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
the body we're talking about steroids
 
05:03:38.208 --> 05:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
and and all types of
 
05:03:40.788 --> 05:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
try this try that try a lot of things
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
kind of disorders that's where the
 
05:03:45.050 --> 05:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
program started we started with people
 
05:03:48.310 --> 05:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
who had cancer and people who were
 
05:03:51.288 --> 05:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
having difficulty
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
doing their jobs because of the fact
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
that they have something like Crohn's
 
05:03:57.288 --> 05:03:57.298 align:start position:0%
disease or they are coping with cancer
 
05:03:59.150 --> 05:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
and they need to just get over the
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
nausea and they want to continue working
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
so it it really has very little to do
 
05:04:07.850 --> 05:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
with the relationship that they have
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
with their employer except that
 
05:04:13.610 --> 05:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
you could get fired or you there's
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
nothing in statute that says that you
 
05:04:19.610 --> 05:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
can't be fired on the spot and I have a
 
05:04:22.128 --> 05:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
doctor who told me he said the guy I I
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
said I said to him I said what do you do
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
do you worry about people with the
 
05:04:27.770 --> 05:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
Cannabis and he said actually a person
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
lost their job and this is so for for my
 
05:04:33.530 --> 05:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
doctor to break character and talk with
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
me about that I knew it had to be really
 
05:04:35.280 --> 05:04:36.530 align:start position:0%
me about that I knew it had to be really
important

05:04:36.530 --> 05:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:04:38.570 --> 05:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
and that's also part of why this is
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
before you
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:46.970 --> 05:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:46.980 --> 05:04:48.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:04:48.490 --> 05:04:48.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:52.250 --> 05:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
so when I when I'm trying to just
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand clearly and and
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
maybe help
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
broader understanding this is
 
05:05:02.208 --> 05:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
another opportunity for people to to buy
 
05:05:07.970 --> 05:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
into something you get into something
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
that could help them
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that that other drugs may not
 
05:05:15.490 --> 05:05:15.500 align:start position:0%
may not be effective
 
05:05:19.368 --> 05:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
and what I what comes to mind for me is
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
that this is kind of it has this stigma
 
05:05:24.170 --> 05:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
associated with it so when you mention
 
05:05:26.690 --> 05:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
you know this whole list of things that
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
you can use to control pain the various
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
symptoms when you may as soon as you
 
05:05:31.970 --> 05:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
mention cannabis it seems to have a very
 
05:05:33.650 --> 05:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
05:05:35.330 --> 05:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
um you know very different
 
05:05:38.330 --> 05:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
reaction from people and yet this is a
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
treatment program that people are under
 
05:05:43.368 --> 05:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
that makes them allows them to be part
 
05:05:46.970 --> 05:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
of uh of they can work they can function
 
05:05:49.850 --> 05:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
they can be pain control can be better
 
05:05:53.208 --> 05:05:53.218 align:start position:0%
all of these kinds of things and so as I
 
05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
understand what you're advocating for is
 
05:05:57.650 --> 05:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
this and don't test me and throw me out
 
05:06:01.788 --> 05:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
because I chose I chose this uh this
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
process or this this uh treatment
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
program compared to this treatment
 
05:06:07.730 --> 05:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
program it should be there should be a
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
whole list of things that my doctor
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
would recommend or that would be
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
recommended to me am I characterizing
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
yes you are you are you this is an
 
05:06:19.610 --> 05:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity for someone to try an
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment but one of those
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
barriers would be the kind of Reefer
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
Madness mentality that stops people from
 
05:06:30.890 --> 05:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
even wanting to try the program
 
05:06:30.900 --> 05:06:31.788 align:start position:0%
even wanting to try the program
um

05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
and it you know in another committee I
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
had someone say to me that they thought
 
05:06:36.480 --> 05:06:37.430 align:start position:0%
had someone say to me that they thought
that

05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
you perhaps I'm saying that that
 
05:06:41.930 --> 05:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
cannabis is benign I'm not saying that
 
05:06:43.128 --> 05:06:43.138 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that the other
 
05:06:45.050 --> 05:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
medications that you take have profound
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
impacts on the body whereas if you go to
 
05:06:50.810 --> 05:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
an alternative treatment center and you
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to treat your Crohn's disease you
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
may find that your blood pressure is
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
coming down and you may find that your
 
05:06:59.810 --> 05:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
skin is clearing up from something that
 
05:07:01.970 --> 05:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
was really out of balance and there's a
 
05:07:03.650 --> 05:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of other things that that
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
tumble on in your General Health begins
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
to improve when you're not taking so
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
many Pharmaceuticals to deal with the
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
profound side effects that some of these
 
05:07:16.970 --> 05:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
diseases require you to endure so it's
 
05:07:19.850 --> 05:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
an opportunity and and we have case law
 
05:07:22.970 --> 05:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
behind us that says that a disabled
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
person should be allowed to continue
 
05:07:28.490 --> 05:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
their work in the program and that's
 
05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned in in the communication that I
 
05:07:32.570 --> 05:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
received I'm going to make sure that you
 
05:07:35.208 --> 05:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
all get a copy of this but the Americans
 
05:07:37.128 --> 05:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
with Disabilities Act
 
05:07:39.170 --> 05:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
um is really what we're looking at here
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
as well and we do have precedent you
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
know behind us on that because in the
 
05:07:47.330 --> 05:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
case of a pain versus right away which I
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
think I sent out to you in your email
 
05:07:53.628 --> 05:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
um that the the Supreme Court held an
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
employee's use of therapeutic cannabis
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
recommended by their physician over
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
the um the you know the point was being
 
05:08:05.330 --> 05:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
that this was his disability so that
 
05:08:08.448 --> 05:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
that prevailed and that law
 
05:08:11.090 --> 05:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
in fact I think that was an overturn
 
05:08:12.770 --> 05:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
so there was a
 
05:08:16.010 --> 05:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
it was a reversal of a decision
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
and these suggestions basically come
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
from that from just making sure that you
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about what is the
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
engagement process with a person and
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
their employer once they decide to enter
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
this program
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
so when I look at the way things are now
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
if I were employed at the hospital
 
05:08:39.650 --> 05:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
that I formally worked at it would be
 
05:08:42.650 --> 05:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
under under this bill should it become
 
05:08:45.890 --> 05:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
law I would be able to say well I am a
 
05:08:48.530 --> 05:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient does that
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
mean you won't hire me
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
um and they're going to say well it
 
05:08:54.530 --> 05:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
depends on what we would want you to do
 
05:08:57.470 --> 05:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
what kind of tasks are involved in this
 
05:09:00.050 --> 05:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
job so I you know there's there's a lot
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
of situations where I think you have to
 
05:09:04.010 --> 05:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
trust the employer or we don't want to
 
05:09:07.010 --> 05:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
tell employers what to do but we also
 
05:09:09.650 --> 05:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
don't want everybody who's tried the
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program to be fired
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
for having the card or testing positive
 
05:09:19.730 --> 05:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
for cannabis okay I don't have a problem
 
05:09:19.740 --> 05:09:21.650 align:start position:0%
for cannabis okay I don't have a problem
with

05:09:21.650 --> 05:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
having a urinalysis or
 
05:09:29.628 --> 05:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
or a serum drug screen for an employee
 
05:09:32.390 --> 05:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to be working in anything
 
05:09:34.788 --> 05:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
sensitive or or even just to focus on
 
05:09:38.330 --> 05:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
their I I think that if there's cocaine
 
05:09:40.610 --> 05:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
in there the employer should know if
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's other illegal drugs in there
 
05:09:44.270 --> 05:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
that are not prescribed for anybody
 
05:09:46.368 --> 05:09:46.378 align:start position:0%
opiates without a prescription which
 
05:09:48.708 --> 05:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
would you know you would want the
 
05:09:51.350 --> 05:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
employer would want to know that but of
 
05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
all the things that people can be taking
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
with a prescription that they're not
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
being tested for
 
05:10:01.250 --> 05:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's really it's really impactful when
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
you compare the two
 
05:10:05.330 --> 05:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm not saying no we don't want to
 
05:10:07.250 --> 05:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
test people but I'm saying if you test
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
for cannabis and you're in the program
 
05:10:12.410 --> 05:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
we should not violate your the rights
 
05:10:14.690 --> 05:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
your if you have a disability or an
 
05:10:17.930 --> 05:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
inability to do your work then you
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:28.910 --> 05:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.050 --> 05:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
I I am a supporter of the therapeutic
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis program in general
 
05:10:35.520 --> 05:10:36.350 align:start position:0%
cannabis program in general
um

05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
but I am trying to thread the needle
 
05:10:39.840 --> 05:10:40.610 align:start position:0%
but I am trying to thread the needle
here

05:10:40.610 --> 05:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
with telling businesses what to do
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
comment you just made so in my uh I'm an
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
insurance in the insurance business and
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of vehicles going up and
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
down the road and one of my clients has
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
60 some little service bands
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they're going all over the place
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
and they have a strict rule if you get
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
into a car accident
 
05:11:03.890 --> 05:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
and you will automatically have to have
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
a drug test and if you have any kind of
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
drugs in your system
 
05:11:11.208 --> 05:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
you will be terminated
 
05:11:11.218 --> 05:11:12.708 align:start position:0%
you will be terminated
so

05:11:12.708 --> 05:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:15.770 --> 05:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want to come between their rule
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
and what's good for the therapeutic uh
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know canvas program and the people
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
that need it
 
05:11:24.770 --> 05:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
and I I apologize the beginning of your
 
05:11:26.690 --> 05:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
testimony I had to leave the room
 
05:11:29.570 --> 05:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
so we all watch these shows on TV the
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the uh um Forensic Files and they can
 
05:11:33.360 --> 05:11:34.788 align:start position:0%
the uh um Forensic Files and they can
determine

05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
determine
 
05:11:37.128 --> 05:11:37.138 align:start position:0%
um what the blood alcohol content was at
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
this and the average body metabolates
 
05:11:43.490 --> 05:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
metabolizes uh so much alcohol and a
 
05:11:45.830 --> 05:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
soap period and they can figure out you
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
know how many hours has been or whatever
 
05:11:50.750 --> 05:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
are there any type of studies out there
 
05:11:52.690 --> 05:11:52.700 align:start position:0%
that can show us
 
05:11:56.510 --> 05:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
that someone that has a THC level of
 
05:11:56.520 --> 05:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
that someone that has a THC level of
whatever

05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't even know the numbers is not
 
05:12:03.288 --> 05:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
someone who is impaired
 
05:12:03.298 --> 05:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
someone who is impaired
versus

05:12:04.550 --> 05:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
versus
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
at a certain level it is because if
 
05:12:07.970 --> 05:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
someone has
 
05:12:10.010 --> 05:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis on a Sunday
 
05:12:12.288 --> 05:12:12.298 align:start position:0%
okay and they're fine and they take it
 
05:12:14.570 --> 05:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
to go to sleep Sunday night and they go
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
to the office on Monday and something
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
happens or or to go to work Monday they
 
05:12:21.288 --> 05:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
may still have it in their their
 
05:12:21.298 --> 05:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
may still have it in their their
bloodstream

05:12:23.090 --> 05:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
bloodstream
 
05:12:25.070 --> 05:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they were impaired
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
do we have any information that would
 
05:12:32.570 --> 05:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
numerical or anything to use so we don't
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
have people getting fired
 
05:12:41.090 --> 05:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
it can't just be well I'm on cannabis
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm on the Cannabis program so you can't
 
05:12:44.628 --> 05:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
fire me because I happen to have
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
something in your blood because you
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
don't know if the person wasn't paired
 
05:12:49.250 --> 05:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm trying to figure out
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
is there anything we can have
 
05:12:56.810 --> 05:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
the committee to show whether someone
 
05:12:58.490 --> 05:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
so many parts per million or what I
 
05:13:00.590 --> 05:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't even know what the the
 
05:13:05.770 --> 05:13:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:08.570 --> 05:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
there is no test that you can where you
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
move around it
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
um there is no test that I know of
 
05:13:17.570 --> 05:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's going to tell you right on the
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
spot whether or not someone is impaired
 
05:13:22.730 --> 05:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
with cannabis I think that it's just as
 
05:13:26.810 --> 05:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
any in any other situation when you are
 
05:13:28.250 --> 05:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
standing in front of somebody who's
 
05:13:31.128 --> 05:13:31.138 align:start position:0%
impaired you begin to be suspicious and
 
05:13:33.650 --> 05:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
wonder and you know it
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
um and when you're pulling somebody over
 
05:13:37.730 --> 05:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
or observing something
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
be so the same situation someone has the
 
05:13:43.550 --> 05:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
Super Bowl right starts at 6 30 at night
 
05:13:46.368 --> 05:13:46.378 align:start position:0%
drinks till it's over gets up the next
 
05:13:49.250 --> 05:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
day goes to work maybe has a point point
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
zero zero zero one left of alcohol in
 
05:13:53.448 --> 05:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
their body they go out they're in
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
trouble because they've got in a car
 
05:13:57.890 --> 05:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
accident and that tiny bit of alcohol is
 
05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
going to show up and it's not going to
 
05:14:02.208 --> 05:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
be an alcohol related accident even if
 
05:14:03.890 --> 05:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
person was exhausted and they stayed up
 
05:14:08.090 --> 05:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
all night if they don't have that 0.08
 
05:14:10.730 --> 05:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
in their blood then they're not going to
 
05:14:10.740 --> 05:14:12.170 align:start position:0%
in their blood then they're not going to
be

05:14:12.170 --> 05:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:14:15.650 --> 05:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
punished that in in regards to that with
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis no you don't get to do that but
 
05:14:21.230 --> 05:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time it's you don't well we
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
shot down this this um this
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
bank robber and
 
05:14:29.448 --> 05:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
he had cannabis in his urine or in his
 
05:14:31.610 --> 05:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
serum so I mean there's this thing
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's things that there encounters
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you have with the police there's
 
05:14:37.490 --> 05:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
encounters that you have with your
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
employer and there's encounters that you
 
05:14:42.050 --> 05:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
have with your family and and people in
 
05:14:43.490 --> 05:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
everyday life where you wonder if
 
05:14:45.170 --> 05:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
they're impaired or not and you can't
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
prove it so I think as an employer you
 
05:14:51.050 --> 05:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
have to think about
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
um how it's just a different it's a
 
05:14:56.030 --> 05:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
different way to look at it I I think
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
because you want to be people really
 
05:15:00.650 --> 05:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
want that specific information about
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis but it's just not possible
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not possible and when you
 
05:15:07.550 --> 05:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
look at
 
05:15:07.560 --> 05:15:08.208 align:start position:0%
look at
um

05:15:08.208 --> 05:15:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
my ex-husband was a programmer and he
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
used to tell me Well an inventor and a
 
05:15:14.690 --> 05:15:14.700 align:start position:0%
double e guy and everything but he used
 
05:15:16.850 --> 05:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
to tell me that he said cocaine is the
 
05:15:19.190 --> 05:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
drug that all the people I know used to
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
use and I said why is that and he said
 
05:15:23.810 --> 05:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
because you can get it as blasted as you
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
want can we can we keep this to the bill
 
05:15:27.718 --> 05:15:32.150 align:start position:0%
want can we can we keep this to the bill
certainly

05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.448 --> 05:15:35.458 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:15:39.890 --> 05:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
a couple things um one is I'm reading
 
05:15:43.490 --> 05:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
facial expressions and I see folks in
 
05:15:46.550 --> 05:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
four people behind I have no idea what
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
your expertise might be and such but it
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
might be if
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor I've been Prime
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
sponsored many bills that I didn't know
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
everything about
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and you're doing a great job but uh
 
05:16:03.770 --> 05:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm one I'm wondering who who else has
 
05:16:06.650 --> 05:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
something to to contribute and I've got
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
something more to contribute a minute
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
too so could
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with the chair could we
 
05:16:13.850 --> 05:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
find out if there's other people they're
 
05:16:20.930 --> 05:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:28.010 --> 05:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.628 --> 05:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
I had a sneaking suspicion you might
 
05:16:30.890 --> 05:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
know something
 
05:16:30.900 --> 05:16:32.390 align:start position:0%
know something
um

05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:36.250 --> 05:16:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think that that would be very helpful
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and I'd also like to make a couple
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
points I'm reading the bill and um
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
there are some things this bill says you
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
05:16:54.650 --> 05:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
um to representative uh infantein's
 
05:16:54.660 --> 05:16:55.788 align:start position:0%
um to representative uh infantein's
Point

05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
Point
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the guy with all the little um uh
 
05:17:00.850 --> 05:17:00.860 align:start position:0%
delivery Vans
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
cannot fire an employee just because
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
that employee
 
05:17:08.690 --> 05:17:08.700 align:start position:0%
tested positive for cannabis
 
05:17:10.448 --> 05:17:10.458 align:start position:0%
and has a
 
05:17:13.970 --> 05:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card if the if the
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
if those two things are true you can't
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
fire them
 
05:17:19.670 --> 05:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
um however
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
you can fire that person if that person
 
05:17:24.890 --> 05:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
showed signs of impairment
 
05:17:27.310 --> 05:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
so what you what the employee can't
 
05:17:30.288 --> 05:17:30.298 align:start position:0%
claim is it doesn't matter if I'm
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
falling down it doesn't matter if my my
 
05:17:36.170 --> 05:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
speech is slurred I've got a card
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm off scot-free so the uh the
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
employer can't fire somebody or
 
05:17:47.208 --> 05:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
discipline somebody just because
 
05:17:50.990 --> 05:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
um they tested positive and have a card
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um so um I think that that's important
 
05:17:56.090 --> 05:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:17:58.670 --> 05:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind I think the piece that
 
05:17:58.680 --> 05:17:59.690 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind I think the piece that
was

05:17:59.690 --> 05:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
very important to uh the committee
 
05:18:04.610 --> 05:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
before we got to the subcommittee level
 
05:18:08.810 --> 05:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
was lines 13 and 14. this section shall
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
not apply in cases where this limitation
 
05:18:13.010 --> 05:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the employer's obligation
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
under federal law or regulations or to
 
05:18:17.570 --> 05:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
fulfill a federal contract or licensing
 
05:18:20.690 --> 05:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
obligation we were trying to figure out
 
05:18:23.868 --> 05:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
if the exceptions
 
05:18:27.708 --> 05:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
um served our purpose sufficiently and I
 
05:18:30.890 --> 05:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
don't know where we're at on that point
 
05:18:32.690 --> 05:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
05:18:35.868 --> 05:18:35.878 align:start position:0%
that's my view of the bill I it it works
 
05:18:38.208 --> 05:18:38.218 align:start position:0%
for me certainly the what the employer
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
is prevented from doing and what the
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
employee is prevented from doing seem to
 
05:18:45.770 --> 05:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
be covered adequately and clearly as
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
long as we insert the word employee I
 
05:18:48.060 --> 05:18:49.250 align:start position:0%
long as we insert the word employee I
guess

05:18:49.250 --> 05:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
um but um but basically that that all
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
seems to work the the issue that I think
 
05:18:57.288 --> 05:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out is whether or not
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
lines 13 and 14 do everything we want
 
05:19:01.490 --> 05:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.010 --> 05:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the question I had
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
was 126 X3 has a lot of qualifying
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
um things for employment is this looking
 
05:19:19.550 --> 05:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
to overrule
 
05:19:19.560 --> 05:19:20.330 align:start position:0%
to overrule
um

05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:24.050 --> 05:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
those restrictions and requirements
 
05:19:24.060 --> 05:19:26.090 align:start position:0%
those restrictions and requirements
no

05:19:26.090 --> 05:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:19:28.070 --> 05:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up Mr chairman
 
05:19:29.930 --> 05:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:19:32.690 --> 05:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I too share the um
 
05:19:35.628 --> 05:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
question about the the amendment however
 
05:19:37.850 --> 05:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
are we now
 
05:19:41.810 --> 05:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
if the employee tests afterwards for
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis and workman's comp and and
 
05:19:47.810 --> 05:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
let's say your liability insurance tells
 
05:19:49.368 --> 05:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
you that you allow this employee this
 
05:19:51.770 --> 05:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
person to work impaired
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to cover this accident
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
or we're not going to cover the injury
 
05:19:57.288 --> 05:19:57.298 align:start position:0%
to one of your customers where does that
 
05:19:58.850 --> 05:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
where is the protection for the employer
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
the employee is not asking the employer
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:12.288 --> 05:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
if the drug test came back that they had
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis in their system and the
 
05:20:16.368 --> 05:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
workman's compensation comes back or
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
your liability insurance comes back and
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
says we're not covering you because you
 
05:20:23.690 --> 05:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:25.368 --> 05:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
where where is the protection for the
 
05:20:30.650 --> 05:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:33.650 --> 05:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
I'm having difficulty understanding how
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
to answer that question I I understand
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
what the question is but I don't have an
 
05:20:41.690 --> 05:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
that will satisfy the whole question I I
 
05:20:46.970 --> 05:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
just keep coming back to we're not
 
05:20:48.770 --> 05:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
talking about impairment here we're
 
05:20:50.810 --> 05:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
talking about you being a member of the
 
05:20:50.820 --> 05:20:51.708 align:start position:0%
talking about you being a member of the
program

05:20:51.708 --> 05:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:20:54.470 --> 05:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
and when we're talking about the
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis I want people to
 
05:20:58.850 --> 05:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
think if you have a many planner that's
 
05:21:01.970 --> 05:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
seven by four that this pill this is
 
05:21:04.368 --> 05:21:04.378 align:start position:0%
something that we would if you were
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
impaired I would hope that your employer
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
would look into everything in your
 
05:21:10.910 --> 05:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
planner and say oh my goodness he did
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
say he was sick and he fell down you
 
05:21:15.190 --> 05:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
know to see what's going on because
 
05:21:17.690 --> 05:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the person's
 
05:21:19.310 --> 05:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis but we're going to
 
05:21:21.288 --> 05:21:21.298 align:start position:0%
be going right past the people that are
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
using opiates on the job perhaps because
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
we're suspicious of certain behaviors on
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
the part of the employee
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would would do is make
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
less suspicion on everybody there's
 
05:21:39.890 --> 05:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
rules in other words when you go to you
 
05:21:43.550 --> 05:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
get employed that if you develop an
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
illness that you wanted to treat with
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis you find the
 
05:21:50.208 --> 05:21:50.218 align:start position:0%
other treatments are radical or they're
 
05:21:52.430 --> 05:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
they have consequences that you don't
 
05:21:54.288 --> 05:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
want to face some of those treatments
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
themselves are very impairing so it
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
leaves you in the same position as a mom
 
05:22:02.810 --> 05:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
does when her daughter is going out for
 
05:22:04.730 --> 05:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
a date and the kid comes to the front
 
05:22:06.770 --> 05:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
door and you're like is he okay or isn't
 
05:22:09.708 --> 05:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
he okay I can't tell well he didn't look
 
05:22:11.448 --> 05:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
like he was high he didn't look like he
 
05:22:13.850 --> 05:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
was drunk you're going to think about
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
these things but you're not going to
 
05:22:17.690 --> 05:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
know and you're not always going to know
 
05:22:20.448 --> 05:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
so where that leaves the employer with
 
05:22:23.330 --> 05:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
the insurance company is somewhere in
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
the point of what are you having this
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
person do are you having them do
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
something that causes them to have
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
obligations under the federal law it's
 
05:22:34.730 --> 05:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
not just the employer that has the
 
05:22:36.650 --> 05:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
obligations under the federal law it's
 
05:22:39.610 --> 05:22:39.620 align:start position:0%
the employee in the employees
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:46.490 --> 05:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:47.770 --> 05:22:47.780 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
one more question for for uh this
 
05:22:52.310 --> 05:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative if I may before we bring
 
05:22:54.890 --> 05:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
in the the expert please
 
05:22:54.900 --> 05:22:55.550 align:start position:0%
in the the expert please
um

05:22:55.550 --> 05:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:58.190 --> 05:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking a lot about it seems like
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of the focus in our conversation
 
05:23:03.050 --> 05:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
here has to do with employees and
 
05:23:04.610 --> 05:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
whether or not we can terminate them or
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
take disciplinary action
 
05:23:06.240 --> 05:23:07.730 align:start position:0%
take disciplinary action
however

05:23:07.730 --> 05:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:23:11.090 --> 05:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
um what we seem to be not addressing is
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
the ability or the lack thereof to deny
 
05:23:18.410 --> 05:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
employment for somebody so we all have
 
05:23:21.410 --> 05:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the in the the job world there's a
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
job description that's put together and
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the job description there are
 
05:23:26.030 --> 05:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that are needed to fulfill
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the job
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
and while the ADA compliance is that you
 
05:23:31.550 --> 05:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
have to make a reasonable accommodations
 
05:23:34.730 --> 05:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
for those who fall into the Ada there
 
05:23:36.368 --> 05:23:36.378 align:start position:0%
are still specific job description
 
05:23:38.930 --> 05:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
requirements that are met that need to
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
be met to fulfill a job whether you need
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
to be able to lift 40 pounds or 70
 
05:23:45.530 --> 05:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
pounds or sit at a desk use a keyboard
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth so if the job
 
05:23:49.200 --> 05:23:51.590 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth so if the job
description

05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
description
 
05:23:51.600 --> 05:23:52.610 align:start position:0%
description
um

05:23:52.610 --> 05:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:55.610 --> 05:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
could not be fulfilled because this
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
person is using cannabis and maybe is
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
abusing the use of the Cannabis and
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
maybe taking more than they should
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so are you saying that the employer
 
05:24:08.750 --> 05:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
should not be able to deny that person
 
05:24:08.760 --> 05:24:10.970 align:start position:0%
should not be able to deny that person
employment

05:24:10.970 --> 05:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:24:12.590 --> 05:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
um when they find out that this person
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
is not suitable for that job because of
 
05:24:19.490 --> 05:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
the cannabis use or abuse of cannabis
 
05:24:21.288 --> 05:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
in the case that you mentioned I would
 
05:24:27.288 --> 05:24:27.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:28.610 --> 05:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
I would
 
05:24:40.490 --> 05:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
prescription requirements because they
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
are using cannabis or maybe
 
05:24:48.530 --> 05:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
well maybe they don't know the excessive
 
05:24:51.050 --> 05:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
use but they could probably tell based
 
05:24:53.810 --> 05:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
off of the interview process but
 
05:24:56.570 --> 05:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
if they
 
05:24:59.090 --> 05:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
feel the use of cannabis is going to
 
05:25:01.490 --> 05:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
impair their ability to fulfill the job
 
05:25:01.500 --> 05:25:02.930 align:start position:0%
impair their ability to fulfill the job
description

05:25:02.930 --> 05:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
description
 
05:25:05.208 --> 05:25:05.218 align:start position:0%
are you saying that they should be
 
05:25:07.788 --> 05:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
required to hire them
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
no I'm not saying that
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
so then they can choose not to they can
 
05:25:15.170 --> 05:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
choose to deny employment based off of
 
05:25:15.180 --> 05:25:16.310 align:start position:0%
choose to deny employment based off of
that

05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
you when you mentioned at the beginning
 
05:25:21.170 --> 05:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
you spoke about somebody who might be
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
using a little too much cannabis and
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
could be impaired maybe they don't know
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
how much is impairment and you would not
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
hire someone who you thought that would
 
05:25:31.070 --> 05:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
be impaired
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
if you think someone's sitting before
 
05:25:34.610 --> 05:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
you you should not hire them if you
 
05:25:36.050 --> 05:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
think they're impaired during the
 
05:25:36.060 --> 05:25:37.490 align:start position:0%
think they're impaired during the
interview

05:25:37.490 --> 05:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
interview
 
05:25:38.930 --> 05:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
I think this leads it to be very
 
05:25:48.770 --> 05:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
yeah can we have the other room the
 
05:25:53.090 --> 05:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
gentleman that uh
 
05:25:54.530 --> 05:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
from Health and Human yes certainly and
 
05:25:56.030 --> 05:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
if you would like me to distribute that
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
case law I can do that as well sure
 
05:26:12.770 --> 05:26:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody for the record my
 
05:26:16.010 --> 05:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
name is Michael Holt I'm the
 
05:26:17.208 --> 05:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
administrator of the therapeutic
 
05:26:18.530 --> 05:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
cannabis program with the Department of
 
05:26:20.690 --> 05:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Division of
 
05:26:22.208 --> 05:26:22.218 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services
 
05:26:24.050 --> 05:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have a position
 
05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill but I'm happy to provide as
 
05:26:27.770 --> 05:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
much information as I can
 
05:26:29.330 --> 05:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and answer and answer questions where
 
05:26:31.788 --> 05:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
I where where I can
 
05:26:34.310 --> 05:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
um one thing I'd like to offer up is is
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
um is is uh is the is the floor so
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
current law with regard to the
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
um is is in very employer friendly
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
um there are two Provisions that you've
 
05:26:48.410 --> 05:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
05:26:50.270 --> 05:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
um in the therapeutic cannabis law which
 
05:26:50.280 --> 05:26:51.530 align:start position:0%
um in the therapeutic cannabis law which
say

05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:26:51.540 --> 05:26:52.310 align:start position:0%
say
um

05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
if you are a patient
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.200 --> 05:26:59.628 align:start position:0%
 
possess

05:26:59.628 --> 05:26:59.638 align:start position:0%
possess
 
05:27:02.810 --> 05:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
cannabis at the workplace without your
 
05:27:05.150 --> 05:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
employer's written permission
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say that as a patient you
 
05:27:12.650 --> 05:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
are not permitted to be under the
 
05:27:15.530 --> 05:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
influence of cannabis without your
 
05:27:19.970 --> 05:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
so it's it's important it's important to
 
05:27:24.650 --> 05:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
know that as the floor
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
um and so there so there's already a
 
05:27:26.340 --> 05:27:27.470 align:start position:0%
um and so there so there's already a
process

05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:27:28.730 --> 05:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
um and and there's another provision
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
that says there's nothing in the
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law which would be
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
construed to prevent you know
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
um discipline an action against that
 
05:27:41.030 --> 05:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
employee for being for consuming at the
 
05:27:43.610 --> 05:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
workplace or being under the influence
 
05:27:46.490 --> 05:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
right so there's there's many protect
 
05:27:48.890 --> 05:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
employer Protections in the therapeutic
 
05:27:50.030 --> 05:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis law
 
05:27:52.368 --> 05:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
um already so with that understanding we
 
05:27:54.288 --> 05:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
moved to this bill and and the pro the
 
05:27:56.090 --> 05:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
problem is a real problem and that is
 
05:27:58.128 --> 05:27:58.138 align:start position:0%
you know and we all and we're all we're
 
05:28:00.530 --> 05:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
all understanding it and that is
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
um your use the night before to to help
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
you sleep with your if your your
 
05:28:07.730 --> 05:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
condition is insomnia
 
05:28:09.288 --> 05:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
um in the morning you are no longer
 
05:28:11.570 --> 05:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence however if you get
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
tested you will test positive THC what
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to do I believe is to
 
05:28:20.810 --> 05:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
say that just because you are tested
 
05:28:23.810 --> 05:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
that you test positive for THC solely
 
05:28:26.208 --> 05:28:26.218 align:start position:0%
you're testing positive THC and there's
 
05:28:27.410 --> 05:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
no other
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
um uh other factor in play
 
05:28:32.990 --> 05:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be fired
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
and and so when we look at when we look
 
05:28:36.948 --> 05:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
at the bill um or the amendment line
 
05:28:36.958 --> 05:28:37.850 align:start position:0%
at the bill um or the amendment line
eight

05:28:37.850 --> 05:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the the one of the key words here is
 
05:28:41.390 --> 05:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
solely you know uh this disappointing
 
05:28:44.448 --> 05:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
action this firing this denial can't be
 
05:28:47.448 --> 05:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
solely because you have a card
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
or solely because you fail a drug test
 
05:28:54.830 --> 05:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
it really does emphasize the
 
05:28:57.730 --> 05:28:57.740 align:start position:0%
um the the impairment standard which is
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
not black and white as we know
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement has has issues
 
05:29:05.628 --> 05:29:05.638 align:start position:0%
determining uh impairment they have
 
05:29:07.970 --> 05:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
um they're asking for more funding for
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
drug recognition uh Dre drug recognition
 
05:29:14.270 --> 05:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
experts you know for to help them with
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh with with field work to identify
 
05:29:18.288 --> 05:29:18.298 align:start position:0%
someone's who's impaired where there's
 
05:29:19.850 --> 05:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
not an immediate drug test on the side
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the road so I'm not I'm not saying
 
05:29:23.930 --> 05:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
that this is an easy you know Bill to
 
05:29:23.940 --> 05:29:24.890 align:start position:0%
that this is an easy you know Bill to
fix

05:29:24.890 --> 05:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
fix
 
05:29:26.990 --> 05:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
um however you know the the pendulum
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
right now is swung fully to if you test
 
05:29:32.330 --> 05:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
positive for THC you can be fired
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of impairment
 
05:29:38.570 --> 05:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
unlike every other
 
05:29:41.390 --> 05:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
prescription medication that might be
 
05:29:42.770 --> 05:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
prescribed to you
 
05:29:44.530 --> 05:29:44.540 align:start position:0%
and this is not a prescription medicine
 
05:29:46.970 --> 05:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
doctors don't prescribe this
 
05:29:49.070 --> 05:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
um they certify a condition
 
05:29:50.750 --> 05:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's why that's why this is
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
difficult but there's but all the other
 
05:29:54.530 --> 05:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh medications that you would be
 
05:29:56.330 --> 05:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
prescribed that you would be able to be
 
05:29:59.448 --> 05:29:59.458 align:start position:0%
used to use at the workplace
 
05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to use them at the
 
05:30:03.530 --> 05:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
workplace unless you are impaired by
 
05:30:04.970 --> 05:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
that product
 
05:30:08.570 --> 05:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
and this does not change any employer's
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
impairment standard this simply says
 
05:30:13.810 --> 05:30:13.820 align:start position:0%
that just because
 
05:30:18.550 --> 05:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
you fail a THC drug test that alone
 
05:30:22.490 --> 05:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
cannot because for that firing or
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll you know
 
05:30:32.930 --> 05:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
with that I'll happily take some take
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
some more questions or try to answer
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
some of the other questions you already
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:44.690 --> 05:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
um so I think what you're telling us is
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
that if someone has a prescription for
 
05:30:47.760 --> 05:30:50.270 align:start position:0%
that if someone has a prescription for
Percocet

05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
Percocet
 
05:30:52.670 --> 05:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and that person is taking
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the medication on the schedule
 
05:30:57.770 --> 05:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
provided by The Physician
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
05:31:03.230 --> 05:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
but the night before the morning of or
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the work day as long as
 
05:31:07.368 --> 05:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
they are
 
05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
taking it as prescribed and they are not
 
05:31:12.530 --> 05:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
showing signs of impairment
 
05:31:14.750 --> 05:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're okay and the employer cannot
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
fire them is that correct that's my
 
05:31:19.550 --> 05:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
understanding with the with the
 
05:31:21.650 --> 05:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program you need your
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
employer's written permission to bring
 
05:31:25.128 --> 05:31:25.138 align:start position:0%
it on to the where to say you know I
 
05:31:28.430 --> 05:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
understand I just trying to clarify the
 
05:31:31.010 --> 05:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh the parallels between other
 
05:31:36.010 --> 05:31:36.020 align:start position:0%
medications and in this very unique
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
substance that you can't get a
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
prescription for
 
05:31:42.948 --> 05:31:42.958 align:start position:0%
and is unfortunately uh illegal
 
05:31:42.958 --> 05:31:43.930 align:start position:0%
and is unfortunately uh illegal
federally

05:31:43.930 --> 05:31:43.940 align:start position:0%
federally
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
it creates great problems
 
05:31:49.550 --> 05:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:31:49.560 --> 05:31:51.050 align:start position:0%
so thank you
um

05:31:51.050 --> 05:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:53.690 --> 05:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
the amendment is a much stronger vehicle
 
05:31:56.208 --> 05:31:56.218 align:start position:0%
for this uh for this effort
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
um it improves and clarifies the the
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill immeasurably
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
05:32:05.810 --> 05:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
I do think that
 
05:32:09.050 --> 05:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
the Crux you're exactly right as lines
 
05:32:13.010 --> 05:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
13 and 14 where we set a floor for
 
05:32:16.010 --> 05:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
um a carve out for uh for federal law on
 
05:32:17.930 --> 05:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations
 
05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
um CDL you know is the most popular one
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
if you you know you cannot get a CDL
 
05:32:24.708 --> 05:32:24.718 align:start position:0%
license you know with uh without a drug
 
05:32:24.718 --> 05:32:25.788 align:start position:0%
license you know with uh without a drug
test

05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and this this language fully supports
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know that uh that industry uh I'm
 
05:32:34.128 --> 05:32:34.138 align:start position:0%
not an expert on how far down you know
 
05:32:36.288 --> 05:32:36.298 align:start position:0%
into state law that protection that
 
05:32:39.650 --> 05:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
Federal Protection or limitation applies
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and I do think this you know uh but I
 
05:32:43.730 --> 05:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
do think it's a it's a solid floor in
 
05:32:46.010 --> 05:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
which to build this this model would be
 
05:32:46.020 --> 05:32:46.970 align:start position:0%
which to build this this model would be
easy

05:32:46.970 --> 05:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
easy
 
05:32:49.250 --> 05:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
um to add more carve outs um say if law
 
05:32:51.170 --> 05:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement wanted a carve out for state
 
05:32:52.850 --> 05:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
and local law enforcement to say that
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
this law should not apply to them you
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
know that that would be an easy ad it
 
05:33:00.170 --> 05:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
may already be covered I don't know um
 
05:33:02.208 --> 05:33:02.218 align:start position:0%
but that would be easy to add
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
um never help you know Hospital
 
05:33:06.110 --> 05:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
association association came in and ask
 
05:33:08.448 --> 05:33:08.458 align:start position:0%
for a carve out that will be fine too
 
05:33:10.430 --> 05:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
um my colleagues have reached out to to
 
05:33:12.890 --> 05:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
law enforcement on you know on this uh
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard back from them
 
05:33:17.090 --> 05:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
um on this but uh I believe that this is
 
05:33:18.770 --> 05:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
a this is a this is a floor on which we
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
can continue working throughout the
 
05:33:19.920 --> 05:33:21.050 align:start position:0%
can continue working throughout the
session

05:33:21.050 --> 05:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
um if the concept has Merit and and I
 
05:33:25.730 --> 05:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
mean I think you know the concept does
 
05:33:27.170 --> 05:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
have Merit
 
05:33:27.180 --> 05:33:28.128 align:start position:0%
have Merit
um

05:33:28.128 --> 05:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:30.170 --> 05:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh representative over here you know his
 
05:33:32.690 --> 05:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
his question of what do you do you know
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
what what do you do when you're
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
company policy says You must
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
drug test for THC when there's an
 
05:33:44.690 --> 05:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
accident and if there's a positive test
 
05:33:47.810 --> 05:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
you get fired
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
well what happens when you get fired
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.730 --> 05:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
what happens when you get fired when you
 
05:34:00.830 --> 05:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
weren't impaired that when you when when
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
your your cannabis use was you know over
 
05:34:05.690 --> 05:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
the weekend or the night before and you
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
know the accident once up with somebody
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
else's fault
 
05:34:10.490 --> 05:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
um according to that policy you're
 
05:34:13.190 --> 05:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
getting fired for choosing this
 
05:34:14.690 --> 05:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
alternative therapy
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to opioids it's it's a
 
05:34:16.798 --> 05:34:17.628 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to opioids it's it's a
hard

05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
hard
 
05:34:19.250 --> 05:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's a hard
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
not to unravel
 
05:34:23.330 --> 05:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
um again happy to answer more questions
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I would I would actually I would
 
05:34:26.330 --> 05:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
invite you know my colleagues behind me
 
05:34:28.250 --> 05:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
to come and speak as well in case I've
 
05:34:30.410 --> 05:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
missed some important points
 
05:34:32.750 --> 05:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think you are right as far as you know
 
05:34:35.090 --> 05:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
this we're in a we're in a tough spot it
 
05:34:37.128 --> 05:34:37.138 align:start position:0%
cannabis works
 
05:34:38.690 --> 05:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
for pain
 
05:34:41.330 --> 05:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you know the the testing technology
 
05:34:41.340 --> 05:34:42.650 align:start position:0%
um you know the the testing technology
stinks

05:34:42.650 --> 05:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
stinks
 
05:34:44.690 --> 05:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
let's face it it doesn't do anything for
 
05:34:47.810 --> 05:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
any for whether you're you know just on
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
on no testing does you I mean you can I
 
05:34:52.190 --> 05:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't know the numbers but you can you
 
05:34:54.890 --> 05:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
can test for uh THC metabolites in your
 
05:34:57.050 --> 05:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
system but those numbers don't mean
 
05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
anything it just means that you have it
 
05:35:01.730 --> 05:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
in your system exactly
 
05:35:03.770 --> 05:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
um you know the the cut the cave outs we
 
05:35:06.410 --> 05:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
could sit here for days uh you know uh
 
05:35:08.690 --> 05:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know in the construction industry uh
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
the the trucking the nursing the you
 
05:35:12.890 --> 05:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
know we could go on and on and on and on
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
and on uh school bus drivers uh School
 
05:35:18.170 --> 05:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
Bus monitors anybody that's going to be
 
05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
around kids uh you know we could go on
 
05:35:21.240 --> 05:35:21.948 align:start position:0%
around kids uh you know we could go on
um

05:35:21.948 --> 05:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
until technology catches up
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
um I'd have a difficult time you know
 
05:35:30.050 --> 05:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
taking all of the rights away from
 
05:35:30.060 --> 05:35:32.288 align:start position:0%
taking all of the rights away from
employers

05:35:32.288 --> 05:35:32.298 align:start position:0%
employers
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
you can take somebody in the financial
 
05:35:35.810 --> 05:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
field goes in and makes a million dollar
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
mistake you know and uh you know they
 
05:35:40.490 --> 05:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
they might have might have did their
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
their uh therapeutic cannabis at night
 
05:35:44.510 --> 05:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
and smoked a joint before they came to
 
05:35:46.550 --> 05:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
work and make a million dollar mistake
 
05:35:49.310 --> 05:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
yet the test is the same uh whether they
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
did or didn't smoke that joint
 
05:35:54.050 --> 05:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we're really in a tough spot
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
right now the pendulum is swung the
 
05:35:58.368 --> 05:35:58.378 align:start position:0%
other way where there's no accommodation
 
05:36:01.368 --> 05:36:01.378 align:start position:0%
um for responsible use of a state legal
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
product that is being used under the uh
 
05:36:05.570 --> 05:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
under the direction of a uh of a
 
05:36:08.810 --> 05:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
physician and an employer would say you
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
know they they don't want it to split to
 
05:36:12.890 --> 05:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
swing any different uh you know we you
 
05:36:14.868 --> 05:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
have the insurance things that the
 
05:36:16.788 --> 05:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
workers comp the liability insurance
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
that I mean this is a a can of worms and
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
um you know with
 
05:36:25.310 --> 05:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
can we work on it sure and and hopefully
 
05:36:27.708 --> 05:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
the um this is my opinion hopefully that
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
the um the the technology the testing
 
05:36:33.770 --> 05:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
technology will catch up and I know
 
05:36:35.930 --> 05:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
there's a law enforcement a screaming
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
for it yeah and uh I mean we shouldn't
 
05:36:40.610 --> 05:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
hold our breath for that you know I mean
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the point behind the point behind
 
05:36:45.410 --> 05:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
this bill is that you know
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
people can't people can't work
 
05:36:48.600 --> 05:36:51.050 align:start position:0%
people can't people can't work
and

05:36:51.050 --> 05:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
I'll let Lido go ahead thank you Mr
 
05:36:55.610 --> 05:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
chairman I know we're going on long
 
05:36:57.650 --> 05:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
um under 126 X3 there are several
 
05:37:00.170 --> 05:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
Provisions um in here for employment
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
um if the employer does not give his
 
05:37:06.410 --> 05:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
um written permission or permission to
 
05:37:06.420 --> 05:37:08.030 align:start position:0%
um written permission or permission to
use

05:37:08.030 --> 05:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
use
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
um cannabis product cannabis or cannabis
 
05:37:11.208 --> 05:37:11.218 align:start position:0%
products during the day even though
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
their prescription or they're prescribed
 
05:37:16.970 --> 05:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
certified is every four hours or every
 
05:37:18.530 --> 05:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
six hours to take whatever it is for
 
05:37:20.510 --> 05:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
anxiety or whatnot and the employer
 
05:37:23.448 --> 05:37:23.458 align:start position:0%
doesn't give their consent to do that is
 
05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
that denying them employee it's them
 
05:37:27.350 --> 05:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
denying them employment because they're
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
not honoring their thing or can the
 
05:37:30.590 --> 05:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
employee go to the Department Labor
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
saying they're not honoring my plan
 
05:37:35.330 --> 05:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
um they're not allowing me to ingest
 
05:37:37.550 --> 05:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
these products during work so so they're
 
05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
I would answer this way to start and
 
05:37:46.510 --> 05:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:37:49.788 --> 05:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not a prescription it's a
 
05:37:53.510 --> 05:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
schedule one federally uh uh there
 
05:37:54.890 --> 05:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't something going by that it's
 
05:37:56.448 --> 05:37:56.458 align:start position:0%
being allowed to be used right now but
 
05:37:59.810 --> 05:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
it is it is not it is not customary
 
05:37:59.820 --> 05:38:00.830 align:start position:0%
it is it is not it is not customary
um

05:38:00.830 --> 05:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:03.230 --> 05:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
doctors are not prescribing cannabis and
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things uh
 
05:38:07.550 --> 05:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
they so they that what that means is
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
that they are not saying take exactly
 
05:38:12.170 --> 05:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
this amount on this regular schedule
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's no a prescription would be you
 
05:38:16.850 --> 05:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
know the the route of administration the
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
frequency of the dose um Etc that is not
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
part of this program you know what for
 
05:38:23.330 --> 05:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
what the providers do is certify you
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
know that a patient has a condition
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
under the law that makes you eligible
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
for the program uh and then that person
 
05:38:30.770 --> 05:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
uses uh the product purchases the
 
05:38:32.930 --> 05:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
product and uses the product to relieve
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
their symptoms there is no there is no
 
05:38:37.610 --> 05:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
doctor's orders to say take this
 
05:38:40.250 --> 05:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
particular product every four hours so
 
05:38:41.810 --> 05:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
the the scenario that you're scribing
 
05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know would it it's I've never heard
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
of of that particular case
 
05:38:49.310 --> 05:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and I would be surprised
 
05:38:50.810 --> 05:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
um I would be surprised that that that
 
05:38:52.190 --> 05:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
that would
 
05:38:55.070 --> 05:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
that would ever occur
 
05:38:57.708 --> 05:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
um we allow prescribers or we allow
 
05:39:01.250 --> 05:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
doctors to engage and you know uh for uh
 
05:39:03.170 --> 05:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
make recommendations for dispensing so
 
05:39:05.930 --> 05:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
they can call up the the atcs and say I
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't want my emphysema patient being
 
05:39:10.490 --> 05:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
dispensed uh inhalable products and the
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
atcs have to uh abide by that um
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
prescriber uh uh instruction
 
05:39:17.520 --> 05:39:18.530 align:start position:0%
prescriber uh uh instruction
um

05:39:18.530 --> 05:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:20.570 --> 05:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not but that all those things go
 
05:39:22.550 --> 05:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
through us you know we I'm not aware of
 
05:39:25.128 --> 05:39:25.138 align:start position:0%
any take two pills every day every four
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
hours uh it just doesn't happen
 
05:39:29.930 --> 05:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
okay so they say Mr chairman they say
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're taking it for anxiety and they
 
05:39:33.708 --> 05:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
have a lot of anxiety at work
 
05:39:36.410 --> 05:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
by not allowing them to use that product
 
05:39:38.448 --> 05:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
according to what it is being they're
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
being treated for would the employer now
 
05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
be denying them employment because
 
05:39:44.570 --> 05:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
they're not allowing them to do that
 
05:39:46.550 --> 05:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
05:39:48.530 --> 05:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
because this this is where
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor would come in
 
05:39:51.590 --> 05:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
and say okay well you can't do that you
 
05:39:53.930 --> 05:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
have to allow them to do that but 126
 
05:39:55.430 --> 05:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
says you need the written permission and
 
05:39:57.530 --> 05:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
the employer is denying that written
 
05:39:57.540 --> 05:39:58.788 align:start position:0%
the employer is denying that written
permission

05:39:58.788 --> 05:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
permission
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
Well I this this bill is not aimed to
 
05:40:07.250 --> 05:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
replace uh the provisions in 126x
 
05:40:09.890 --> 05:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
um the the requirement in 126x that says
 
05:40:12.770 --> 05:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to use it you
 
05:40:14.448 --> 05:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
need your player's written permission
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
right this this would this would this
 
05:40:18.170 --> 05:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
would appear next to you know the the
 
05:40:20.030 --> 05:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
current loss not intended to replace it
 
05:40:22.368 --> 05:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
so if the if the employer says you're
 
05:40:24.830 --> 05:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
not allowed to have it on at that you're
 
05:40:25.970 --> 05:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
not allowed to have it in your
 
05:40:27.410 --> 05:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
possession at work
 
05:40:29.930 --> 05:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
that would that would Trump you know
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
I would not call that a denial under
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:40:37.850 --> 05:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
law under this proposal under the
 
05:40:39.410 --> 05:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
amendment under the amendment correct
 
05:40:41.690 --> 05:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
same thing with you know using it while
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
at work again the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:40:46.610 --> 05:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
law says you can't use it while working
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
in the workplace without the employer's
 
05:40:51.890 --> 05:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
written permission so that I mean
 
05:40:53.930 --> 05:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
that stands this doesn't replace that
 
05:40:57.288 --> 05:40:57.298 align:start position:0%
this says what this says is that
 
05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
if I test you in the morning and you and
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
you cut test positive for THC I can't
 
05:41:05.208 --> 05:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
fire you solely for that like this is a
 
05:41:06.590 --> 05:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
this is a person who comes to work
 
05:41:08.390 --> 05:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't bring their you know their
 
05:41:09.770 --> 05:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
cannabis product
 
05:41:12.170 --> 05:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
um doesn't use it at work
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
but is using it at night not impaired
 
05:41:16.430 --> 05:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the next day gets the drug test test
 
05:41:19.010 --> 05:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
positive and then it's fired that's what
 
05:41:22.010 --> 05:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to prevent it
 
05:41:24.530 --> 05:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact the other Provisions that
 
05:41:26.448 --> 05:41:26.458 align:start position:0%
say you need your employer's written
 
05:41:29.330 --> 05:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
permission you know to to have it at the
 
05:41:34.010 --> 05:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:34.020 --> 05:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:40.730 --> 05:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
I think there's a distinct distinction
 
05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
that was brought up here that I think
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to note is that
 
05:41:44.760 --> 05:41:45.410 align:start position:0%
it's important to note is that
um

05:41:45.410 --> 05:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:47.570 --> 05:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the workers comp
 
05:41:51.170 --> 05:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
environment you are not necessarily uh
 
05:41:53.090 --> 05:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
denied workers compensation because you
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
might have been under the influence
 
05:41:58.010 --> 05:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
um there were cases many cases frankly
 
05:41:59.510 --> 05:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether you were under the influence or
 
05:42:02.810 --> 05:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
not you were injured I.E the Box falls
 
05:42:05.090 --> 05:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
on your head comes off of a comes off of
 
05:42:08.270 --> 05:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
a a thing and drops on your head well
 
05:42:10.550 --> 05:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that if you were sober
 
05:42:12.770 --> 05:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
or you were under the influence that
 
05:42:15.050 --> 05:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
that accident uh that made any
 
05:42:16.610 --> 05:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of the accident so I
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
think there is that distinction and that
 
05:42:22.368 --> 05:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
is that is the uh work through when you
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
do workers comp appeals and that's how
 
05:42:27.050 --> 05:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
those that those are adjudicated uh and
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
we think so it's not all black and white
 
05:42:31.730 --> 05:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the issue of workers
 
05:42:34.128 --> 05:42:34.138 align:start position:0%
compensation and I think
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think what I'm gaining from
 
05:42:40.190 --> 05:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
this is that there is an opportunity to
 
05:42:42.830 --> 05:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
offer to people uh an alternative
 
05:42:44.990 --> 05:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
treatment that may be very effective
 
05:42:46.730 --> 05:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
that may put them back in a very
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
productive environment that the employer
 
05:42:51.530 --> 05:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
still has the jurisdiction over who can
 
05:42:53.930 --> 05:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
use it when they can use it that the DLT
 
05:42:56.448 --> 05:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
laws still exists you can't you can't
 
05:42:58.610 --> 05:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
deny you know you can't drive a truck if
 
05:43:00.010 --> 05:43:00.020 align:start position:0%
you're under the influence of anything
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
so to me all all of that all of that
 
05:43:04.128 --> 05:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
exists and I think what we're trying to
 
05:43:06.590 --> 05:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
carve out is that place where we bring
 
05:43:08.810 --> 05:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
it in let people who have benefited from
 
05:43:11.330 --> 05:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
this use it and I can bet dollars for
 
05:43:12.650 --> 05:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
donuts there are a whole bunch of people
 
05:43:15.170 --> 05:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
that are on opiates in workplaces they
 
05:43:17.150 --> 05:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
never get tested for them
 
05:43:18.770 --> 05:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
um that are taking them and the employee
 
05:43:21.410 --> 05:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't know one one lick about
 
05:43:25.490 --> 05:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
what's going on so I I think it's uh you
 
05:43:26.628 --> 05:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
know I'm
 
05:43:28.250 --> 05:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
you know I think we had to work on it
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
but I I you know I think I understand
 
05:43:31.490 --> 05:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to accomplish it
 
05:43:33.770 --> 05:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:36.350 --> 05:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:43:36.360 --> 05:43:37.250 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
um

05:43:37.250 --> 05:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:39.650 --> 05:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
I guess going back to representative
 
05:43:43.010 --> 05:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
avaloni's uh question about can an
 
05:43:43.020 --> 05:43:44.090 align:start position:0%
avaloni's uh question about can an
employer

05:43:44.090 --> 05:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:43:47.810 --> 05:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
um uh deny employment to somebody if
 
05:43:50.270 --> 05:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
they want to use during the day I think
 
05:43:51.770 --> 05:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
clearly that is
 
05:43:53.690 --> 05:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
um uh they
 
05:43:56.570 --> 05:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
bottom line is the employer is given
 
05:43:59.170 --> 05:43:59.180 align:start position:0%
rights under
 
05:44:03.048 --> 05:44:03.058 align:start position:0%
126x that says that they can choose not
 
05:44:05.868 --> 05:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
to allow use during the day they can
 
05:44:08.690 --> 05:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
choose not to allow cannabis on in the
 
05:44:08.700 --> 05:44:10.490 align:start position:0%
choose not to allow cannabis on in the
workplace

05:44:10.490 --> 05:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
05:44:13.490 --> 05:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so if they exercise those rights they
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
can't be held a task because of that
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's number one
 
05:44:20.090 --> 05:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
um number two on a somewhat different
 
05:44:24.410 --> 05:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
subject I'm still sort of
 
05:44:27.230 --> 05:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
struggling with lines 13 and 14. I don't
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
know if there's somebody here who
 
05:44:31.548 --> 05:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
understands those thoroughly or not I I
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe you do
 
05:44:36.288 --> 05:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
um and which is fine I don't
 
05:44:39.288 --> 05:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
um but basically I think the the
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could benefit from a full
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
list of all the employer
 
05:44:47.448 --> 05:44:47.458 align:start position:0%
the types of employment that are
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
under the language in in those lines
 
05:44:59.030 --> 05:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I thought I heard during the uh the
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing that perhaps law
 
05:45:04.670 --> 05:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement was included in that I'm not
 
05:45:06.590 --> 05:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
sure if they are or not
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
um but basically
 
05:45:08.400 --> 05:45:09.170 align:start position:0%
um but basically
um

05:45:09.170 --> 05:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:11.570 --> 05:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
I think there's uh we would benefit from
 
05:45:13.850 --> 05:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
knowing all of whom you would be
 
05:45:16.850 --> 05:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
included in in that list we know that
 
05:45:19.010 --> 05:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
truck drivers are
 
05:45:19.020 --> 05:45:19.850 align:start position:0%
truck drivers are
um

05:45:19.850 --> 05:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
who else fire police EMS hospital
 
05:45:28.190 --> 05:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
employees as you pointed out who who all
 
05:45:30.890 --> 05:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
is included in that and I think then
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
once we've seen that we as a
 
05:45:37.030 --> 05:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can discuss whether or not
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else needs to be added but right
 
05:45:42.170 --> 05:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
now there's an invisible list at least
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
invisible to us
 
05:45:46.610 --> 05:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
um that I think we need
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know is there somebody that can
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
no I I can I can reference the the
 
05:45:54.288 --> 05:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
document that was uh referred to during
 
05:45:56.390 --> 05:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing testimony was called the uh
 
05:45:57.708 --> 05:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
the federal Omnibus Transportation
 
05:46:00.650 --> 05:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
employee testing Act of 1991. we can
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
provide a copy of that that did have a
 
05:46:03.650 --> 05:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
list of
 
05:46:07.128 --> 05:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
um of of professions that were included
 
05:46:10.250 --> 05:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
and also I if memory serves it has a
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
list of
 
05:46:14.170 --> 05:46:14.180 align:start position:0%
um professions that
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
could be included
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
um but were not required under that so
 
05:46:21.230 --> 05:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
there there's a there is there is a list
 
05:46:23.330 --> 05:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
that I've seen I don't have it printed
 
05:46:24.890 --> 05:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
out that is something that I can I can
 
05:46:27.350 --> 05:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
Provo you know we can provide and there
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
may there may be some smarter people
 
05:46:31.128 --> 05:46:31.138 align:start position:0%
behind me you know that have uh poor
 
05:46:33.470 --> 05:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
information on on what that Federalist
 
05:46:33.480 --> 05:46:34.670 align:start position:0%
information on on what that Federalist
is

05:46:34.670 --> 05:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:46:36.170 --> 05:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
um the the what what I like about the
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it goes beyond that
 
05:46:39.650 --> 05:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
list and it talks about you know Federal
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
contracts so um and and federal uh
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know licensing as as well I'm still
 
05:46:49.010 --> 05:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
reading body language and I think I saw
 
05:46:51.650 --> 05:46:51.660 align:start position:0%
I had shakes on that uh on the on the
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
issue of the list okay I'm happy to I'm
 
05:46:56.690 --> 05:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
happy to defer to my colleagues if they
 
05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
have if they have something to
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
contribute Mr chairman I think would be
 
05:46:59.520 --> 05:47:00.708 align:start position:0%
contribute Mr chairman I think would be
great

05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Academy
 
05:47:04.320 --> 05:47:15.948 align:start position:0%
uh representative Academy
okay

05:47:15.948 --> 05:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:17.208 --> 05:47:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking about Federal
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
contracts you're talking about CMS
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for hospitals and whatnot
 
05:47:24.048 --> 05:47:24.058 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
05:47:26.330 --> 05:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:31.610 --> 05:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
there are other uh other experiences as
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
it relates to Federal contracts I mean I
 
05:47:35.628 --> 05:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
you know you can't get in the shipyard
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
if you're under the influence of
 
05:47:39.170 --> 05:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
anything but yeah everybody's tested
 
05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
before the ASC Port power plant uh all
 
05:47:44.090 --> 05:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
the Building Trades are tested in many
 
05:47:46.128 --> 05:47:46.138 align:start position:0%
installations around that you just can't
 
05:47:48.048 --> 05:47:48.058 align:start position:0%
get in them until you tested so I think
 
05:47:50.810 --> 05:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's what that may speak to uh and and
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
that we're reference of federal
 
05:47:52.200 --> 05:47:56.810 align:start position:0%
that we're reference of federal
contracts

05:47:56.810 --> 05:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:01.490 --> 05:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record Matt
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
Simon I work for Prime ATC
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
one of the alternative treatment centers
 
05:48:09.410 --> 05:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:48:12.830 --> 05:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert on labor law I
 
05:48:14.690 --> 05:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
probably qualify as an expert on
 
05:48:16.850 --> 05:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis policy so I can
 
05:48:18.288 --> 05:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
help with some of the questions you're
 
05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
answering and some maybe not so much
 
05:48:24.770 --> 05:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
I think I'll start with lines 13 and 14
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
even though I'm not an expert in labor
 
05:48:30.410 --> 05:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
law my sense is that all of these
 
05:48:32.510 --> 05:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
policies are in flux at the federal
 
05:48:36.048 --> 05:48:36.058 align:start position:0%
level and uh it's hard to know how they
 
05:48:38.810 --> 05:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
might change in the future so I think
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
the goal of this sentence is to make
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever Federal requirements
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
may exist we know about commercial
 
05:48:47.990 --> 05:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license that's one that's
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
certain there may be others and if they
 
05:48:54.170 --> 05:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
exist then this would broadly make it
 
05:48:57.170 --> 05:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
clear that employers are not required
 
05:49:00.170 --> 05:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
to violate Federal mandates to
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
accommodate this section so
 
05:49:06.890 --> 05:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
I wanted to comment on testing generally
 
05:49:09.110 --> 05:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
I think first I want to explain why I
 
05:49:10.910 --> 05:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
think there's a sense of urgency to pass
 
05:49:13.490 --> 05:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
this bill sooner and later sooner than
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
later so first of all you've been given
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case where a court has
 
05:49:21.708 --> 05:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
already ruled in favor of a defendant
 
05:49:25.368 --> 05:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
and found that he was entitled to not be
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
fired from his job
 
05:49:28.930 --> 05:49:28.940 align:start position:0%
based on
 
05:49:31.128 --> 05:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
you have those details I haven't read
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
them in a while so I'll leave them for
 
05:49:32.878 --> 05:49:33.650 align:start position:0%
them in a while so I'll leave them for
you

05:49:33.650 --> 05:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:49:36.470 --> 05:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
and so we've created a situation where
 
05:49:40.190 --> 05:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's existing case law and any patient
 
05:49:40.200 --> 05:49:42.650 align:start position:0%
that's existing case law and any patient
who

05:49:42.650 --> 05:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:49:45.530 --> 05:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
gets fired say would be able to go to
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
court get an attorney pay a bunch of
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
money go through a process and achieve
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
the same result that Mr Payne achieved
 
05:49:55.250 --> 05:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
that's very expensive it's not a policy
 
05:49:58.250 --> 05:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
change it's just we know that courts are
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
now viewing this and there's precedent
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the court would likely find in an
 
05:50:04.368 --> 05:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
employee's favor if they're terminated
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
solely for either of A or B having a
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
active registration with the program or
 
05:50:15.890 --> 05:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
so the other aspect of this as
 
05:50:22.490 --> 05:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie has suggested is
 
05:50:24.650 --> 05:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
we hear from patients all the time
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
who have been prescribed opioids or
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
other medications that they find
 
05:50:31.548 --> 05:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
impairing or debilitating in various
 
05:50:33.530 --> 05:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
ways and they want to qualify for
 
05:50:36.288 --> 05:50:36.298 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis but their employer
 
05:50:41.150 --> 05:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
has a policy that broadly prohibits them
 
05:50:42.910 --> 05:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
being able to work there
 
05:50:46.250 --> 05:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
on and
 
05:50:49.970 --> 05:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
or they want to get a job in a field and
 
05:50:52.390 --> 05:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
they fear drug testing and being
 
05:50:56.030 --> 05:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
disqualified solely on the basis of them
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
being a card holding patient
 
05:50:58.440 --> 05:50:59.930 align:start position:0%
being a card holding patient
so

05:50:59.930 --> 05:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
we already have the case law
 
05:51:03.590 --> 05:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
but until we have a change in the
 
05:51:05.090 --> 05:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
statute we're not going to have clear
 
05:51:07.548 --> 05:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
guidance for employers that this is in
 
05:51:09.890 --> 05:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
fact how courts are considering this
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
issue so that's why I think there's a
 
05:51:13.610 --> 05:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
sense of urgency to try to get it done
 
05:51:15.410 --> 05:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
and get it into statutes so there is
 
05:51:17.270 --> 05:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
that Clarity for both patients and
 
05:51:19.430 --> 05:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
employers that that this is how the law
 
05:51:23.628 --> 05:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
is being not only written but understood
 
05:51:26.270 --> 05:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
and not to be a deterrent to patients
 
05:51:27.650 --> 05:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
who want to participate in the
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program as an
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
alternative to opioids or other
 
05:51:31.080 --> 05:51:33.110 align:start position:0%
alternative to opioids or other
medication

05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
medication
 
05:51:34.910 --> 05:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I think the key word as Mr Holt
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
suggested is on line eight the word
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
solely and I think that's the line that
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
threads the needle so all of the
 
05:51:43.128 --> 05:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
scenarios that I've heard presented are
 
05:51:46.070 --> 05:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
what if an employee is impaired and does
 
05:51:48.170 --> 05:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
this what if an employee is in an
 
05:51:50.690 --> 05:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
accident while at work and and there's
 
05:51:53.868 --> 05:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
always some other component Beyond A and
 
05:51:53.878 --> 05:51:55.310 align:start position:0%
always some other component Beyond A and
B

05:51:55.310 --> 05:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
B
 
05:51:58.128 --> 05:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
a is just they are a qualifying patient
 
05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
and B is just they tested positive if a
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
person's driving a car a company car
 
05:52:06.170 --> 05:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
while at work and gets into an accident
 
05:52:08.448 --> 05:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
and they're thought to be impaired
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's more than a and b that's they did
 
05:52:13.430 --> 05:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
something so I think solely is the key
 
05:52:15.288 --> 05:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
word that threads the needle
 
05:52:18.110 --> 05:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
and Strikes that balance
 
05:52:20.628 --> 05:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
as Mr Holt suggested we've done some
 
05:52:22.850 --> 05:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
Outreach trying to find out what
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
categories might not fit in 13 lines 13
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
and 14 if there is a specific carve out
 
05:52:30.770 --> 05:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
needed for law enforcement if there is
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
one needed for any other sector and if
 
05:52:35.510 --> 05:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
anybody comes forward and says we need a
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific carve out for our sector I
 
05:52:39.470 --> 05:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
think the sponsor and the supporters of
 
05:52:43.490 --> 05:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
this bill or more than open to including
 
05:52:45.470 --> 05:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
those specific carve outs if they come
 
05:52:45.480 --> 05:52:46.670 align:start position:0%
those specific carve outs if they come
forward

05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:52:48.650 --> 05:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
but nearly every
 
05:52:50.448 --> 05:52:50.458 align:start position:0%
objection I've heard has been what about
 
05:52:52.850 --> 05:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
if federal law or federal contracts say
 
05:52:55.490 --> 05:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
we can't so I think lines 13 and 14
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
address all of all of that
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I was going to comment on on
 
05:53:04.970 --> 05:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
the technology that is available for
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
testing but if you have a question
 
05:53:07.970 --> 05:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative I'd be happy to pause and
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.330 --> 05:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it there's we
 
05:53:16.730 --> 05:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
keep falling back into the
 
05:53:19.868 --> 05:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
um opioids and people who are in opioids
 
05:53:22.070 --> 05:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
to me there's a clear difference there
 
05:53:26.030 --> 05:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
when I'm prescribed an opioid opioid
 
05:53:28.070 --> 05:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
it says right on my prescription do not
 
05:53:29.750 --> 05:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
operate heavy equipment do not drink
 
05:53:31.548 --> 05:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
alcohol do not do this do not do that
 
05:53:34.368 --> 05:53:34.378 align:start position:0%
right so my my prescription itself is
 
05:53:36.110 --> 05:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
giving me my limitations and it's
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
holding me responsible by way of
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
accepting that prescription and taking
 
05:53:42.288 --> 05:53:42.298 align:start position:0%
it it's holding me responsible for my
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
actions so anything that happens beyond
 
05:53:47.990 --> 05:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
that now is solely on me
 
05:53:49.788 --> 05:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
from what I'm hearing
 
05:53:52.190 --> 05:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
this is not the case with cannabis right
 
05:53:53.930 --> 05:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
is there there is not a prescription
 
05:53:56.690 --> 05:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
that says that in in if I'm wrong
 
05:53:58.850 --> 05:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
because I'm seeing a head nod behind you
 
05:54:00.830 --> 05:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
that I would love to be corrected on
 
05:54:02.390 --> 05:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
that but is there a prescription that
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
says while you are utilizing this
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
product you should be not you should not
 
05:54:07.310 --> 05:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
be operating heavy equipment you should
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
not be using alcohol you should same
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
thing is there personal responsibility
 
05:54:14.810 --> 05:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
by way of accepting that prescription
 
05:54:17.090 --> 05:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question is there
 
05:54:19.368 --> 05:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility absolutely yes
 
05:54:21.410 --> 05:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic cannabis program it's
 
05:54:24.010 --> 05:54:24.020 align:start position:0%
not a prescription because it can't be
 
05:54:26.930 --> 05:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
doctors can't prescribe a schedule on
 
05:54:28.430 --> 05:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
controlled substance so the
 
05:54:31.368 --> 05:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
certification is a parallel process that
 
05:54:33.048 --> 05:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
resembles a prescription but is
 
05:54:35.570 --> 05:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
different in some key respects so every
 
05:54:37.850 --> 05:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
product that we dispense comes with
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
warning labels every patient that we
 
05:54:42.650 --> 05:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
take into the program there's required
 
05:54:45.770 --> 05:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
intake paperwork that explains cannabis
 
05:54:47.690 --> 05:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
and some of the potential risks the
 
05:54:49.730 --> 05:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
patients have to sign that they've
 
05:54:51.470 --> 05:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
received that paperwork
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
we offer initial consultations for any
 
05:54:56.868 --> 05:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
first-time patient we encourage them to
 
05:54:58.010 --> 05:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
sit down with one of our patient
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
Educators talk through the risks and
 
05:55:02.448 --> 05:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
potential benefits talk to patients
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
about how they can get the most positive
 
05:55:06.770 --> 05:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
use out of cannabis without negative
 
05:55:08.990 --> 05:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
side effects without
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
you know most patients are not looking
 
05:55:12.708 --> 05:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
to be impaired they're not looking to be
 
05:55:14.270 --> 05:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
intoxicated they're trying to feel
 
05:55:14.280 --> 05:55:15.110 align:start position:0%
intoxicated they're trying to feel
better

05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:55:16.670 --> 05:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
and in most cases they've been
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
prescribed treatments that they
 
05:55:22.090 --> 05:55:22.100 align:start position:0%
found either didn't work or did produce
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
negative side effects and particularly
 
05:55:26.570 --> 05:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
with opioids impairment is one of those
 
05:55:28.990 --> 05:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
negative side effects so
 
05:55:31.310 --> 05:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know we have and some of those
 
05:55:33.530 --> 05:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
patients that we've helped get off
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
opioids over the years some of them work
 
05:55:37.730 --> 05:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
for us now and are opioid free and our
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
participants in the therapeutic canvas
 
05:55:39.360 --> 05:55:40.368 align:start position:0%
participants in the therapeutic canvas
program

05:55:40.368 --> 05:55:40.378 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
and they're functioning productive
 
05:55:45.288 --> 05:55:45.298 align:start position:0%
employees at our ATC
 
05:55:47.690 --> 05:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
we also serve lots of patients who were
 
05:55:49.310 --> 05:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
not able to work five or ten years ago
 
05:55:51.970 --> 05:55:51.980 align:start position:0%
but are able to work now that they've
 
05:55:54.650 --> 05:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
achieved Better Health in part through
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
05:55:58.010 --> 05:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
so we want to get rid of that deterrent
 
05:55:58.020 --> 05:55:59.390 align:start position:0%
so we want to get rid of that deterrent
that

05:55:59.390 --> 05:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:01.368 --> 05:56:01.378 align:start position:0%
it's heartbreaking to hear from patients
 
05:56:03.770 --> 05:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
who say I want to be on this program so
 
05:56:03.780 --> 05:56:04.788 align:start position:0%
who say I want to be on this program so
badly

05:56:04.788 --> 05:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
badly
 
05:56:07.128 --> 05:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
and maybe they've tried cannabis once or
 
05:56:08.868 --> 05:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
twice and found that it helped them but
 
05:56:11.090 --> 05:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
they have to factor in the sphere of
 
05:56:13.250 --> 05:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
losing their job or not getting their
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
next job if they do go on the program
 
05:56:19.490 --> 05:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
but to me this brings us back to the
 
05:56:22.430 --> 05:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
question of being able to test this and
 
05:56:25.010 --> 05:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
um to be able to test it and we keep
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
using the example of I used last night
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I come to work today that you know
 
05:56:31.730 --> 05:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not impaired but if I used five
 
05:56:33.288 --> 05:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
minutes before I walked through this
 
05:56:33.298 --> 05:56:34.190 align:start position:0%
minutes before I walked through this
door

05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
door
 
05:56:36.470 --> 05:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
nobody's able to tell me that I or be
 
05:56:39.288 --> 05:56:39.298 align:start position:0%
able to tell if I took cannabis before I
 
05:56:40.250 --> 05:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
walked through the door of the state
 
05:56:42.590 --> 05:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
house because the test is going to be
 
05:56:45.530 --> 05:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
the same and you know there are many
 
05:56:47.810 --> 05:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
people with very addictive personalities
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I've got you know one myself where
 
05:56:51.948 --> 05:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
I've got an addiction to Chocolate I
 
05:56:54.770 --> 05:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
can't give it up but um so they're
 
05:56:56.208 --> 05:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
they're just addicted they're addicted
 
05:56:57.770 --> 05:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
to that feeling I mean I've got a
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law who is in rehab so same
 
05:57:01.490 --> 05:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
thing how do you control that when
 
05:57:05.810 --> 05:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
they've got this addiction to cannabis
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
so I think that's a good invitation for
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
me to talk about the technology that is
 
05:57:12.470 --> 05:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
available with testing so there's two
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
main ways that cannabis can be tested
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
for one is a urine test and that does
 
05:57:21.948 --> 05:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
not tell you anything other than that
 
05:57:24.048 --> 05:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
there are cannabis metabolites present
 
05:57:27.410 --> 05:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
so an individual could test positive for
 
05:57:30.048 --> 05:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
you know up to a month or even more in
 
05:57:33.788 --> 05:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
some cases after most recent use
 
05:57:37.010 --> 05:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
so that isn't helpful at all but
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is how most
 
05:57:41.170 --> 05:57:41.180 align:start position:0%
pre-employment drug screening is handled
 
05:57:45.170 --> 05:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
and you know I have a friend who tested
 
05:57:48.048 --> 05:57:48.058 align:start position:0%
he quit smoking cannabis for
 
05:57:50.510 --> 05:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
I think six weeks because he wanted to
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
get this job
 
05:57:54.530 --> 05:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
and yet he still tested positive and
 
05:57:58.850 --> 05:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
didn't get the job so like it's really
 
05:57:58.860 --> 05:58:02.690 align:start position:0%
didn't get the job so like it's really
uh

05:58:02.690 --> 05:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
urine testing is not helpful in any way
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
except to find that somebody has used
 
05:58:08.750 --> 05:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis at some point in the past blood
 
05:58:10.788 --> 05:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
testing is also available and blood
 
05:58:14.208 --> 05:58:14.218 align:start position:0%
testing will tell you recent use and
 
05:58:16.250 --> 05:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
we'll tell you because it'll you know
 
05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis will clear from your your
 
05:58:18.000 --> 05:58:19.970 align:start position:0%
cannabis will clear from your your
bloodstream

05:58:19.970 --> 05:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
bloodstream
 
05:58:22.010 --> 05:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
within a couple of days there will still
 
05:58:25.670 --> 05:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
be traces and metabolites but actual THC
 
05:58:25.680 --> 05:58:29.030 align:start position:0%
be traces and metabolites but actual THC
so

05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:31.128 --> 05:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
blood testing will tell you that
 
05:58:32.690 --> 05:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
somebody's used cannabis somewhat
 
05:58:34.490 --> 05:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
recently the problems now with the
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
technology the problem is that cannabis
 
05:58:40.010 --> 05:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
isn't like alcohol and our bodies don't
 
05:58:43.610 --> 05:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
metabolize it in a predictable way so
 
05:58:47.690 --> 05:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
with alcohol we have a 0.08 standard
 
05:58:50.208 --> 05:58:50.218 align:start position:0%
that's fairly well accepted and we know
 
05:58:52.970 --> 05:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
that individuals no matter how much they
 
05:58:55.070 --> 05:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
drink no matter how long they've been
 
05:58:55.080 --> 05:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
drink no matter how long they've been
drinking

05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
05:58:57.708 --> 05:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
you know some
 
05:59:00.230 --> 05:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
tolerance might explain some people
 
05:59:01.970 --> 05:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
being able to handle alcohol somewhat
 
05:59:03.470 --> 05:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
better than others but we know that
 
05:59:07.128 --> 05:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
anybody is impaired at 0.08 or above
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
with cannabis
 
05:59:11.628 --> 05:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
and with cocaine and with opioids and
 
05:59:13.610 --> 05:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
with just about any other substance you
 
05:59:16.010 --> 05:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
could become impaired on there's no
 
05:59:19.850 --> 05:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
bright line where Above This
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to be impaired and below
 
05:59:24.110 --> 05:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
it nobody's going to be impaired we just
 
05:59:26.090 --> 05:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
don't have that so a patient who's
 
05:59:28.070 --> 05:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking a high dose edible every night
 
05:59:30.288 --> 05:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
for pain and insomnia
 
05:59:33.048 --> 05:59:33.058 align:start position:0%
is never going to be impaired during the
 
05:59:35.750 --> 05:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
day you could apply a field sobriety
 
05:59:38.030 --> 05:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
test you could apply an advanced Drug
 
05:59:40.970 --> 05:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
recognition expert test it's a 12 point
 
05:59:40.980 --> 05:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
recognition expert test it's a 12 point
test

05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
test
 
05:59:44.868 --> 05:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
designed to look for drug impairment
 
05:59:47.448 --> 05:59:47.458 align:start position:0%
patient may test higher than 0.5
 
05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
nanograms per liter which is a standard
 
05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
in some states it's not based on
 
05:59:51.360 --> 05:59:52.788 align:start position:0%
in some states it's not based on
anything

05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
but there's no evidence that they're
 
05:59:58.610 --> 05:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
actually impaired so again if there's a
 
06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
credible allegation that an employee is
 
06:00:03.708 --> 06:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
impaired while at work
 
06:00:06.470 --> 06:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's not covered by this bill there's
 
06:00:08.930 --> 06:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
no protection by this bill
 
06:00:12.470 --> 06:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
all this bill says is that these actions
 
06:00:15.048 --> 06:00:15.058 align:start position:0%
can't be based solely
 
06:00:18.410 --> 06:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
on status as a card holding patient or
 
06:00:21.770 --> 06:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
solely on a positive drug test if you
 
06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
cause an accident at work and and you
 
06:00:25.610 --> 06:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
know somebody gets hurt or something
 
06:00:26.690 --> 06:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:00:27.890 --> 06:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
and there's evidence that you're
 
06:00:27.900 --> 06:00:29.208 align:start position:0%
and there's evidence that you're
impaired

06:00:29.208 --> 06:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
you don't need
 
06:00:33.288 --> 06:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
a bulletproof test to prove impairment
 
06:00:46.010 --> 06:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:47.868 --> 06:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
an interview process is enough to be
 
06:00:50.150 --> 06:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
able to determine that so I just don't
 
06:00:50.160 --> 06:00:51.048 align:start position:0%
able to determine that so I just don't
think

06:00:51.048 --> 06:00:51.058 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:00:52.910 --> 06:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
I don't like the part about denying
 
06:00:54.470 --> 06:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
employment I think an employer should be
 
06:00:56.708 --> 06:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
able to decide that but
 
06:01:01.128 --> 06:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
I I get the part about employment you
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a you can see a pattern of a person
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
you can you can you know a person you
 
06:01:07.010 --> 06:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
when they're employed you can you can
 
06:01:08.510 --> 06:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
learn their patterns you can see their
 
06:01:16.490 --> 06:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:19.850 --> 06:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
if I may volunteer one more clarifying
 
06:01:21.770 --> 06:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
piece of information for your
 
06:01:24.890 --> 06:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative the um it under the theme
 
06:01:26.448 --> 06:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
under the category of setting the floor
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program
 
06:01:31.368 --> 06:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
um law 126x
 
06:01:34.250 --> 06:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
um uh colon 3 it
 
06:01:36.410 --> 06:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
you are not allowed to be under the
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
influence of cannabis while
 
06:01:41.208 --> 06:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
operating a motor operating a motor
 
06:01:44.208 --> 06:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
vehicle commercial vehicle boat vessel
 
06:01:46.070 --> 06:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
or any other vehicle propelled or drawn
 
06:01:48.350 --> 06:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
by power other than muscular power in
 
06:01:48.360 --> 06:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
by power other than muscular power in
addition

06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
addition
 
06:01:51.470 --> 06:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to operate heavy
 
06:01:54.190 --> 06:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
machinery or handle a dangerous
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
instrumentality so again these are other
 
06:01:58.970 --> 06:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
areas where the you know just because
 
06:02:01.010 --> 06:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
you're a patient using it you know you
 
06:02:03.470 --> 06:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
are not permitted under current state
 
06:02:07.548 --> 06:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
law from being under the influence of
 
06:02:10.190 --> 06:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
the product
 
06:02:11.690 --> 06:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
um and so there's there's already these
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
Protections in here so when we want to
 
06:02:15.288 --> 06:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
answer your question about you know your
 
06:02:16.970 --> 06:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
opioid prescription says don't operate
 
06:02:19.548 --> 06:02:19.558 align:start position:0%
heavy machinery yeah the therapeutic
 
06:02:22.190 --> 06:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis law already prevents you
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
um and and in in more than it more than
 
06:02:25.970 --> 06:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
prevents you
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
you are subject to arrest even if you
 
06:02:29.690 --> 06:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
have a card
 
06:02:32.090 --> 06:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
and you're using it you're subject to
 
06:02:32.100 --> 06:02:33.110 align:start position:0%
and you're using it you're subject to
arrest

06:02:33.110 --> 06:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
arrest
 
06:02:34.730 --> 06:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
um if you're not compliant with those uh
 
06:02:36.470 --> 06:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
those laws so I just wanted to offer
 
06:02:39.590 --> 06:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
that as well as part of the floor I I
 
06:02:43.010 --> 06:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
understand that it just from a
 
06:02:44.930 --> 06:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
probably more committed conversation in
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
you as well but
 
06:02:49.190 --> 06:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
from a hiring practice
 
06:02:52.368 --> 06:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
if I am hiring somebody to come in and
 
06:02:54.948 --> 06:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
operate a forklift in a shop and have to
 
06:02:56.570 --> 06:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
be you know be able to operate this work
 
06:02:58.670 --> 06:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
with I'm not going to be able to know
 
06:03:00.650 --> 06:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
he's going to come in clean for his
 
06:03:03.650 --> 06:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
interview this person he she whichever
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
um you know they're not gonna I'm
 
06:03:06.890 --> 06:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
assuming they're not going to come into
 
06:03:09.110 --> 06:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
the interview process impaired and
 
06:03:10.310 --> 06:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell me all of the
 
06:03:12.470 --> 06:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
right things no I don't do this no I
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't do that no I don't do this so now
 
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
I send them off to a drug screening and
 
06:03:19.610 --> 06:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
find out that you know they're on they
 
06:03:21.110 --> 06:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
have cannabis in their system and I have
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make a decision when I have a couple
 
06:03:25.610 --> 06:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
of people here to choose from I'm not
 
06:03:27.410 --> 06:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
hiring this guy he might be a little bit
 
06:03:29.868 --> 06:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
more qualified but he's taking cannabis
 
06:03:33.048 --> 06:03:33.058 align:start position:0%
and this guy he's also qualified but
 
06:03:34.490 --> 06:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
he's not
 
06:03:36.650 --> 06:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
so am I going to be able to make that
 
06:03:38.448 --> 06:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
decision to say I'm not hiring this guy
 
06:03:39.770 --> 06:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
of course I'm not going to tell him I'm
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
not hiring him because of the Cannabis
 
06:03:43.010 --> 06:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
right so now he's got to prove that I
 
06:03:44.570 --> 06:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
denied him employment because he's on
 
06:03:46.850 --> 06:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
cannabis and the other guy's not so how
 
06:03:49.128 --> 06:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
does that work I think employers deal
 
06:03:52.070 --> 06:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
with those kinds of questions uh every
 
06:03:55.610 --> 06:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
day outside of this realm of cannabis of
 
06:03:57.650 --> 06:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
determining you know everything else
 
06:03:58.850 --> 06:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
being equal
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to choose this person based on
 
06:04:04.190 --> 06:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
subjective uh criteria and I don't think
 
06:04:05.930 --> 06:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
I don't think this I don't know this is
 
06:04:07.730 --> 06:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
any different I would suggest that any
 
06:04:10.670 --> 06:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
hiring process is a crap shoot
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
which makes this
 
06:04:16.070 --> 06:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
this here says no employment shall deny
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.128 --> 06:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
you can deny based on any other reason
 
06:04:24.530 --> 06:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
Allowed by law now they're facing a
 
06:04:26.448 --> 06:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that I you know wasn't hired
 
06:04:30.830 --> 06:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:32.810 --> 06:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
I would offer that there's 14 000
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
patients in the therapeutic cannabis
 
06:04:36.110 --> 06:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
program just to
 
06:04:40.128 --> 06:04:40.138 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of of the scope and the
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of them are outside of
 
06:04:45.048 --> 06:04:45.058 align:start position:0%
working age
 
06:04:47.570 --> 06:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and and and don't work
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
um many of them are working because they
 
06:04:51.890 --> 06:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
now can
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
yeah just it's a relatively small
 
06:04:55.548 --> 06:04:55.558 align:start position:0%
program this is a small population we're
 
06:04:57.310 --> 06:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative evelini thank you Mr
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman this has been my last question
 
06:05:04.610 --> 06:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
um uh so a an employee long-term
 
06:05:06.288 --> 06:05:06.298 align:start position:0%
employee gets into a car accident on
 
06:05:07.730 --> 06:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
their own time
 
06:05:09.590 --> 06:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
gets into this program
 
06:05:13.490 --> 06:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
the employer has a no tolerance policy
 
06:05:17.330 --> 06:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh basically you're solely becomes now
 
06:05:20.208 --> 06:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
they now they're a Cod carrying member
 
06:05:22.250 --> 06:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
06:05:25.610 --> 06:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
is that superseding employer policy the
 
06:05:27.170 --> 06:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
employer now cannot terminate that
 
06:05:28.310 --> 06:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
employee because they have a zero
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
tolerance policy
 
06:05:32.690 --> 06:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't follow the I didn't
 
06:05:35.570 --> 06:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
follow the the example or the anecdote
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
so if the employer has a zero tolerance
 
06:05:39.048 --> 06:05:39.058 align:start position:0%
policy for drugs
 
06:05:41.448 --> 06:05:41.458 align:start position:0%
the employee through no fault of the
 
06:05:42.890 --> 06:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
employer goes out and gets into a car
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
accident on a Saturday night taking
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
their family out to dinner
 
06:05:48.048 --> 06:05:48.058 align:start position:0%
they get into this program down the road
 
06:05:49.750 --> 06:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
because they were given prescribed
 
06:05:52.368 --> 06:05:52.378 align:start position:0%
opioids or whatever
 
06:05:54.708 --> 06:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
now comes back to the
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
employer and says I'm now part of this
 
06:05:59.330 --> 06:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
program you can't fire me
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
and they they got the card after the
 
06:06:03.770 --> 06:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
accident after the accident still
 
06:06:06.170 --> 06:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
employed by the employer
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
I I'm not I you know I'm not an employer
 
06:06:11.390 --> 06:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't I'm not an attorney who
 
06:06:13.610 --> 06:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
deals with labor law so you know I'm
 
06:06:15.470 --> 06:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
unprepared to answer these these
 
06:06:17.690 --> 06:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
questions as an employer that's the
 
06:06:20.030 --> 06:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
question I would have
 
06:06:21.470 --> 06:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
how would your attorneys answer that
 
06:06:21.480 --> 06:06:22.490 align:start position:0%
how would your attorneys answer that
question

06:06:22.490 --> 06:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:06:22.500 --> 06:06:23.330 align:start position:0%
question
no

06:06:23.330 --> 06:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:06:24.890 --> 06:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if there was something you
 
06:06:27.048 --> 06:06:27.058 align:start position:0%
guys knew that we didn't on that topic
 
06:06:29.570 --> 06:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
what happens during mid-employment if
 
06:06:31.868 --> 06:06:31.878 align:start position:0%
this if their situation changes from a
 
06:06:34.490 --> 06:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
non-cannabis using person to a cannabis
 
06:06:35.750 --> 06:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
using person
 
06:06:38.270 --> 06:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
under this program and the employer has
 
06:06:40.010 --> 06:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
a Serial I don't know I mean we we deal
 
06:06:43.190 --> 06:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
with patients who are in mid
 
06:06:46.190 --> 06:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
um you know are in the midst of a uh
 
06:06:48.530 --> 06:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
we we have patients who get cards after
 
06:06:51.410 --> 06:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
they get arrested for possession when
 
06:06:53.570 --> 06:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
they don't have a card and so part of
 
06:06:55.670 --> 06:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
their plea deals become
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
um if you go get a if you can get if you
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
get your doctor to sign off and you get
 
06:07:01.368 --> 06:07:01.378 align:start position:0%
a therapeutic cannabis card you know we
 
06:07:03.288 --> 06:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
will you know we'll drop the charges or
 
06:07:04.850 --> 06:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
you know it's the basis of a plea deal
 
06:07:06.890 --> 06:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
or whatnot so that's the only experience
 
06:07:09.548 --> 06:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
that I have in terms of a mid-process
 
06:07:12.948 --> 06:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
process uh you know for uh getting a
 
06:07:15.410 --> 06:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
card in the middle of an incident that
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
is under question but employment I don't
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:25.310 --> 06:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative infantine thank you I
 
06:07:27.650 --> 06:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
just I I think I follow the pattern here
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make sure I
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
understand it because um here a lot of
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
your testimonies have been very helpful
 
06:07:34.250 --> 06:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
so you have approximately 14 000 people
 
06:07:36.410 --> 06:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic cannabis program can
 
06:07:38.090 --> 06:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
you give me a ballpark about how many
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
are working maybe a thousand you said it
 
06:07:42.410 --> 06:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
was a small amount
 
06:07:43.970 --> 06:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't have that I don't have
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
that data I'm just saying that there's
 
06:07:47.628 --> 06:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
many many you know 70 and 80 year olds
 
06:07:51.470 --> 06:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
on the program uh as well okay so the
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
the log so I can read it that you're out
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that you were reciting about the as
 
06:07:58.970 --> 06:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
you call it the ground floor
 
06:08:04.610 --> 06:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
what is the RSA RSA 126 Dash X
 
06:08:06.590 --> 06:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay so it's just including here this x
 
06:08:10.250 --> 06:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
colon three okay okay as the prohibition
 
06:08:12.650 --> 06:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:08:14.330 --> 06:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't want to sneeze here I just
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
went touching my nose um my an employer
 
06:08:21.830 --> 06:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
has to
 
06:08:21.840 --> 06:08:24.170 align:start position:0%
has to
agree

06:08:24.170 --> 06:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
agree
 
06:08:26.810 --> 06:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
as you said before they have to agree in
 
06:08:28.730 --> 06:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
writing to this
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct if someone is going to be in
 
06:08:32.570 --> 06:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
their employee
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
that is a terrible cannabis user
 
06:08:39.230 --> 06:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
written permission to possess at work
 
06:08:42.948 --> 06:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
okay written permission to be under the
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying to understand
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
because I've never had this happen an
 
06:08:52.490 --> 06:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
employer I'm trying to understand follow
 
06:08:55.730 --> 06:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
the bouncing ball to start so if someone
 
06:08:57.770 --> 06:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
it comes in as a brand new employee and
 
06:08:58.850 --> 06:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
wants to start and wants to be
 
06:09:02.150 --> 06:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
interviewed so they're interviewed
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
and they inform their employer that
 
06:09:07.368 --> 06:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
they're on therapeutic cannabis and they
 
06:09:09.230 --> 06:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
inform them of the law that you know if
 
06:09:11.270 --> 06:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
you get hired I have to have you
 
06:09:14.570 --> 06:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
in writing agree that I can possess and
 
06:09:16.788 --> 06:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
then be under the influence is that the
 
06:09:18.948 --> 06:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
word I want to use the right word here
 
06:09:21.948 --> 06:09:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh not influence but it
 
06:09:23.810 --> 06:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
it's not a con it's not a condition of
 
06:09:25.670 --> 06:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
employment it is a condition of those
 
06:09:28.010 --> 06:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
two uh those two behaviors the behavior
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
is uh being in possession at work or
 
06:09:32.330 --> 06:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
being under the influence at work if
 
06:09:33.590 --> 06:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to do one of those things
 
06:09:35.090 --> 06:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
you need your employer's written
 
06:09:36.470 --> 06:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
permission you don't need your
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
employer's written permission to be on
 
06:09:40.910 --> 06:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
the program and be under the influence
 
06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
and use this product at home right you
 
06:09:45.770 --> 06:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
need the the permission to bring it into
 
06:09:48.288 --> 06:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
work and to use it at work so I show up
 
06:09:52.070 --> 06:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
I am on utilizing therapeutic cannabis I
 
06:09:53.448 --> 06:09:53.458 align:start position:0%
show up for an interview
 
06:09:55.730 --> 06:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
I go to the interview or he's going fine
 
06:09:58.368 --> 06:09:58.378 align:start position:0%
it's an accounting procedure I pass all
 
06:10:01.730 --> 06:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
the the criteria or whatever I inform my
 
06:10:03.708 --> 06:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
this prospective employer
 
06:10:05.868 --> 06:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm on the therapeutic cannabis and
 
06:10:08.270 --> 06:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
I explained to them what the rules are
 
06:10:10.128 --> 06:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
going to be what the current rules are
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
in 126x
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
and they say oh
 
06:10:15.718 --> 06:10:16.970 align:start position:0%
and they say oh
well

06:10:16.970 --> 06:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:10:18.770 --> 06:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want to hire you that
 
06:10:20.750 --> 06:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's what you want to make against the
 
06:10:20.760 --> 06:10:21.410 align:start position:0%
that's what you want to make against the
law

06:10:21.410 --> 06:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:10:24.288 --> 06:10:24.298 align:start position:0%
number one correct it says right here
 
06:10:27.410 --> 06:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
you want to make yes Simply Having a
 
06:10:30.650 --> 06:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
card right and
 
06:10:32.570 --> 06:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
and having hair and disclosing that
 
06:10:35.208 --> 06:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
information is not a fireable or
 
06:10:38.510 --> 06:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
non-hirable offense yes okay
 
06:10:40.670 --> 06:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and you want the same thing if
 
06:10:43.430 --> 06:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
someone cannot be terminated or any
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
disciplinary work action held
 
06:10:49.670 --> 06:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
um who possesses uh these things but it
 
06:10:51.048 --> 06:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
says it says
 
06:10:54.770 --> 06:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:57.170 --> 06:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
current event okay but the the thing
 
06:10:59.448 --> 06:10:59.458 align:start position:0%
comes down to I think is everyone
 
06:10:59.458 --> 06:11:03.110 align:start position:0%
comes down to I think is everyone
um

06:11:03.110 --> 06:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:04.788 --> 06:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
it comes down to B I think that's where
 
06:11:07.368 --> 06:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
everyone's having the problem
 
06:11:09.170 --> 06:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
individual has a positive drug test
 
06:11:11.090 --> 06:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
indicating cannabis code does anyone
 
06:11:17.090 --> 06:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:18.288 --> 06:11:18.298 align:start position:0%
I do
 
06:11:20.750 --> 06:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay is that the termination part or the
 
06:11:23.390 --> 06:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
the they can't deny employees as we've
 
06:11:25.010 --> 06:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
been talking about the permission slip
 
06:11:28.368 --> 06:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
uh what happens if the employer says no
 
06:11:30.288 --> 06:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to give that to you I
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
can't use you now he's in violation of
 
06:11:34.730 --> 06:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
this okay that continues on though
 
06:11:38.208 --> 06:11:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:41.448 --> 06:11:41.458 align:start position:0%
um that is it also in 126 something or
 
06:11:43.250 --> 06:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
whatever about they cannot use heavy
 
06:11:45.048 --> 06:11:45.058 align:start position:0%
machinery cannot use a motorized vehicle
 
06:11:47.270 --> 06:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever is that also in 126 further
 
06:11:50.330 --> 06:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
down the yes same section okay
 
06:11:52.250 --> 06:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
you guys have to read the whole law
 
06:11:54.170 --> 06:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
just that one section well I mean the
 
06:11:56.090 --> 06:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
whole 126 or whatever to understand it
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
colon 3 is it sets these these
 
06:12:01.208 --> 06:12:01.218 align:start position:0%
requirements okay and from because
 
06:12:04.368 --> 06:12:04.378 align:start position:0%
we're thinking globally and I get it
 
06:12:07.310 --> 06:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I shame on me I mean I haven't read
 
06:12:09.530 --> 06:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
all of 126.
 
06:12:12.288 --> 06:12:12.298 align:start position:0%
to see what
 
06:12:14.810 --> 06:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
well he he rattled off quite a few but I
 
06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
can think of dozens more and uh if I
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
went home and thought about it real hard
 
06:12:21.288 --> 06:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
I could probably think a 30 or 40 more
 
06:12:23.628 --> 06:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
um job titles and uh you know things
 
06:12:27.590 --> 06:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:12:29.868 --> 06:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
um the like I said this is a can of
 
06:12:30.948 --> 06:12:30.958 align:start position:0%
worms whether it's you know you're
 
06:12:33.230 --> 06:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the insurance end of it uh he
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know it's it's
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking to see somebody gets by it
 
06:12:37.310 --> 06:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
well it'd be heartbreaking for somebody
 
06:12:38.628 --> 06:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
to lose their business because an
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company wouldn't wouldn't uh
 
06:12:43.490 --> 06:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover an accident and he ends
 
06:12:45.048 --> 06:12:45.058 align:start position:0%
up losing his house and all the rest I
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
mean you know we could heartbreaking
 
06:12:48.948 --> 06:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
things all over the place here and uh
 
06:12:50.810 --> 06:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know nobody wants to look at the
 
06:12:53.330 --> 06:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
employers the employer and what he has
 
06:12:57.230 --> 06:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:59.570 --> 06:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Susie
 
06:13:01.548 --> 06:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at it from a different
 
06:13:02.878 --> 06:13:04.368 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at it from a different
perspective

06:13:04.368 --> 06:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
06:13:04.378 --> 06:13:05.750 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

06:13:05.750 --> 06:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:07.368 --> 06:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
I agree with a lot of stuff that's being
 
06:13:10.730 --> 06:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
said here however I also just want to
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
make a statement that
 
06:13:14.990 --> 06:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that
 
06:13:17.448 --> 06:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
everybody that's on the Cannabis or the
 
06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
is stoned every day they go to work
 
06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
I think these people
 
06:13:25.080 --> 06:13:26.448 align:start position:0%
I think these people
will

06:13:26.448 --> 06:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
use cannabis at night I know several
 
06:13:31.788 --> 06:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
people that use cannabis at night
 
06:13:35.208 --> 06:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
and it's to relieve pain again
 
06:13:37.730 --> 06:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
because you have it in your system does
 
06:13:39.948 --> 06:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
not mean you're impaired so I think we
 
06:13:41.208 --> 06:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
need to get away from the whole thing
 
06:13:43.250 --> 06:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
that just because people are using
 
06:13:45.770 --> 06:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
therapy therapeutic cannabis is that
 
06:13:49.070 --> 06:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
they're in um
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
they're high every day because that's
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
not the case I think a lot of these
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
people are using it again for sleeping
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
purposes for pain purposes rather than
 
06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to opioids
 
06:14:02.150 --> 06:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
um so I think we just need to remember
 
06:14:03.410 --> 06:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
that I think that's important to
 
06:14:05.090 --> 06:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
remember that a lot of these people
 
06:14:07.788 --> 06:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
aren't going to work hi
 
06:14:09.590 --> 06:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
um and it may be in their system but
 
06:14:12.048 --> 06:14:12.058 align:start position:0%
again if I take a five milligram gummy
 
06:14:15.288 --> 06:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
at night at 10 o'clock when I go to bed
 
06:14:17.570 --> 06:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's no different than me drinking four
 
06:14:20.270 --> 06:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
ounces of alcohol in a truly when I wake
 
06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
up in the next the next morning I'm not
 
06:14:22.200 --> 06:14:23.330 align:start position:0%
up in the next the next morning I'm not
intoxicated

06:14:23.330 --> 06:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
intoxicated
 
06:14:26.208 --> 06:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not under the influence so I
 
06:14:27.410 --> 06:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
think we just need to remember that I
 
06:14:29.090 --> 06:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
think you know we're running around in
 
06:14:30.948 --> 06:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
circles here and it is it's it's a big
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is an important bill
 
06:14:35.868 --> 06:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
um but I just think we need to look at
 
06:14:39.410 --> 06:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
it from all perspectives thank you
 
06:14:41.208 --> 06:14:41.218 align:start position:0%
and to add to that there's no there's no
 
06:14:43.788 --> 06:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
way of telling who isn't either you know
 
06:14:45.890 --> 06:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
um you know I won't I don't know if it's
 
06:14:48.770 --> 06:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
50 50 40 60 what
 
06:14:51.230 --> 06:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
who knows but you're not going to tell
 
06:14:52.670 --> 06:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
me that there aren't people abusing it
 
06:14:52.680 --> 06:14:54.590 align:start position:0%
me that there aren't people abusing it
too

06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:14:57.770 --> 06:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
representative infantine thank you um if
 
06:14:59.690 --> 06:14:59.700 align:start position:0%
I might I'm not asking you gentleman to
 
06:15:01.970 --> 06:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
leave or anything um Jody you had told
 
06:15:01.980 --> 06:15:02.750 align:start position:0%

uh I apologize I had to leave the room
 
06:15:06.650 --> 06:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
for a phone call is there an amendment
 
06:15:06.660 --> 06:15:09.110 align:start position:0%
for a phone call is there an amendment
coming

06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%

06:15:09.120 --> 06:15:11.930 align:start position:0%
coming
okay

06:15:11.930 --> 06:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:16.250 --> 06:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:18.048 --> 06:15:18.058 align:start position:0%
I thought there was an amendment that
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
was going to come
 
06:15:22.610 --> 06:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
that was yeah from the police that was
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
going is that part of this Federal
 
06:15:34.128 --> 06:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:34.138 --> 06:15:49.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:15:49.390 --> 06:15:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:51.830 --> 06:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is where I'm getting at we
 
06:15:54.170 --> 06:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
have a a bill that a perennial bill here
 
06:15:56.930 --> 06:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
about uh credit checks for employment
 
06:15:59.930 --> 06:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
okay and every once in a while it comes
 
06:16:01.730 --> 06:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
through and we end up saying well it
 
06:16:05.448 --> 06:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
can't be for the new it has to exclude
 
06:16:07.070 --> 06:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know certain things the nuclear
 
06:16:09.410 --> 06:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
power plant workers at Seabrook it has
 
06:16:10.850 --> 06:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
to include anyone that is involved with
 
06:16:14.208 --> 06:16:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:14.218 --> 06:16:16.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:16:16.128 --> 06:16:16.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:19.010 --> 06:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
foreign is there going to be a problem
 
06:16:21.530 --> 06:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
if if we end up having four or five
 
06:16:23.868 --> 06:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
organizations that say we don't want to
 
06:16:25.850 --> 06:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
be included in this the police Chiefs
 
06:16:27.170 --> 06:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
Association doesn't want to involve this
 
06:16:28.730 --> 06:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
nuclear regulatory people I guess maybe
 
06:16:30.770 --> 06:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
that is covered under this federal law
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
number two
 
06:16:36.048 --> 06:16:36.058 align:start position:0%
um but you know what happens if uh
 
06:16:36.058 --> 06:16:37.490 align:start position:0%
um but you know what happens if uh
um

06:16:37.490 --> 06:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:40.730 --> 06:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:42.110 --> 06:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
other than the state police I can't
 
06:16:54.128 --> 06:16:54.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:57.350 --> 06:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
but again
 
06:17:01.070 --> 06:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman I've got it
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh I've got a meeting that started 15
 
06:17:04.430 --> 06:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I'd love to get to but uh it seems
 
06:17:09.350 --> 06:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
like we're missing two things we would
 
06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
be great to hear from exactly where the
 
06:17:14.030 --> 06:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police are coming from and
 
06:17:16.730 --> 06:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
apparently we can't hear that now
 
06:17:19.850 --> 06:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
um and also I would like to get the full
 
06:17:23.330 --> 06:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
list of what's included in lines 13 and
 
06:17:25.090 --> 06:17:25.100 align:start position:0%
14 all of those
 
06:17:28.730 --> 06:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
types of employment so we we can know
 
06:17:31.490 --> 06:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
where we stand there so I would suggest
 
06:17:34.430 --> 06:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
we need another meeting and I would
 
06:17:39.048 --> 06:17:39.058 align:start position:0%
further suggest that since the OSHA sub
 
06:17:43.070 --> 06:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
um committee is going to be meeting on
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
March was it second March 2nd at 10 A.M
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:04.070 --> 06:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
everybody else Mr McKenzie does that
 
06:18:06.170 --> 06:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
work for you
 
06:18:08.270 --> 06:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is that he
 
06:18:10.670 --> 06:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
had very little time to talk
 
06:18:13.010 --> 06:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
in the scheme of things that's the only
 
06:18:15.110 --> 06:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
week we have
 
06:18:16.788 --> 06:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
I could probably going to try to stay
 
06:18:18.610 --> 06:18:18.620 align:start position:0%
away from scheduling anything
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
because we're going to get handed pretty
 
06:18:21.830 --> 06:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
good next week
 
06:18:21.840 --> 06:18:23.448 align:start position:0%
good next week
here

06:18:23.448 --> 06:18:23.458 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:18:26.208 --> 06:18:26.218 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm trying to cop that out and
 
06:18:28.548 --> 06:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
hold on to that few Nations let's retain
 
06:18:30.110 --> 06:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
it themselves
 
06:18:31.970 --> 06:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
but I'll try to make it existing a
 
06:18:31.980 --> 06:18:35.150 align:start position:0%
but I'll try to make it existing a
message

06:18:35.150 --> 06:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:37.490 --> 06:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
I know that representative Susie will be
 
06:18:40.128 --> 06:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
here for the other uh committee meeting
 
06:18:43.310 --> 06:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
so if uh representative McKenzie you
 
06:18:44.750 --> 06:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
can't I would suggest that perhaps
 
06:18:47.990 --> 06:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative soucy could stand in in
 
06:18:50.170 --> 06:18:50.180 align:start position:0%
your place
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bellini
 
06:18:54.770 --> 06:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um who prepared
 
06:18:58.490 --> 06:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
the handout that we were just given
 
06:19:01.670 --> 06:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is a this is a document that the
 
06:19:03.770 --> 06:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
therapeutic canops program has posted on
 
06:19:05.208 --> 06:19:05.218 align:start position:0%
our on our website um as an
 
06:19:05.218 --> 06:19:06.350 align:start position:0%
our on our website um as an
informational

06:19:06.350 --> 06:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
informational
 
06:19:08.990 --> 06:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
um document for uh for patients um and
 
06:19:09.000 --> 06:19:10.250 align:start position:0%
um document for uh for patients um and
caregivers

06:19:10.250 --> 06:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
caregivers
 
06:19:12.170 --> 06:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
um and what this there's there's no
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation in this document it is
 
06:19:14.400 --> 06:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
interpretation in this document it is
simply

06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
simply
 
06:19:20.410 --> 06:19:20.420 align:start position:0%
um collecting the bits of law in 126x
 
06:19:23.330 --> 06:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
including and especially uh Roman
 
06:19:25.910 --> 06:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
section three that established these
 
06:19:25.920 --> 06:19:28.548 align:start position:0%
section three that established these
limitations

06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
06:19:31.670 --> 06:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
um uh and your protections as a patient
 
06:19:35.750 --> 06:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so in my opinion it is clear to
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
go to the law X3 and read that then read
 
06:19:40.730 --> 06:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
this document what this does is puts
 
06:19:43.610 --> 06:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
your uh patient protections and patient
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
prohibitions limitations in in what in
 
06:19:47.890 --> 06:19:47.900 align:start position:0%
one place
 
06:19:49.850 --> 06:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
there's a therapeutic cannabis program
 
06:19:51.770 --> 06:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
document that we make available
 
06:19:53.510 --> 06:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um I had something revised
 
06:19:55.970 --> 06:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
since 11 15. the law has not changed in
 
06:19:59.030 --> 06:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
disregard since it was passed
 
06:20:00.530 --> 06:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay because there have been no there
 
06:20:01.788 --> 06:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
have been no improvements there have
 
06:20:03.890 --> 06:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
been no additional protections and there
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
have been no additional prohibitions
 
06:20:08.208 --> 06:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
since the law uh since the law passed in
 
06:20:11.208 --> 06:20:11.218 align:start position:0%
2013 this document the program was
 
06:20:16.250 --> 06:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:18.670 --> 06:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's pretty brilliant kind of popular
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's making reference to
 
06:20:21.600 --> 06:20:22.910 align:start position:0%
it's it's making reference to
um

06:20:22.910 --> 06:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:25.850 --> 06:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
other laws that were changed Through The
 
06:20:27.590 --> 06:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
Years 2016
 
06:20:27.600 --> 06:20:28.310 align:start position:0%
Years 2016
um

06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:33.650 --> 06:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
was 247 colon 5 and 6 uh 2021 at 16 and
 
06:20:37.850 --> 06:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
21 you have 9 21 122 colon 19 as well
 
06:20:40.010 --> 06:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
with those with those any substantial
 
06:20:43.010 --> 06:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
changes I don't I'm not seeing what's on
 
06:20:44.330 --> 06:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
the back of the
 
06:20:48.230 --> 06:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's on the part of 126 colon 3 for the
 
06:20:48.240 --> 06:20:49.128 align:start position:0%
it's on the part of 126 colon 3 for the
sources

06:20:49.128 --> 06:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
sources
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure we're getting
 
06:20:55.430 --> 06:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:58.010 --> 06:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing where you're referring to
 
06:21:01.310 --> 06:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
um under the section 126 where it says
 
06:21:01.320 --> 06:21:03.530 align:start position:0%
um under the section 126 where it says
sources

06:21:03.530 --> 06:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
sources
 
06:21:04.910 --> 06:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you're actually I don't know what we
 
06:21:06.890 --> 06:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
just I I perhaps we were handed out to
 
06:21:08.570 --> 06:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
different things I'm looking at a
 
06:21:09.948 --> 06:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
document called therapeutic cannabis
 
06:21:11.810 --> 06:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
program the protections and prohibitions
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
for qualifying occasions right I'm
 
06:21:17.288 --> 06:21:17.298 align:start position:0%
looking at 126 colon 3x X colon 3.
 
06:21:20.090 --> 06:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
right yep it's just it was updates and I
 
06:21:20.990 --> 06:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're here
 
06:21:23.208 --> 06:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
we're still had the same I will I will
 
06:21:24.590 --> 06:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
review this document again to make sure
 
06:21:26.690 --> 06:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
that this is the right one but uh
 
06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
changes to to those sections of the law
 
06:21:30.530 --> 06:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
I do not believe impact this document
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you just
 
06:21:36.770 --> 06:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:36.780 --> 06:21:37.930 align:start position:0%
 
I

06:21:37.930 --> 06:21:37.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:21:40.128 --> 06:21:40.138 align:start position:0%
just want to say one last thing thank
 
06:21:41.628 --> 06:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
you for your thoughtful questions and
 
06:21:43.310 --> 06:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
your interest in this topic
 
06:21:44.628 --> 06:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
um like I said the department doesn't
 
06:21:46.850 --> 06:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
take a position but it is an important
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
issue for offer patients and I
 
06:21:50.628 --> 06:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate the care with which you're uh
 
06:21:53.150 --> 06:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
