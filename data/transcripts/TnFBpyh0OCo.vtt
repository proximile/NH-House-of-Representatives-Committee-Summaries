00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone i've been told
 
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
that the live streaming
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
apparatus in this room begins operation
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
promptly at the time that the committee

session is scheduled for
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
therefore i'm assuming that the live
 
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
stream is now live and so we are going
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
so the agenda for today is we have five
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
bills to hear
 
00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
we'll talk a little bit about the first
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
one in a minute
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
we have four bills scheduled starting at
 
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
12 30
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
1 30 2 30 and 3 30.
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it is always our goal to be complete
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that is our agenda for today
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to talk a little bit more
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
about our first bill in a minute
 
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
before i do that though i want to remind
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee about
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
microphone etiquette
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
it is always important for you to turn
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
your mic on before you speak
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
get fairly close to the mic before you
 
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.430 align:start position:0%
get fairly close to the mic before you
speak

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
if you sit
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
way back here
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to be able to hear
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
you as effectively as if you sit here
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
after you spin it finish speaking
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
please turn your mic off
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
that's our mike etiquette
 
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
lesson for today
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to remind committee
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
members of our committee procedures for
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
conducting these hearings
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
we are all aware that we're here to
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
gather information
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
we're not here to debate the people who
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
are presenting information we're not
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
here to debate each other
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
all we're here to do today is ask
 
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.070 align:start position:0%
all we're here to do today is ask
questions

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
questions
and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
listen carefully to the answers to
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
accumulate information about the
 
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.310 align:start position:0%
accumulate information about the
subjects

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
and now on to our first meeting our
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to open the public hearing
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
1644 which is relative to the placement
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
of telecommunications antenna
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
and establishing a registry for
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
residents who are experiencing
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
biological symptoms
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
now i would remind everybody who is
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify and we have 20 pink
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
cards indicating there are 20 people who
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
want to testify today
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
i would remind everyone that this is the
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking for scientific data and
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
to support the reasoning behind this
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill we're not particularly interested
 
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.590 align:start position:0%
bill we're not particularly interested
in

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
people's personal health experiences
 
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
unless they can be backed up with
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
scientific data from a doctor or a
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
research lab
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
to verify that their medical conditions
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
are caused
 
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.310 align:start position:0%
are caused
by

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
exposure to
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
cell phone towers and other sources of
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
smart meters and other sources of
 
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.590 align:start position:0%
smart meters and other sources of
radiation

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
because we have so many people signed up
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to impose limits on
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
people's testimony
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
so to begin our
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
session this morning we're going to
 
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
session this morning we're going to
allow

minutes
to

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that everybody who

testifies will be given three minutes to
 
00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.990 align:start position:0%
testifies will be given three minutes to
testify

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
so summarize your testimony as
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
succinctly as possible
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
in order to give us a chance to get
 
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
in order to give us a chance to get
through

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
all 20 people who want to testify here
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
21 people now i guess
 
00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
21 people now i guess
so

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.790 align:start position:0%
cutting off this hearing at 11 30 this
morning

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
if there
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
if everybody who has signed up to
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
testify has testified by 11 30 then fine
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
if there are still people who want to
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
testify once we get to 11 30 we will
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
resist recess
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
this public hearing and we will resume
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
it at a later date
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
and that date will be published in the
 
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.790 align:start position:0%
and that date will be published in the
calendar

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
so that everybody will know just exactly
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
when to return to this room to complete
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
their testimony on the bill
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
so with that introduction i would now
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
like to turn it over to representative
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
patrick abrami to introduce house bill
 
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
patrick abrami to introduce house bill
1644.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
1644.
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh for the record uh
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
statement pata brahmi
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
rockingham 19 stratum
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill has to do with cell tower
 
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
this bill has to do with cell tower
placement

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
placement
 
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
placement
actually

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
antenna placement
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
because these antennas go on things
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
other than towers as well
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
and about a registry for radio frequency
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
sensitive residents
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
before i discuss the details of the bill
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
let's talk big picture
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to say out front that we
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
love our cell phones
 
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
this is nothing to do about that but we
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
should as a state ensure the technology
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
around us is safe
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
as practically possible
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
with this bill cell phones will live on
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
how many members of this committee would
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
be happy
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
with a cell tower going up at the edge
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
of their property line
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
and not being able to stop it
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
this happens
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
frequently in our state
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
where residents find themselves
 
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.270 align:start position:0%
where residents find themselves
hopelessly

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
hopelessly
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
without any recourse but to accept a
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
cell tower going up near their property
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
my experience in my town shows that
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
this happens all the time in my my
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods in stratham my residents
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
call me
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at a new cell tower
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
and most residents argue aesthetics
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
property values
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
but most important health concerns
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
one recent case
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
that i was involved in in our planning
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
board we had an electrical engineer who
 
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.070 align:start position:0%
board we had an electrical engineer who
was

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
arguing the health concerns
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh but he didn't get very far why didn't
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
he get very far
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
those town planning boards eventually
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
give in
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
because the fcc is all-powerful because
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the 1996 telecommunication act
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
before the 2019-20 term the issue of
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
radio frequency radiation was brought to
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
my attention especially with the
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
emergence of 5g
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
i felt filed a bill to examine this
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
that bill to a former commission passed
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and on the floor it passed the senate
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
health and human service committee and
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
and passed on the senate floor and the
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
governor signed it that commission
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
chaired by me met 14
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
for 14 months produced a 390 page report
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
that includes the appendices in the
 
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.389 align:start position:0%
that includes the appendices in the
minutes

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
included before you uh on your desk
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
that has been cited around the country
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
and even in federal court case
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the wording of our bill
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
formed the commission that several
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
several other states have as well
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
here were the major conclusions the
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
federal government and specifically the
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
fcc and fda have ignored the science
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
from around the world on negative
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
effects of radiation
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
we reached out to the fcc and the fda
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
who responded but never answered our
 
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
who responded but never answered our
questions

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
the epa basically when we reached out to
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
them the epa basically said not our job
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
and besides we have no funding to study
 
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
and besides we have no funding to study
this

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
so basically there's really no one in
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government that is
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
on the health level
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
our conclusion was that
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
that one needs to ensure safety of
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
citizens against over exposure to rf
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
radiation and we concluded that the
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire needs to to
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
control its own destiny
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
we concluded that beyond the health
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
issues it returned some control to the
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
state of its political and its political
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
subdivisions just from a planning
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint alone should occur
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
note that note that countries and cities
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
around the world are also dealing with
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
most already have stricter standards on
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
rf radiation than we do
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the u.s many cities and towns
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
are working different ordinances to
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
attempt to retake control of this issue
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
some have been challenged and others
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
have not
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is why if you check your your
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislative email
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
you will find letters of support from
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
around the country and the world
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
in the state of california the
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
firefighters have lobbied for and
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
achieved exemptions from forced
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
placement of cell towers
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
on their fire stations because of health
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
concerns from radiation
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
of radiation the 2015 california
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
assembly bill 57 used the phrase due to
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
the unique duties and infrastructure
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for swift and effective
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
deployment of firefighters
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
to get around the fcc
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that no cell antennas could be placed
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
on or near any fire station
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
so they came up with a way of getting
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
around the fcc
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
so it can be done
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
in the news recently
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
is the one federal agency the federal
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%

devices that are calculate altitude
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
could become
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
unreliable if aircraft get too close to
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
5g towers
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
with that the cell companies have agreed
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
to delay
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
the turning on of the 5g service near
 
00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
the turning on of the 5g service near
airports

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
airports
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
there was never a concern with 2g 3g or
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
4g just as the fte
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
just as the faa is concerned thousands
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
of scientists are warning
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
as we go further up the electromagnetic
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
spectrum using higher frequency waves
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
and power density
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
as 5g does
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
there will be negative impacts the waves
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
can alter optimum intermediate readings
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
then what can they do increase

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
courts have said that the fcc's
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
interpretation of science
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
to me ignoring the science is arbitrary
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
and capricious
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
it is a wake-up call
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
2019 2019 that their radio frequency
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
emission safety guidelines dating back
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
to 1996 were adequate to protect the
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
public was arbitrary and capricious
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
in its failure to respond to
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
record evidence
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
and in the violation of federal aviation
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
procedure act
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
specifically the court said and then
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
what's in quotes
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
is the actual
 
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
is the actual
was

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
actually in the ruling that failure
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
undermines the commissions
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
meaning the the uh
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.629 align:start position:0%
the uh
fcc

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
fcc
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
concludes regarding the adequacy
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
of its testing procedures particularly
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
as it relates to children as conclusions
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
regarding the implications of long-term
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
exposure to radio frequency radiation
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
exposure to radio frequency pulsation
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
and modulation
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
and and the implications of technology
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
developments that have occurred since
 
00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
developments that have occurred since
1996

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
1996
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
all of which depend on the premise that
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
exposure to radio frequency
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
at the levels below its current
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
limits causes no negative health effects
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
accordingly we find those conclusions
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and capricious as well finally
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
we find the commission's order arbitrary
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
and capricious
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
in its complete failure to respond to
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
comments concerning environmental harm
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
caused by radio frequency radiation
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
so that's the conclusion of the
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
court of appeals in the d.c district
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
i was going to read this today but i
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
guess i don't have time
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
this this it's on your desk
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
from the executive director of
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
environment health trust who filed one
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the people who filed the court case
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
that does a lot more explaining of what
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's again that's before you
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
so now let's discuss the bill
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
the first page
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
the first two
 
00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
the first two
two

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
two pages plus the top of the next page
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
is really the
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
is really the purpose statement
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
and at the end we conclude public health
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
and safety is the primary responsibility
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
of local and state government
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state's rights in this case should
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
not be superseded by the federal
 
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.389 align:start position:0%
not be superseded by the federal
government

00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
the first of two things in this bill
 
00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:34.949 align:start position:0%
the first of two things in this bill
does

00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
is the is talks about a
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
telecommunications antenna placement
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
and this is on the top of
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
of page three
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
line starts at line six i'll just read
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
it to you because it's only three lines
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
the placement of telecommunication
 
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.150 align:start position:0%
the placement of telecommunication
antennas

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
antennas
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
on any existing structure existing pole
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
new pole or tower constructed after the
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
enactment of this paragraph
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
placed at least 1640 feet from
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
residentially zoned areas parks
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
playgrounds hospitals nursing homes and
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
daycares and schools
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
so first you're going to say well what's
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
why 1640 feet that's that's 500 meters
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
and that's where the science has shown
 
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
and that's where the science has shown
that

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
health effects diminish after 500 meters
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
just to give you a reference that's five
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
and a half football fields
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
dr kent chamberlain emeritus
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
chair of the unh department of
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
electrical and computer engineering
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
will be testifying on that
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
the the second thing is that
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
the second thing is that
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
is to set up a radiation exposure
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
registry to be maintained by the hhs
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
which costs borne by the operators of
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
wireless antennas in in the state
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's three points yes there are
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
people who are actually radio frequency
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the point that there is
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare icd code
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.310 align:start position:0%
for this
being

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the ways and means committee for 12
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
years i am aware of many fees
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
that fund things that are buried in the
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
cost of the product an example
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that there is a fee per gallon of
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
home heating oil that the distributors
 
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.470 align:start position:0%
home heating oil that the distributors
pay

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
for things like safe the safe tank
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
program that doesn't appear in the on
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
the oil bill at home but is built into
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
the price of the gallon that is charged
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
in our proposal this fee would be very
 
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.390 align:start position:0%
in our proposal this fee would be very
small

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
when distributed across all users and
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
and wireless devices so we're we're
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we do a similar thing
 
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.230 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we do a similar thing
uh

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of bearing the cost of this
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note indicates that it will
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
take 750 000 to get this database built
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
and another 230 000 annually
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
to to run this
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh it is our position that these
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
development maintenance costs are
 
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
development maintenance costs are
inflated

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
inflated
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
we can go to unh and give them a hundred
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar grant or less
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
to develop a database that would that
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they would gladly accept
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
we also feel that the maintenance in the
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
database could be absorbed the existing
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
pos staff possibly the addition of four
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
to six hours per week of someone's time
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and because they're there the bill calls
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
for well not the bill
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note says that they're
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
talking about adding uh
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
two people
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative abrami can i just
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
give me one half a minute please sir
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay one more 30 seconds
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
finally the idea of database is
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
independent researchers
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
will have access to the data to do
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
analyses we do not we're not asking hhs
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
to do any of this analyses
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing from experts and
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
citizens alike on the science
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
why six to sixteen hundred forty feet
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
the phase of the fcc and fda what is
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
going on in the worldwide and nationally
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
on this topic and how local governments
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
are pushing back
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair in conclusion
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
i know your committee will give full
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
consideration to this bill if they're at
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
the full commission if there's a full
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
committee work session or subcommittee
 
00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
committee work session or subcommittee
planned

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
i will i will be there to help in any
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
way i can and i will bring experts with
 
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.230 align:start position:0%
way i can and i will bring experts with
me

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
so with that i thank you for the time
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and and again the there's a couple of
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
handouts i i gave in addition to the
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
ones i i held up that
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
talk about what's going on
 
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
talk about what's going on
federally

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
why these things are going to the courts
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's because there's a failure on the
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
part of the federal government to do its
 
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
part of the federal government to do its
job

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
in regulating this it's clear
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
i'm not an alarmist
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
i i'm
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
that's not me but when you look at this
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
as long as i have
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know i've come to the conclusion
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
that that something needs to be done in
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
this area thank you mr chair great thank
 
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.830 align:start position:0%
this area thank you mr chair great thank
you

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to open it up now to uh
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee and
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you uh
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative abrami for your
 
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.350 align:start position:0%
representative abrami for your
time

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh just one question i
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
i know there
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
it seems like the fcc
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
has been looking the other way on this
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
is that true in other countries do we
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
something to look at
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
where they have
 
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.789 align:start position:0%
where they have
taken

00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
to understanding this a little more
 
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.909 align:start position:0%
to understanding this a little more
thoroughly

00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
well they have because they're
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
most countries have more stringent
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
standards than don't forget to speak
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
into them yes
 
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.149 align:start position:0%
into them yes
uh

00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
all i can say to that is that when you
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
look at what other countries have done
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of their standards they're much
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
more stringent than ours
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
and there there was science there that
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
they actually have science backing up
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
their standards
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
we have no science backing up our
 
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
we have no science backing up our
standards

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why the court case ruled the
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
way they did
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
because they were trying to say no those
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
standards we set back in 1996 is still
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay today in 1996
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think we had 2g
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
if if that
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
now we have 5g and no one's no one's
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
looking at what the impact of that is
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
and and and the courts i think ruled in
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the correct manner that they did
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative thomas is recognized
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
aside from the health aspects
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
establishing the distance of 500 meters
 
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
establishing the distance of 500 meters
which

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
i believe is highest priority did the
 
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.070 align:start position:0%
i believe is highest priority did the
committee

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
study or run across any other
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
information involving how
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
5g would affect any operational aspects
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
of equipment or any other items uh
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
people's health not withstanding i'm
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
just curious if they found any uh if
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
they found anything in terms of distance
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
optimum distance and so forth
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
but yeah there are certain distances
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
but the main one is this the sighting of
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
tennis distance
 
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
tennis distance
uh

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
we also looked at uh
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
the environment in general
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
what it's doing to the bees what it's
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
doing to to to plants and all that
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh but we did we didn't address that in
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
this we're trying to take one step here
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
and really just try to get the setbacks
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
and by the way that setback we're not
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
going to disturb any of the antennas
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
that exist today that that that'd be a
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
possible thing to do we're saying let's
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
just look forward
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
and have a have a rule that says
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh that says 1640 feet
 
00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
uh that says 1640 feet
um

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
and which which
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
in just basically residential areas by
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
in residential areas as well as the
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
schools and all that that may not be in
 
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
a residential area so we we're trying to
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
be reasonable here
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a lot of land near
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
the road you see a lot of cell towers
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
along the highways
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
that usually there's not many homes
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
there it still can be they can still be
 
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
there it still can be they can still be
siding

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
siding
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
cell towers in those areas thank you
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr and thank you for the
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up so um
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
just curious in view of the recent
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
information that's just come out on the
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
from from the faa
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
at any time did anyone from the
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
manchester airport come to your
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
committee and discuss uh
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
issues with uh you know distance to the
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
airport and how it might affect uh its
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
operations no no i think that's just
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's really breaking news the last
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh obviously the
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
the faa and the aerospace
 
00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.669 align:start position:0%
the faa and the aerospace
folks

00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
have been looking at this
 
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.870 align:start position:0%
have been looking at this
before

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
people think that 5g has been deployed a
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
lot it hasn't been fired it's it's
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
getting there it hasn't been fully
 
00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:07.669 align:start position:0%
getting there it hasn't been fully
deployed

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
deployed
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
but then they started to see that
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's sensitivity to the instruments
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
from 5g
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
now there are a lot of tile towers near
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
current airports that are 2g 3g 4g
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
and that was never an issue
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
why why is it an issue now
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
because i think the power densities are
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
a lot higher
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're into millimeter waves and we're
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
just finding out
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
how it's impacting
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh instruments but
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
impacting instruments
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
what's it doing to humans
 
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
what's it doing to humans
so

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative jackie kelly
 
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.029 align:start position:0%
thank you representative jackie kelly
pitts

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
pitts
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
one question um
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
the faa itself is conflicted right now
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
about how many seconds
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
it they need to have uh these ins this
 
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
cell tower deactivated
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
my question is has the case
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
from the district court ever been
 
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.230 align:start position:0%
from the district court ever been
appealed

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
appealed
 
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.110 align:start position:0%
appealed
and

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
is it going to be appealed as far as you
 
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.789 align:start position:0%
is it going to be appealed as far as you
know

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
at this point it hasn't been appealed
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and i i would really suggest
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
that you read this piece that and
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's two two
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
this piece and this piece gives you the
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
whole history this one
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
and this one tells you what happened
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
with the with the court case in detail
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
in detail and it gives you what the next
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
step is going to be in the court case i
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to read it i was going to
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
read it thank you
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative nutter is
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
for taking the question it actually is
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
from a colleague who couldn't be here
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
regarding the 1.5 million dollars over
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
three years to implement a very tiny
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
database including hiring two
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
database personnel plus a 500 000 a year
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
support contract
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't this be built and secured with
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
something like google farms forms in a
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
few days
 
00:26:59.919 --> 00:27:00.950 align:start position:0%
few days
again

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
my bill didn't specify that it that was
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
that if we read it i can't remember if
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
it was the um
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
well we we recommended that the hhs run
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
this database because they do run it
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
other data i did talk to them a while
 
00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
other data i did talk to them a while
back

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
we never talked about the course the
 
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.710 align:start position:0%
we never talked about the course the
cost

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think they went to the department of
 
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:22.950 align:start position:0%
i think they went to the department of
energy

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know why the department of
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
energy but they went to the department
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
i i think they should have gone to the
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
to environment ep the department of
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
environmental service in our state
 
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.029 align:start position:0%
environmental service in our state
but

00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
with that said we don't agree with that
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal not at all
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
there this can be done
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
i mean this is a simple database
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
and and it's not we're not asking hhs to
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
to actually manipulate the data we're
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
just saying how's it in your your area
 
00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.350 align:start position:0%
just saying how's it in your your area
and

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
and you know we will make sure that the
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
data integrity is there
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then we're opening it up to
 
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.549 align:start position:0%
and then we're opening it up to
researchers

00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
researchers
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
to then
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
access that data and and do whatever
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
analysis they want to do
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
but basically what what we talked about
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
in committee was
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
that trying to identify hot spots in the
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
state where
 
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.029 align:start position:0%
state where
we're

00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:13.990 align:start position:0%
we're
using

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
human feedback as
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
as one of the indications that people
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
who are feeling sensitive to this
 
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
who are feeling sensitive to this
frequencies

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
frequencies
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
one of the things we had talked about
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
was actually doing testing because
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
nobody tests
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
nobody tests on an ongoing basis whether
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
even meeting current
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
if we're even meeting current levels of
 
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
if we're even meeting current levels of
of

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
of radiation exposure right now
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
but so we we again we could have put a
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
whole peripheral a whole bunch of things
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
up forth to the committee to consider
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
but we tried to narrow it down let's
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
take a step at a time thank you
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um same colleague who couldn't
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
be here today um said that he's looked
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
at a lot of studies and most of the
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
studies he's he's seen has referenced
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
are about
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
cell phone radiation and not cell tower
 
00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:11.110 align:start position:0%
cell phone radiation and not cell tower
radiation

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
i my question is what uh what's the
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
difference between the two
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
well your phone has like uh six antennas
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
your phone has six antennas in there
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
one for your gps one for your you know
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
for your phone you know there's there's
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of things that's a whole
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
other issue we looked at
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
again we chose
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
not to
 
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.470 align:start position:0%
not to
to

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
bring that forth we talked about having
 
00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.230 align:start position:0%
bring that forth we talked about having
warnings

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
warnings
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know on a whole whole variety of
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
things that we we thought that
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
would help the situation
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
but we didn't think it was practical for
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
just new hampshire to handle on its own
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's really a federal issue
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
now one can argue that what we're
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
talking about here is a federal issue
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
but we're saying okay new hampshire
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
let's be bold let's start with the south
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
to cell towers
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
and let's move move forward and coming
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
up because there are communities and i
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
meant to say this let me say this real
 
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
meant to say this let me say this real
quick

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
there are communities that are coming
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
about ordinances in terms of this
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
the only problem with the ordinances
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
some are and we're going to hear from
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
senator mccarty she did that in bedford
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh and there's others here that are
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to speak about other ordinances
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
the problem with ordinances is that
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
we're relying on the towns to do the
 
00:30:26.559 --> 00:30:27.909 align:start position:0%
we're relying on the towns to do the
battle

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
battle
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
and we don't i think the state has to
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
help them out
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
and give some voice to the for these
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
communities because let me tell you this
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
battle is going on
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere everywhere
 
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
everywhere everywhere
and

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes and i i'd say no let's not look at
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
the aesthetics let's not look at that
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
what's the real issue here the real
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
is exposure over exposure and again like
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
i said earlier none of you would like it
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
if someone put a cell tower in your
 
00:30:54.799 --> 00:30:56.710 align:start position:0%
if someone put a cell tower in your
backyard

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
you have one
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's why you glow so much
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
just joking
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett is recognized
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair thank you for
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question
5g

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
5g
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
is new to telecom but it isn't no uh the
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
fcc auctioned that frequency for use in
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
telecom what was it used for before and
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
did it cause a concern then
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
well i have people behind me that would
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
probably answer that better than i can
 
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.389 align:start position:0%
probably answer that better than i can
um

00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
but i think those
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
those auctions were for
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
they knew because 5g is a concept first
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
off and it's a marketing issue okay
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
every every telecom company
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
has a different strategy for rolling out
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
its 5g
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
and someone talked about small cell
 
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.230 align:start position:0%
and someone talked about small cell
towers

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
towers
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
and that's they needed millimeter waves
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
which are far further up the
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic spectrum
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
and so but they're way ahead even if
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
they were auctioned off five six years
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
ago they wanted to to to get get those
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the next generation but but you
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
would say well gee was why didn't
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
anybody test this want anybody to see if
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
there's any any health issues around
 
00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:07.830 align:start position:0%
there's any any health issues around
that

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
and that's basically where we're at
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.350 align:start position:0%
right now
so

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if there were other uses
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
for the 5g uh it's really the millimeter
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
waves again if you know they're like you
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
guys are science tech the electron
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
explains from
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know for 80 frequency waves now
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're getting further up the
 
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.350 align:start position:0%
we're getting further up the
spectrum

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
harrington is recognized for a question
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um referring to
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
page three of the bill where you talk
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
about the radiation exposure registry
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
it this is kind of really wide open i
 
00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.110 align:start position:0%
it this is kind of really wide open i
mean

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
radiation comes from a lot of places for
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
example if you share your bed with
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
someone you're going to get a lot more
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
radiation than if you sleep alone
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
how is this going to be limited to
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
wireless radiation exposure where
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's so many other possible sources
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
of radiation that could come from
 
00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.909 align:start position:0%
of radiation that could come from
anywhere

00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
well i agree this this is broader than
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
just the cell towers
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
i mean there are people are turning and
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
turning off their routers
 
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
turning off their routers
because

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
they're feeling the routers okay in
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
their house
 
00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:13.029 align:start position:0%
their house
uh

00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:13.830 align:start position:0%
uh
or

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
you know and we stayed away from smart
 
00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:16.549 align:start position:0%
you know and we stayed away from smart
meters

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
meters
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of people and believe me since
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in this i get i get
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
emails and mails
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
from people why are we doing something
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
with uh smart meters
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
and uh i know there was a bill a couple
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
of years ago on smart meters but it was
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
it was not
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
properly uh presented or
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
thought through
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
because there are again there's three
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
levels of smart meters
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
you know one is
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
the truck goes by
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
it goes on
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's one that pulses maybe a couple a
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
couple times an hour and then there's
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
the others that pulse continuously
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
and those are the ones we should be
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the ones that that pulse
 
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.789 align:start position:0%
concerned about the ones that that pulse
continuously

00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:02.789 align:start position:0%
continuously
so

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you can i follow up mr
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up uh yeah you would
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
mention the uh this fee was going to be
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
embedded in the cost would you because
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that is one thing that i really don't
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
like hidden fees that people don't know
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
what they're paying for and if there's
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to be a fee maybe it should be out
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
there so that everyone knows what
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
they're paying for would you be amended
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
to uh willing to amend the bills so that
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
the fee would actually appear on some of
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
these telephone bills so they know what
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're paying for
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
um yes but i would i would venture to
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
say first off
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
the costs i think are inflated
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
when you take a lower cost because i
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
think the state can do it a lot cheaper
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
than this but whatever the cost all
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
right right but but it's going to be so
 
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.950 align:start position:0%
right right but but it's going to be so
miniscule

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
miniscule
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
when you spread it across the number of
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
cell phone users or pad people with pads
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh end users
 
00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:52.790 align:start position:0%
uh end users
uh

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
and then we're we're saying well why
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't we do it this way like we do with
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
the oil companies
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
as one example is charge it at the
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
wholesale they would be the you know
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
verizon att whatever
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh level
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it's again the ongoing cost is on
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
even at the high end it's 230 000 with
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
two people but i don't think they need
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
two people to maintain this
 
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.510 align:start position:0%
two people to maintain this
so

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah i would yes sure if you want to
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative flozier is recognized for
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative brahmi on page page three
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
in regards to radiation exposure
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
registry it looks like it's up to the
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
residents my question is
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
right now is there any documentation
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance regulations
 
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.630 align:start position:0%
ordinance regulations
that

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
gives the
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
documentation for the frequency power
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
density dense intensity over time
 
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.310 align:start position:0%
density dense intensity over time
already

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
that they are they emit
 
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.589 align:start position:0%
that they are they emit
not

00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
not that we're aware of there could be
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be hard for me to see
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
with this bill going through
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't exist
 
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't exist
what

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
do they use those
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
that information against
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
well what is what is known though is
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
every every every antenna is is
 
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
every every every antenna is is
registered

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
registered
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
so we know what the antennas are there's
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
a you can look it up
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh so all of a sudden we because you
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
gotta remember part of the problem part
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the problem is it's one thing to have
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
one antenna what we we're just learning
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
about is how these antennas interact
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
with each other
 
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.470 align:start position:0%
with each other
so

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.270 align:start position:0%
so
that

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you could be in a neighborhood that
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
has a lot of antennas
 
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.069 align:start position:0%
has a lot of antennas
and

00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know we're not picking on anyone
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to say listen
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a lot of sensitivity
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the energy coming out of these
 
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.710 align:start position:0%
to the energy coming out of these
antennas

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
antennas
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
just just to be able to start
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
documenting this we have to start
 
00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
documenting this we have to start
somewhere

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
to try to start documenting then first
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
then we said well why don't we why don't
 
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
we work with there is an icd code for
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
radio sensitivity
 
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.670 align:start position:0%
radio sensitivity
uh

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
but not everybody and there are people
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
who are actually uh coded that way in
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
their medical records
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
and we can we can talk more about that
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
at some other time if you'd like so it
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
isn't like it's not recognized in the
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
healthcare arena it is
 
00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.589 align:start position:0%
healthcare arena it is
okay

00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative bernardi
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a question
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh mr brahmi um
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
my question focuses in on the
 
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.589 align:start position:0%
my question focuses in on the
500

00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
500
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
meter limitation
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh it does not appear to be tied to any
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
power limitation or power density
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh from these antennas so
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
light it can be seen for a certain
 
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
light it can be seen for a certain
distance

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
distance
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
if you cranked up the power you could
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably see it for a much greater
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
distance but you've just limited this to
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
500 meters
 
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.589 align:start position:0%
500 meters
what

00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
if we're concerned with exposure we're
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with a certain amount of
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
energy that's being uh distributed so
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
how how is a 500 meter limit controlling
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
this because what happens to these it's
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
yeah you're all right you're right power
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
density is the key thing
 
00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.310 align:start position:0%
density is the key thing
um

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
and you know we talked about in the
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
committee you know wow how do we do this
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
they cause they can manipulate the power
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
power density different times of the day
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you know
 
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.470 align:start position:0%
whatever you know
uh

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
so we thought the easiest thing to do
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
is to is just to put a
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
limit now there are some science studies
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
that will be talked about by um
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
professor chamberlain in a minute that
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
would he could probably do a better job
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
at answering your question if you don't
 
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:06.790 align:start position:0%
at answering your question if you don't
mind

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay but fine yeah and again it's not
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
the 500 meters isn't just we didn't pick
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
it out of the air
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
no no pun intended
 
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.190 align:start position:0%
no no pun intended
but

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's science behind that
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
all set okay
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question and i i do i'll do a
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up question based on
 
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
follow-up question based on
representative

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
bernardi's question so
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
my question would be
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
in reference to the 500 meter
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
would there be or could there be an
 
00:39:43.359 --> 00:39:44.870 align:start position:0%
would there be or could there be an
associated

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
associated
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
power limit
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
associated with that distance
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
if if regulations were
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
created and produced because um
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much power is created
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
to to transmit 5g but is there is is it
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
possible to combine the two in in either
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
your bill or some other regulation that
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
would uh set this record straight
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
for you before you answer representative
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
abrami i need to apologize to the
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee we have a rule
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
that says no member shall ask more than
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
two questions of a given witness
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i just violated that rule by
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative thomas to ask a third
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
question so i apologize for the to the
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
committee i won't let that happen again
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
i apologize chair i i interpret that
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
mean two separate questions but thank
 
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.950 align:start position:0%
mean two separate questions but thank
you

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
you
well

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
to answer your question that wasn't
 
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.309 align:start position:0%
to answer your question that wasn't
asked

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:41.190 align:start position:0%
asked
uh

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
uh
that

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
we would we would welcome that
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
discussion with you
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh to try to look at it because you
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
gotta remember on a tower there's
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
multiple antennas
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
i mean there's you've seen a tower with
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
one antenna there's usually you know 15
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
20 and 10 is all you know pointing in
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
different directions and all that and
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
then you gotta you gotta look at the the
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh the cumulative effect of all of this
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh is the real issue
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative abrami
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
for that thorough introduction to house
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill 1644.
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
before i call the next
 
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.270 align:start position:0%
before i call the next
witness

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
witness
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of operational
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
issues i neglected to mention earlier i
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out a couple of
 
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.910 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out a couple of
things

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative samsich and
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki are not here
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
today because both of them are in the
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
senate energy hearing
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock so i'll be leaving shortly
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
before 10 and handing the gavel over to
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
my vice chair
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
right now i would like to call to the
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
witness table
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
senator denise riccardi to testify on
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and senator i hope three
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
minutes will be sufficient for you well
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
with the constraints i do want to
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
preface that any science that i speak to
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
or any published document
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
the links have been provided for you in
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
my testimony so i will not refer to them
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to speak very quickly
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate that so um good
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
morning thank you mr chair members of
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
the committee for allowing me to testify
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you esteemed colleagues for
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
your work on this critical bill for the
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
record my name is denise ricciardi i'm
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
the senator for district 9.
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
i need to tell you first my personal
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
experience so several years ago i in the
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
town of bedford where i live
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
they were going to put a cell phone
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
tower in my backyard and the backyard of
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
our elementary school and i thought oh
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of ugly i wonder if it's
 
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.190 align:start position:0%
that's kind of ugly i wonder if it's
dangerous

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that's how my journey began it was a
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
three year battle and i've been to
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
washington and i have educated myself i
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
have a commission
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:10.710 align:start position:0%
so that's
why

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
i am here today also i worked very
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
tenaciously in bedford to have a
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
telecommunications committee and write
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
ordinances and do everything i could to
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
so as i was investigating the cell tower
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
radiation issue i discovered that while
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
information is presented by companies
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
that make it seem like cell tower
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
radiation is safe in fact there are no
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
safety assurances when it comes to this
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
radiation while wireless companies put
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
forward federal agency statements as
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
supporting their stance a deeper look
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
reveals that these agencies have not
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
looked at all the science nor have they
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
concluded safety is assured furthermore
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and most importantly the federal
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
agencies that the public assumes are
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring our health and safety are in
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
fact not ensuring safety long story
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
short there is no u.s health and safety
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
agency that is studying cell tower
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
radiation and reviewing all of the
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
research on which which to ensure i am
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
technology i do not want us going
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
backwards what i do want is safe
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable responsible technology this
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill is a public health and safety
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
measure to support towns across the
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
state so that cellular networks are more
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
responsibly placed i'm not suggesting we
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
remove this technology i really need to
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize this we just need to do it
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
safer and smarter i'd like to share with
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
you some facts that i learned in hopes
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
all of you can make an educated decision
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
the fcc cell tower radiation safety
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
limits do not ensure safety their
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
25-year old limits that were set in
 
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.069 align:start position:0%
25-year old limits that were set in
1996.

00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
1996.
 
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
1996.
this

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
state rules that say that the only way
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
this radiation can harm us is if it
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
creates heat please refer to appendix d
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
of the majority report in the commission
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
for ample science showing you that you
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
don't need heat to cause harm
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
wireless radiation has been found in
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed published science to cause
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
serious damage at not heating levels the
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
fcc and the industry promote reports
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
from the fda making it seem like the fda
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
believes cell phone tower radiation to
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
be safe this is inaccurate first the fda
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
has never done a formal review of all
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
the independent science secondly the fda
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
has no authority when it comes to cell
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
towers cell radiation antennas and such
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
they have not reviewed the full body of
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
research on cell tower radiation
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
um in fact the fda has
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
what they have done is put out a now a
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
now outdated literature review
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
only on the phones not on anything else
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
if you actually read this report you
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
will see it is not about the towers that
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
create the non-stop radiation exposures
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
day and night but the the cell phones
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
and and it's it's all it's all together
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
um but several health organizations have
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
filed a petition with the fda and the
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
hhs to declare
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone tower radiation and eminent
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
hazard this month the pittsburgh law
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
review published an article stating and
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
i quote the fcc and fda have failed in
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
their obligation to prescribe safe rfr
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines produced from wireless
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
communication devices to protect the
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
public health and safety
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
consider this
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
when i wrote as a member of the new
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire commission to the fda with
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions about specific questions about
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
the health effects of cell tower
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
radiation the fda did not adequately
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
respond i wrote back again with a list
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
of questions and i said please answer
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
them point by point please do not use a
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph that you have on your website
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
i actually had to enlist our
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
u.s senator senator shaheen's office and
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
they tried
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
they would not answer the fda wrote back
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
a short email without addressing any of
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.670 align:start position:0%
the questions
um

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't even
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
there and there is an email chain of
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
this in the new hampshire commission
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
report that you can refer to senator uh
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
i've given you some latitude you're well
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
over five minutes oh i'm sorry could you
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh wrap up fairly quickly thank you okay
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm very sorry thank you for that um
 
00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.390 align:start position:0%
i'm very sorry thank you for that um
well

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
all right there's if you have the
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of you there there is
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
a lot there and there is science and
 
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.630 align:start position:0%
a lot there and there is science and
links

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
links
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
but what i want to say to you is we just
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
have to ask ourselves
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
do we want this in front of our homes
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's a public safety issue and you know
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's done such a great job
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
for our our state and one thing he was
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
quoted and saying
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
in washington
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
the washington examiner the role of
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
government comes down to health and
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
safety so i want to use those words
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
as you educate yourself and you move
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
forward i truly appreciate the extra
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
time and really wish i could have
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
finished but i understand i sit you know
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
in the same seat you do thank you
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
senator that was an excellent uh
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
closing statement and uh i'll now find
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
out if the committee has any questions
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
senator riccardi for uh your testimony
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
um i you served on this uh 5g committee
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
and my question is when we had a 5g bill
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
there was discussion around the fact
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
that 5g seems to be a technology where
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking for more locations
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
than they've had in the past that there
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
existing polls that would be retrofitted
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
so that there are
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's sort of a denser network in
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
other words there's more to it at least
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding so i wondered
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
if you could speak about not just um you
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
know the larger antennas but whether or
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
not they're going to be leveraging
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
existing poles that might be integrated
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
in our neighborhoods for example because
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
i was curious about that well the answer
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
would be yes as a matter of fact i
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
started a wire and polls committee in
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
bedford to address this
 
00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
bedford to address this
and

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
that means no one can come in without
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
going before this committee and that and
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't single out the industry it
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
covers the board for anything that goes
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
on a poll
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
um the way it and i'm going to let the
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
scientists speak better so forgive me
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is just going to be me with my
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge um
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
5g is millimeter waves and 5g doesn't
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
work alone it has to be piggybacked with
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
3 or 4g
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
or it won't work it also doesn't work if
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's too high and it also doesn't work
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
if it's too far apart
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
so what they are wanting to do is to put
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
them in front of every other home and
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
force us to live in a soup of microwave
 
00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:28.069 align:start position:0%
force us to live in a soup of microwave
radiation

00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
and a lot of what's going on um is they
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
want the
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
cars that can drive themselves and they
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
put them along our highways or they also
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to be able so people can stream
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
movies while they're driving well or
 
00:50:42.319 --> 00:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
movies while they're driving well or
passengers

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
passengers
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day
 
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:46.630 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day
um

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
we do need the technology for our phones
 
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.309 align:start position:0%
we do need the technology for our phones
and

00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
computers but i ask you do we need to
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
stream movies in the car
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any uh representative
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
bernardi is recognized
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:09.349 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
um

00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:11.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's clear the food and drug
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
administration does not have
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
any authority to answer your health and
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
safety questions they're i've worked in
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the industry for 40 years their their
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
metric is food
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
drugs and medical devices so you're
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get an answer from
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
them however
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
the fcc when you have discussed things
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
with them i believe
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
they have authority in this area did
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
they give you any response
 
00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:42.549 align:start position:0%
they give you any response
no

00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman i
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
obviously we've had a lot of discussion
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to have more discussion on
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
the harmful effects of 5g
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
can you maybe since you were on this
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
commission tell us what's the downside
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
of not having 5z i mean my cell phone
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
works quite well right now and i can put
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
on you know streaming movies at home and
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
so forth and i really don't want to do
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
them while i'm driving but uh what's
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
what are we losing if uh is is there any
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
real big pressing need to have 5g
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
i do not believe so i believe you know
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say something i'm probably
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to get in trouble for this but
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's always about the money you know
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
when are we going to make it about
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
people and health and do our job and
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
protect the people
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
you can have technology without it being
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
that it's driven to do the automated
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
cars it's driven for those reasons and i
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
also want to add that um the higher a
 
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.589 align:start position:0%
also want to add that um the higher a
tower

00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
tower
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
the less
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
dangerous it is to you
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
this uh rollout if you will where
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to put the telephone poles
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
in front of homes
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
right at your level of your home
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
which makes it even more dangerous again
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let the scientists and
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
doctors speak to that i don't i i know
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
the information but not having that
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
credential i prefer not to
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
thank you senator i just want to
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
verify as someone who served on the 5g
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
commission are all the source studies
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that the commission used to compile its
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
information available to the general
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
public yes
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
our commission is on the uh website for
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
the at the state house and everything is
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
there the full report the the links
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
the presenters the people who came and
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
spoke to us um it's all there
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much and we really
 
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here to testify to
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
our committee here this morning thank
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
you for being here thank you and i'm
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
taking off for education so i apologize
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
okay good luck there
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna move on now
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
and uh i'm gonna call
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
if the gentleman's name
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
came out correctly it looks like his pen
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
failed halfway through writing his name
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
oh senator gray okay um yes senator gray
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
you can go next
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you we both want to get to that
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
energy committee
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
senator james gray i represent senate
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
district six
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
also on the committee
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
in fact 10 pages of that report that
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
you've got in front of you
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at it my name's right at the
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
some of the information you've received
 
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.510 align:start position:0%
some of the information you've received
today

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
talks about all of the issues that were
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
talked about in that committee this
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
bill that's in front of you talks about
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
antennas and talks about
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
effects on individuals and whether
 
00:55:07.599 --> 00:55:09.030 align:start position:0%
effects on individuals and whether
electro

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
electro
 
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.109 align:start position:0%
electro
magnetic

00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
magnetic
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
hypersensitivity is the term that they
 
00:55:12.319 --> 00:55:13.829 align:start position:0%
hypersensitivity is the term that they
use

00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
so let's concentrate on on the two
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
things the antennas the build the way it
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
is right now says placement of i believe
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
is the word they use
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
um does i've just learned here that that
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
does not mean that i can't have an
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
existing one there
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
but doesn't mean that i can replace an
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
old one doesn't mean
 
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.230 align:start position:0%
old one doesn't mean
but

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:41.710 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.270 align:start position:0%
it's
.31

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
.31
 
00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.950 align:start position:0%
.31
miles

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
miles
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that if i want to put
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
an antenna somewhere
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
i have to have a clear space that has a
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
diameter of
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
6.62 miles
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
look at nashua look at manchester look
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
at whatever and when we're looking at
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
this 5g stuff
 
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:04.950 align:start position:0%
this 5g stuff
that

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
the signals the radiation that are
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
emitted by those systems are smaller
 
00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
emitted by those systems are smaller
and

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
effectively they're they're trying to
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
preempt it
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
but i want to concentrate on the
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic hypersensitivity
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
what we would do to find out whether or
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
not that is a real thing or a bad thing
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
i will agree that the symptoms are real
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
the people are suffering from various
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
things but is it caused remember
 
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.230 align:start position:0%
things but is it caused remember
causation

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
causation
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
and correlation okay
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
is a is a big thing okay so we went to
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
the world health organization
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
and they said a number of studies have
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
been conducted where ehs individuals was
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
exposed to emf
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
similar to those that were attributed to
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
the causes their symptoms
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
they did a double-blind study
 
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.230 align:start position:0%
they did a double-blind study
okay

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
and several of these
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
and they found that there was no link
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
no causation there was correlation
 
00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.829 align:start position:0%
no causation there was correlation
not

00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
if while you're debating this first
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
thing you need to do is either expand
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
to all those other things that they're
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:57:23.839 --> 00:57:24.710 align:start position:0%
talking about
or

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
concentrate just on what the bill says
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
and what the bill says right now
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
5g is out you're not going to have a 5g
 
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.309 align:start position:0%
5g is out you're not going to have a 5g
system

00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
is there a smoking gun no there's no
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
smoking gun
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.430 align:start position:0%
the committee
has

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
not considered
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
some of this information because it
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet
 
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet
their

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.230 align:start position:0%
their
criteria

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to hear from
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
the university system i shouldn't say
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from a professor not
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
from the university system
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from lots of
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
different people
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:17.829 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative is recognized for a
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question senator and
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
i apologize for stepping out i have a
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
meeting at 10 and that clock up there is
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
five minutes fast
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
um so i missed part of what you had to
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
say and i really wanted to hear it so
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
could you please email it to us
 
00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:35.670 align:start position:0%
could you please email it to us
um

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
i didn't uh write it down ahead of time
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
so it would be difficult for me to do
 
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:56.630 align:start position:0%
so it would be difficult for me to do
that

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
they just told me i can roll back the
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
tape and watch it so hey
 
00:59:00.319 --> 00:59:03.190 align:start position:0%
tape and watch it so hey
excellent

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh i'm referring
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
to page four of the uh
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
committee rep of the commission report
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
specifically it says why does the
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
insurance industry recognize wireless
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
radiation as a leading risk and has
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
placed exclusions in their policies not
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
covering damages by the pathological
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
properties of electromagnetic radiation
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate on that a little bit
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
of regard to the i mean when somebody
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company when they come out in
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
a statement it kind of impresses me
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
because they're talking about their
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
money i can when people talk about their
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
money i can only offer you my opinion
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
my opinion in looking at the industry as
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
a whole if they can exclude it they will
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
is it possible that 10 years from now 15
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
years and from now 100 years from now we
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
will identify something that was caused
 
00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:58.829 align:start position:0%
will identify something that was caused
by

00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
well they don't know so they put in an
 
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.309 align:start position:0%
well they don't know so they put in an
exclusion

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
okay and the follow-up mr jimin follow
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
up go ahead so basically what i think
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing from you senator is that
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i tend to agree with your assessment
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
but if this bill were to pass as written
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
it would effectively say we're not
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
having 3g unless you happen to be in
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
some place in northern 5g
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
someplace in
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
coast county maybe in the middle of
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
nowhere for three customers
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'm being a little facetious there okay
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative kelly piss recognized for
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government is getting ready
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
to uh or has already
 
01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.589 align:start position:0%
to uh or has already
uh

01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated money
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
for rollout of 5g doing for
 
01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.030 align:start position:0%
for rollout of 5g doing for
broadband

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
do we know
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
if they're specifically when they're
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
putting this out if it's for 5g or if
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's for the lesser do we do we know
 
01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:07.349 align:start position:0%
it's for the lesser do we do we know
that

01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think that that goes beyond the scope
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
of the bill quite a bit but the rollout
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
of broadband
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
normally is
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
either via telephone lines
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh cable lines
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
or in some cases during you know via
 
01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
or in some cases during you know via
cell

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
cell
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh communications
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
so it could be a mix of any of those
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
technologies exciting i
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
apologize i forgot the satellites that
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
we can also
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
do it by satellites
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
so you know for the questions senator
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
greg thank you so much for an excellent
 
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.549 align:start position:0%
greg thank you so much for an excellent
presentation

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's a mr ken chamberlin
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
to speak next please hello
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here representing the university
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire i served on the
 
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.950 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire i served on the
commission

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i'm just going to hand these out
 
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i'm just going to hand these out
first

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm kent chamberlain
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
i served on the commission and as
 
01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:22.230 align:start position:0%
i served on the commission and as
professor

01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
professor
 
01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.190 align:start position:0%
professor
doctor

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'll get it right yet
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
as representative abrami mentioned uh i
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
was chair of the department of
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
electrical and computer engineering at
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
the time that i served on the commission
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
i've worked for quite a few 25 over 25
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
sponsored research programs outside of
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
the university i've worked for industry
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
and government agencies like the federal
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
aviation administration
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
so if anything my bias has been for
 
01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
so if anything my bias has been for
technology

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that my purpose
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
here in speaking i had prepared a much
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
larger presentation as you can see from
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
the number of slides i understand that i
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't have time right now
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
to give my entire presentation but i do
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
ask for a bit of latitude so that i can
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
go through the science and i know that
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's what you want to hear today
 
01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
the fundamental or if yeah fundamental
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
question that needs to be addressed is
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
why the new hampshire state commission
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
picked a setback distance of 500 meters
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
1640 feet
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
to begin it's important to note that
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
there is no perfect answer to this
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
question because of the the difficulty
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
in identifying what a safe level of
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
exposure is
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's also recognized that what is safe
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
for one person might not be safe for
 
01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:37.510 align:start position:0%
for one person might not be safe for
another

01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
that people who are electrosensitive can
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
experience symptoms of radiation
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
exposure at distances greater than 1 640
 
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
exposure at distances greater than 1 640
feet

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
feet
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
which means that the proposed setback
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
may not ensure a reasonable exposure
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
level for the electrosensitive
 
01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.990 align:start position:0%
level for the electrosensitive
population

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
electrosensitivity is real and it's
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
recognized with the americans for
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities act and medicare
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
different people have different
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
sensitivities to radiation exposure just
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
as they have different sensitivities to
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
sun exposure foods
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
such as peanuts and and bee stings
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
i mean my wife can go out in the sun for
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh for all day practically and and not
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
get burned i can go out for half an hour
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
and i get burned and it's the same thing
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
with electrosensitivity
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
so there are indications that the number
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
of people with electrosensitivity will
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
be increasing over time because the
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
background levels of radiation that
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
we're all experienced exposed to
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's rising as you every time you add
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
a new facility a new antenna your
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
background level of radiation just like
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
smog as you increase the levels of smog
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
the incidence of diseases associated
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
with smog increase the same thing is
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
true for background radiation
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
so a goal of the commission in
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
establishing a setback was to provide
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable protections for the majority
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
of people while not impeding the use of
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
wireless communication
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
when using their own wireless devices
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
citizens can maintain control of how
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
much radiation exposure they receive
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
those wireless devices include their own
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
cell phones cordless phones wireless
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
appliances such as printers and baby
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
monitors and people have the option of
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
turning these devices off if they do not
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
wish to be exposed
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
however they are not able to turn off a
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
nearby cell tower if they want to reduce
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
their radiation exposure one minute
 
01:05:25.039 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
their radiation exposure one minute
please

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.109 align:start position:0%
please
uh

01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
touch anything
 
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
touch anything
so

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
i asked for latitude
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
you are but you're wasting time by
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
explaining so keep on going
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
all right fair enough
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
so we're going to look at the reasonable
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
determinant i'm i'll go right into it
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be one minute so
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
if you i mean you're wasting another 30
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
seconds so please continue fair enough
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
one approach is to look at the adverse
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
effects as a function of distance people
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
live from a cell tower transmitter by
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
tracking adverse health effects and
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
determining how they relate to the
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
distance people live from cell towers
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
you can get a sense of where the
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
exposure risk becomes reasonable there
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
have been at least 10 studies that have
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
done this and i will be referencing one
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
of them in the next few slides you have
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
those in front of you
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
using these epidemiological studies was
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
one approach that we use to determine a
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
setback distance
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i will go right to that one
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be talking only about that
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
one study that's in front of you
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
there have been at least 10 studies
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
though that have looked at these adverse
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
health effects and eight of the ten
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
found the
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
exposure and identified the 500 meters
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to be talking about now
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
so one
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at in front of you
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
right now is a study from brazil and the
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
reason i'm using it is because it
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrates so clearly the relationship
 
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to find and that is
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
how far at what distance do you no
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
longer experiencing severe or
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
significant adverse health effects so
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
one important aspect of the brazilian
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
study is that took place between 1996
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
and 2006 and the reason this is
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
important is because a lot of people
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have cell phones in brazil at
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
this time this is a question that was
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
asked earlier is what is the effect of
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
the cell tower what is the effect of
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
your own cell tower
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
or nearby cell tower
 
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.470 align:start position:0%
or nearby cell tower
so

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
after about five years after the study
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
only 28 of the people in the region had
 
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
cell phones so what the study that
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
you're looking at right now is basically
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
only the effects of living near a cell
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
tower and not your own
 
01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:28.390 align:start position:0%
tower and not your own
devices

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
what's important also in this study is
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
they looked at a large number of people
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
over 7 000 deaths
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
for people living near over 800 cell
 
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.829 align:start position:0%
for people living near over 800 cell
towers

01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
towers
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
and these of course is a large number of
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
people give you statistical significance
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we have confidence in the results
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the at the chart so
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
the takeaway from that study and i'm
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
going quickly as i can here
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
sum it up please it's slide seven so the
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
plot you see in the handout shows the
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
death rate from cancer as a function the
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
distance people live from a cell tower
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
the red trace is for the population in
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
general the fact that that red and the
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
blue trace is for the population in
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
general and the red traces for the
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
people in the study as you look at that
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
plot you can see that the incidence rate
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
of cancer declines for people living
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
away from the cell tower
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
and as you get farther far enough away
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
of course the incidence of cell of
 
01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:19.349 align:start position:0%
of course the incidence of cell of
cancer

01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
goes to the same
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
incidence rate as for the population in
 
01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:23.669 align:start position:0%
incidence rate as for the population in
general

01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
but if you look at 500 meters you can
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
say yes there is a declining cancer rate
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
a significant decline that's where you
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
tend to have a break point in the slope
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
of that that curve but that is what we
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
identified as being a safe law or a not
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
a safe as a reasonable setback distance
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
force for mr chamberlain he's your time
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
has expired uh thank you for testimony
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
i've given you twice as much time as as
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
what was originally reported i
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very much thank
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
you uh may i remind the um before i go
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
into questions may i remind anyone here
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony it is far
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
quicker to just summarize the bullet
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
points on your written testimony than to
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
read them just pass it to our committee
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
and we can read it later this will save
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
time and get right to the point thank
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
you very much anybody have questions
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
here from committee
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
represent representative harrington you
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
recognize for a question
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of follow-up from the previous
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
discussions there you you put out i'm
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
looking at your chart with the 500
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
meters being sort of the break point
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
where the curve starts to level off
 
01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
where the curve starts to level off
um

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
and there is not a
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
huge degree of savings or health factors
 
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
when you go beyond that distance but
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
based on what we've talked about before
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
would you agree or maybe you know more
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
about 5g than i do
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
which you probably do
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh could it is it even possible to
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
implement 5g given that
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
500 meters and you know the population
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
density of new hampshire is it's not new
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
york city but there's not a hell of a
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
lot of places where there's no one
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
around for 500 meters you know you raise
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
a good point the reason we went with 5g
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
towers as well is that there is no real
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
defined 5g
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
5g can use the same frequencies and
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes does use the same frequencies
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
as are used for 3g and 4g
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
so in other words they could take one of
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
these small towers the small cells that
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
you've heard about perhaps the one
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're referring to and put in a
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
transmitter that transmits to the same
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
frequencies as today so we felt that we
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have those same signals
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
being radiated from an even even closer
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
distance so that's why we included the
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
5g towers in the setback now later on
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps there can be other rules that
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
can be put put in place but right now we
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that was the case we wanted
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
to get something in place to protect the
 
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
to get something in place to protect the
public

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman one follow-up go
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
ahead quick so just to get
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
down to the point here
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
do you agree that the 500 meter setback
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
would basically eliminate the
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
implementation of 5g technology in new
 
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.990 align:start position:0%
implementation of 5g technology in new
hampshire

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
no because there is no 5d defined 5g
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
technology 5g can use the same
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
frequencies they can call it 5g uses the
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
same frequencies we have now and it
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
works just fine
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't prohibit it it prohibits
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
it from using maybe some of the higher
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
frequencies that attenuate more rapidly
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
with propagation but no you can have 5g
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
and how much more
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
this new technology
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
would add to it
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's from the technology we're using now
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
so do you have any of that
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
hard data
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we do there are studies that are
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
making measurements in various cities
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
and the results are as i suggested
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
earlier is that you look at your
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
background levels of radiation and
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're steadily going up
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
just as if you have and i mentioned this
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
is uh earlier that if you have air
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
pollution is that increases the the
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
incidence of asthma cases increases also
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
so yes we have definitive data that that
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
shows that the background levels of
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
radiation from all of electronics from
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
all radiation sources is increasing and
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's actually been correlations done
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
on with correlations on the
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
level of radiation of background level
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
radiation and health and it is negative
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
correlation so the more radiation you
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
have the more likely people are to be
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
sick because it does suppress and we
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
have data that show that exposure
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
radiation depresses your immune system
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
my follow-up would be
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
is this new technology that they purport
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
to bring on
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is yes that if you look
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
at cities and this has been a study by a
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
doctor marga
 
01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
doctor marga
havas

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
havas
 
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.310 align:start position:0%
havas
that

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you go to cities that have 5g their
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
level their background level of
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
radiation is significantly statistically
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
significantly higher yes
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
see no c no further questions uh thank
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chamberlain excellent
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
next up is uh
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
mr michael roberts from dhhs

01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is michelle
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
roberge and i am the administrator of
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
the bureau of public health health
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
protection within the new hampshire
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
division of public health services i
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
want to thank the committee for the
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today regarding hb
 
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today regarding hb
1644.

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
1644.
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
as written the department does have
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
concerns with the registry component of
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation as noted in
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
the department's fiscal note and written
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative language requires the
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
department to create an online radiation
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
exposure registry and to provide
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
information to the public regarding how
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
the self-reported information will be
 
01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
the self-reported information will be
used

01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the department of
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
energy the department of health and
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
human services will establish fees to
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
fund the cost of establishing and
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
maintaining and advertising the registry
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation would require
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
operators of wireless antennas
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
in the state to pay fees established to
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
support the registry
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
in order to implement this portion of
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
the bill the department would need to
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
secure a software vendor through a
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
competitive bid process to obtain a data
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
system for storing the required data
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
an unknown factor that has an impact on
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
cost is whether the department can
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
purchase an off-the-shelf product or
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
will implementation of this
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
project require a custom design build
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to just note that the
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
department can't use a google system
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
because we are hipaa compliant agency
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make sure we maintain
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
that those security measures
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
we did provide a fiscal note the fiscal
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
note also estimates the cost with again
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
developing a vendor contract
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
establishing data and business system
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
requirements purchasing or creating a
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
data system software licenses and
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
required security provisions to be
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 750 000
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
in addition the department estimates
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing costs for maintenance of the
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
system to be 50 000 a year
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's also anticipated that we would
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
require two additional staff to carry
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
out the work related again to data
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
management security and privacy
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
requirements associated with the
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and those costs are
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
included in the fiscal note
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to just note that the
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
department has concerns with the term
 
01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.270 align:start position:0%
department has concerns with the term
biologic

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
biologic
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
in in the bill language it ref as its
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
reference to symptoms as the term is
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
unclear and open to interpretation it's
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
not clear if this is a reference to
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
medical symptoms or psychiatric symptoms
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
or both the department has concerns
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
related to the proposed registry and
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with hipaa requirements and
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
data validation as the proposed registry
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
is a self-report registry it would be
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
difficult for the department to us
 
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.590 align:start position:0%
difficult for the department to us
to

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:13.950 align:start position:0%
validate the data for accuracy
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.189 align:start position:0%
validate the data for accuracy
[Music]

01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
as written the proposed fees to support
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
the registry are to be established by
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
consultation with the department of
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
health and human services and are to be
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
paid by the owners of the wireless
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
antennas or tower towers the the
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
department does have concerns um that
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
the provo that the proposed fees
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
potentially could not be collected or
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
the wireless companies may not agree to
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
pay the fees and then there is no
 
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.390 align:start position:0%
pay the fees and then there is no
appropriation

01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
for this registry
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the department and again also
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
written there is no rule-making
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
authority in the language either to
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
establish these fees or this collection
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
system and again no appropriation
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
please sum up please yep so due to these
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
concerns noted above and as discussed
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor of the bill the
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
department feels that implementation of
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
this registry would be more aligned
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
through an academic institution for
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
research purposes
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that pretty much sums it up
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm available for questions
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much

taking my question
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
when i read this uh radiation exposure
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
registry section of this bill and i'll
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
try to make this really quick it looked
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
to me like it was open to and not being
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
derogatory but almost any kook in the
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
country or the state could come up and
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
say i'm getting exposed to radiation
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
somehow and i want this reported because
 
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
now it's making me sick is this as wide
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
open as it seems to me where there's
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely no limits on whoever
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
why ever someone wants to be on this
 
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
why ever someone wants to be on this
registry

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
the department understands that this is
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
a self-reported registry this is
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
different from any other registries that
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
the department has whereas providers
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
medical providers or laboratories would
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
be reporting information our
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of the language in the
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill is that this is a self-report
 
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
bill is that this is a self-report
registry

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr jim one follow-up so to be
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
concise then anybody who wanted to say
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
they're getting exposed to radiation
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
without any
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
proof or measuring device or anything
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh to validate that could go into this
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
registry and say yeah i'm getting sick
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
because i'm getting exposed to something
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this would be
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
available on the department's website on
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
their home on our home page and we would
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
have to advertise that um so yes it
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
would be open to the public um one of
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
the concerns that we noted both in our
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
written testimony and in my testimony
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
today is the data validation concern
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
because that is that is problematic for
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
the department to validate you know
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
because as as required we're
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
required to report out okay
 
01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think you've answered my question we
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
kind of get a line thank you very much
 
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
do you recognize this group of kelly
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
pittsford question i i'm going to follow
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
up with what i started with the
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
professor was that we
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
all here in new hampshire are exposed to
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
radiation of all different kinds
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
constantly daily
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
if i just say i'm exposed to radiation
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
that would be a true statement
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know fairly near seabrook down by
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
the nuclear subs you know
 
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.709 align:start position:0%
the nuclear subs you know
um

01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
so how would you quantitate where that
 
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.350 align:start position:0%
so how would you quantitate where that
radiation

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
came from that i was exposed to
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that would
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
would that be a problem that would be a
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
um a challenge for certainly yes i mean
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's natural radiation as well from
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony appreciate
 
01:20:52.239 --> 01:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony appreciate
it

01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
next up i believe is a dr lisa nagi
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
i hope i pronounced that correctly
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is cecilia ducette and
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
i will be reading dr naji's partial
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
testimony we'll keep it short and i
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
would like to pass it out to our
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%

my cv will be emailed to you shortly and
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
you will see that i attended the
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
university of pennsylvania and cornell
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
medical school and in board certified in

institutes of environmental health
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
sciences for you to review and you will
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
have that link in my email
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
i educate doctors and the public
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
including interviews on the netflix
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%

nightline and more
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
i have presented in congress and helped
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
to raise a hundred million dollars for
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
toxic exposure research for veterans who
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
became electrically and chemically
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
sensitive from wartime exposures
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
i was never taught in medical school
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
about environmental exposures the
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
chronic effects of chemicals or
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
radiofrequency radiation i learned it by
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
becoming ill myself and slowly
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
recovering over a 10-year period i then
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
went on to practice again and i now
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for those without a strong
 
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.070 align:start position:0%
advocate for those without a strong
voice

01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
voice
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your efforts to learn more
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
about the wireless radiation issue
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
although i know it is hard for
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
politicians and the lay public
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly not affected by environmental
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
exposures that they know of
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
to realize that these radio frequencies
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
affect us all in all of the cells of our
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
body at the level of the voltage-gated
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
calcium channel although we might not be
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
aware that our phone heating up in our
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
hand or heating our ear is evidence of
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
sensitivity to our already sick cells
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
decreased blood flow to the brain is
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
clearly proven to be slowed by cell
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
phones on a pet scanning study published
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
a decade ago in the journal of cerebral
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
blood flow
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
i will skip over a little bit of this
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
but i do want to say that in december
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
2021 the massachusetts medical society
 
01:24:22.159 --> 01:24:23.910 align:start position:0%
2021 the massachusetts medical society
adopted

01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
a wireless communications public safety
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
standards policy statement such that
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate agencies must research the
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
health effects of radio frequency
 
01:24:34.159 --> 01:24:35.510 align:start position:0%
health effects of radio frequency
radiation

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
and based on their findings adjust
 
01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
exposure guidelines
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
so the wheels of acceptance of the
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
danger of electromagnetic fields are
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
turning and it is thought that this
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
particular distance of 1 640 feet
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable guideline to start with
 
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable guideline to start with
although

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
although
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
the very sensitive will still need to be
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
further away from these kinds of
 
01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.550 align:start position:0%
further away from these kinds of
transmitters

01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
transmitters
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
we must train doctors first responders
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
and emergency room personnel that these
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
conditions are real the patients are not
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
mentally ill
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
and respect their demands to avoid
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
exposure to anything in the environment
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the ambulances in the er or in the
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals that make them acutely ill
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
please start some up please okay
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
professional training is available
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
through the emf medical conference and
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
in your packet you will see a letter
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
from the director of the conference
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
libby kelly
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
so please it is important for citizens
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to register harmful exposures
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the database you propose so we can
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
quantify the harm epidemio
 
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.270 align:start position:0%
quantify the harm epidemio
epidemiologically

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
epidemiologically
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
and further establish informed public
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
health policy and she welcomes you to
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
reach out to dr naj directly thank you
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much do i see any
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
sorry representative bernardi is uh
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh thank you doctor
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
so the mass medical society adopted this
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
safety standard policy statement has
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
there been any work that has
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
come from that about setting
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
standards no that was just adopted in
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
december but in your email you will find
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
a full resolution
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
and be able to see what they base their
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations on
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
well received
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
i would again advise everyone this is a
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
very important subject matter please get
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
right to your bullet points with the
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
time we have
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
is short and we appreciate get right to
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
the point please thank you so much next
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
on the agenda is
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
a beth cooley
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
beth cooley uh
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone mr chair and
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is beth
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
cooley and i am the assistant vice
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
president of state legislative affairs
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
at ctia
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
ctia is the trade association for the
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
wireless communications industry
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to respectfully testify
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
in opposition to h.b 1644. the proposed
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is flawed for two
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
fundamental reasons it is both
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
unwarranted and
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
unlawful as you know this legislation
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
came from recommendations from the
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
majority report of the 5g commission
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
ctia also had a seat on that commission
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
i want to start by saying i have a great
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
deal of respect for representative
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
abrami and in the work that he was
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do and we were all trying to
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
do us on the commission but
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the pandemic took hold and
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
we lost several months
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
as a result ctia felt the commission
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
failed to consider it in a balanced
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
fashion the well-developed reviews of
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
the science from the u.s and
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
international health and safety
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
organizations we indicated as much as a
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
signatory to the minority report which
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
senator gray referenced
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
now i submitted somewhat lengthy
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
testimony so of course i want to be
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
respectful of your time and i just want
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
to make two points
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
first this legislation is based on the
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
unsupported premise that the federal
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
communications commission the fcc that
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
their regulated telecommunication
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
equipment presents a quote significant
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
public risk that is what the legislation
 
01:28:42.639 --> 01:28:43.590 align:start position:0%
public risk that is what the legislation
says

01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
as detailed thoroughly in my written
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony the consensus of the u.s and
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
international scientific community
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
including the world health organization
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the american cancer society is that
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
there are no known adverse health risks
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
from the levels of rf energy emitted at
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
the frequencies used by wireless devices
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
including cell phones and facilities
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
including small cells
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
indeed when setting the limits for rf
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
emissions of wireless devices the fcc
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
intentionally provided a significant
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
safety margin 50 times below the
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
threshold at which adverse effects were
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
observed in laboratory animals
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
second this legislation is also unlawful
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
and that express preemption bars state
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
and local antenna regulations based on
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
rf safety
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
every court since 2005 that has
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
addressed state and local efforts to
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
regulate rf emissions from fcc regulated
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment has held
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
that federal law either expressly and or
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
impliedly preempts state regulation
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
based on challenges to the safety of
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
wireless equipment
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
specifically in the federal
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
communications act section 332 there is
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
language in there that provides in part
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
no state or local government may
 
01:29:59.110 --> 01:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
regulate the placement construction and
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
modification of personal wireless
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
service facilities on the basis of
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
environmental effects of radio frequency
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
emissions it is clear that that is what
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation is seeking to do
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
in addition the requirement to limit the
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
placement of telecommunication
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
telecommunications antennas to that 500
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
meters that we talked about would
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
inevitably result in a moratorium on
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
wireless deployment this is also
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
unlawful and violates section 253-a of
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
the federal communications act
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
so in closing the flawed science and
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
preemption notwithstanding which
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
candidly are insurmountable
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually in conflict of
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire residents report that
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
they actually want
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
a poll conducted by harris poll in
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
november 2020 showed nearly all voters
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
and 89 percent said it was very
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
important to have reliable high-speed
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity during the
 
01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.990 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity during the
pandemic

01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
and nearly 80 percent supported mobile
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
wireless upgrades in their communities
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
mentioning factors like increased
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
accessibility connectivity and speed
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 pandemic has placed a white
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
hot spotlight on the need for
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
connectivity in closing the digital
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
divide of which wireless plays a huge
 
01:31:08.159 --> 01:31:09.110 align:start position:0%
divide of which wireless plays a huge
role

01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
role
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislation like this h.b 1644 would
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
completely foreclose this option
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we respectfully
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
request this bill be rejected thank you
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett recognized for a
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
question yes i'm the clerk would you
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
please tell me what ctia stands for
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
when we were originally formed in the
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
80s it was the cellular
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
telecommunications internet association
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
now we are ctia everything wireless
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
our website is ctia.org if you'd like
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
more information so some of your
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
communications what cellular
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative mckee recognized for a
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um my question is
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law prohibiting
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
states and localities from having input
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
so there's a you know
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
super session
 
01:32:06.239 --> 01:32:07.990 align:start position:0%
super session
superseding

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
superseding
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
authority which is true on many of the
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects that they try to
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
of local areas to you know come up with
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
nimby or whatever
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me when that went into
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
effect like how long that has been in
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
place the federal communications act was
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
enacted in 1996. well i don't
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
i don't mean the federal communications
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
act itself but i mean the part that says
 
01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.070 align:start position:0%
act itself but i mean the part that says
that

01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
that that the states can't have any say
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
on um on the placement of uh for
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
radiation specifically yeah i believe
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
that was also 96. i will confirm part of
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
the original yes yeah
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
and just i mean i know you all know this
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
um to be clear that's just on the basis
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
of rf safety of course local and state
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
governments have have input in other
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes one follow-up thank you
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
since there is this exemption based on
 
01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.830 align:start position:0%
since there is this exemption based on
rf

01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
rf
 
01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.790 align:start position:0%
rf
specifically

01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
have there been any health requirements
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
met or objectives identified that would
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
allow them to
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
be deploying
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
technology that they understand to be
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
safe in other words
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's confusion around
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
whether there is enough knowledge as to
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
how much radiation
 
01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:31.350 align:start position:0%
how much radiation
uh

01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
exposure there is and uh whether that's
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
changing significantly with 5g and then
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know i mean it all follows from
 
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:39.830 align:start position:0%
you know i mean it all follows from
there

01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great question thank you
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative mr chair um
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
so the fcc
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the fda which is
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
considered the sister agency and the fta
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
regularly and all of the science is in
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
my testimony as well so i won't go study
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
for a study for it with you um
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
looks at hundreds and thousands of
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed independent analysis and
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
equipment from telecommunications
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
providers cannot be deployed until it is
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh approved and uh the fcc requirements
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
are met
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the safety levels so it
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
can't just be deployed without being
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
tested that it is safe um and again that
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
is why the fcc when they develop their
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
standards looking at independent both
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
national and internationally reviewed
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
peer research they set a safety standard
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
of 50 times below where they would
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
observe any adverse effects from
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radiation just so we're all
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
clear we're not talking about radiation
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know from a nuclear power plant for
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
example this is something called
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radiation which is the same
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
as your your wi-fi hotspot back there
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
just you know so we're all clear and
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
singing from the same song sheet
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
does that help the question it does it
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
can i just follow up on that particular
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
point or
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
i thought it was one question
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the next representative here
 
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.830 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the next representative here
okay

01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if i read your uh
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly what you're saying
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
is that the federal law uh prohibits
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
this bill from going into effect it
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
would nullify it but we keep talking
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
about 5g here and i'm looking at the
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill itself and the actual only other
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
than the radiation exposure registry the
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
actual thing that actually has anything
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
being placed into law
 
01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
being placed into law
is

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph nine on page three which
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
says the placement of telecommunication
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
and tenors
 
01:35:29.199 --> 01:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
and tenors
so

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm reading this to say that any
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
new telecommunication antenna
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
could not be placed unless it was at
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
least uh 500 meters or 1640 feet uh from
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
residential zone parks playgrounds etc
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
can you give us what would the effect of
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
that be let's forget about the federal
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
law for a second let's just say if this
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
was enacted what would the effect of
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
that be on the telecommunications
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
industry in new hampshire thank you
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative for your question mr
 
01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.590 align:start position:0%
representative for your question mr
chair

01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
there would be an extreme halt to
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
wireless deployment whether it's 4g or
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
5g or beyond and and that is a fact
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about small cells and
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
millimeter waves and that does provide
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
5g when you're attaching to a pole for
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
example 5g can also be deployed in a
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
different spectrum band on macro towers
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
as well which you think of are the 200
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
foot towers that you see alongside the
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
highway this would have a chilling
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
effect on investment in the state as
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
well as connectivity uh for your
 
01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:31.669 align:start position:0%
well as connectivity uh for your
constituents

01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:33.430 align:start position:0%
constituents
follow-up

01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
one follow-up question so would be safe
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is no new cell
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
coverage any place in the state that
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it already i think that
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes uh representative
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
flozie for a question
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and for your
 
01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and for your
testimony

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
everybody's referring to this 1996
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
studies fcc really but that's all been
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.199 --> 01:37:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
effects

01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
effects
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
so the do you know
 
01:37:10.239 --> 01:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
so the do you know
any

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.590 align:start position:0%
any
attempts

01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.470 align:start position:0%
attempts
to

01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.229 align:start position:0%
to
have

01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
other studies done
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
that involves health concerns that were
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
not thermal
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
so i know that in 2020 the fda i have
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers right here they looked at
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
125 animal studies and seven epidemiol
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies excuse me and
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
just last month
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
moby kids published a
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
the largest case controls case control
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
study to date of the relationship
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
between wireless phone use and the risk
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
of brain tumors in children adolescents
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
and young adults and they found no
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
evidence of a causal association between
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
wireless phone use and brain tumors in
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
young people so to answer your question
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
is yes these studies whether they're
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
being done
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
by federal agencies but the federal
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
agencies look at all of these
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed both national and
 
01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.870 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed both national and
international

01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
international
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
studies that are out there i would i
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
would also know and i'll get you the
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
right name the united kingdom
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
health protection agency independent
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
advisory group on non-ionizing radiation
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
and the swedish council for working life
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
and social re and social research also
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
agree that the guidelines of the fcc
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
limits have do not cause health effects
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
so this isn't we're looking at
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
everything from australia to the uk and
 
01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just thermal to answer your
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up go ahead
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
i thank you
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
co if this is not available could you
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
those links and information sure they're
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
all linked in my written testimony but
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to follow up with any
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
the chair has one quick question
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
curiosity we talk in terms of
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the 5 meters 500 meters minimum
 
01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.229 align:start position:0%
of the 5 meters 500 meters minimum
distance

01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
distance
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
is there a minimum distance
 
01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:11.360 align:start position:0%
from which 5g technology would not work
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
or or you would not get closer to i
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
should say
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that thank you mr chair i'm
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
not sure i can answer that question
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
because it's all dependent on the
 
01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:19.990 align:start position:0%
because it's all dependent on the
topography

01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
topography
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know for example um if we're talking
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
about mountains and hills or are we
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
going down i mean so this is you know
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
line of sight when we're talking about
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave specifically
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
um it can go as far as a football i've
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
heard of two football fields but again
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
it depends on topography it also depends
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
on the pole that is being used of course
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to be structurally sound so
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors to answer that
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
question so i could not provide you a
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
blanket answer i apologize on what is
 
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.709 align:start position:0%
blanket answer i apologize on what is
acceptable

01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
the question for the chair is that i i
 
01:40:00.239 --> 01:40:01.510 align:start position:0%
the question for the chair is that i i
notice

01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
and has been the the policy in the past
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
that there are members of the public
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
here who do not
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
represent any particular
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyist interest and i'm wondering if
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
we could hear from some of them even if
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's on an integrated basis as we're
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
going into the hour
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and a great
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
segue into my next speaker who happens
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
miss laurie
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
schrierer i guess i can't the spelling
 
01:40:32.639 --> 01:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
schrierer i guess i can't the spelling
is

01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
hazy and she's representing herself so i
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
i assume that's a member of the public
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
i am a resident of new hampshire for 17
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
years in west milan a rural residential
 
01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.629 align:start position:0%
years in west milan a rural residential
area

01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired attorney an advocate for
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
safe technology in keene
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
and i attended a lot of the commission
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
meetings and i'm also a volunteer
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
citizen scientist with the global emf
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
monitoring project
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
my interest in health effects of
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
of um emf started when i was exposed to
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
magnetic fields in my home
 
01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh there were stray currents coming from
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
a uh electric pole actually down my well
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
shaft and so i had a lot of magnetic
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
fields through my wiring and as a result
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
of that i believe that i became emf
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
sensitive and according to the research
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
and i link one of the documents
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
the more we are exposed to different
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of emf
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
in electromagnetic fields the more
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
sensitive we become
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
so the more we add small cells every few
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
hundred feet the more all of us are
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to start feeling some effects most
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
likely over time
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
and i personally do have symptoms when i
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
spend more time near cell towers or near
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
in wireless
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
environments which is not my home i do
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
not have wi-fi i use a landline i use an
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
ethernet computer i keep my cell phone
 
01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
ethernet computer i keep my cell phone
on

01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
airplane mode as much as possible i have
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
symptoms of insomnia ringing in both
 
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
ears fatigue nosebleeds sometimes in
 
01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.790 align:start position:0%
ears fatigue nosebleeds sometimes in
rashes

01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
rashes
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
when i am more exposed so i personally
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
have this experience not to the point of
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
disability so i don't have a diagnosis
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i know my uh
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
my i know my life i know my experience i
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
know where i've been exposed i do have a
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
safe and sound pro 2 meter so i can see
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
where there are high fields when i'm
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
spending time somewhere
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
i got the meter specifically also
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
upgraded to that meter because i wanted
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
to be a volunteer with the global emf
 
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
monitoring project and i did some
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring on main streets
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
in keene and also in other places where
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
i was vacationing and just so you know
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
but a small cell
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
that i monitored near a nursing home it
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
was about 150 feet from a nursing home
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
and it had and sixty six thousand
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter which is
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
very high a thousand microwatts per
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
square meter is what the building
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
biology institute recommends for outdoor
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
exposure and the elderly as we know are
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
very vulnerable
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
also i did some readings by the beach
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
because i was on vacation it was 89 000
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter from a small
 
01:43:32.870 --> 01:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
cell tower near the beaches this was not
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i will say but this is
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
what the utilities are doing and the
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
towns are allowing without intervention
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
by the state we need the state to take
 
01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
bold action
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
in keene i was very involved with
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
providing information on wireless
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
impacts and scientific studies and
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
testified before them when they were
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
considering their ordinance which they
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
have passed but initially they uh
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
instituted more they instituted a
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
moratorium on 5g because they saw the
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
science and they they were concerned and
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
they had the moratorium they said until
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
the 5g commission report but then after
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
about five six months they withdrew that
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
from in part from pressure for the
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
industry from the industry uh for legal
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
concerns not knowing um what the best
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
course was and they um seem to need um
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
to have more
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
state backing so they can act boldly um
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay their ordinance does only express
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
preferences for not being in residential
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
areas and for being up to 750 feet from
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas but again these are only
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
preferences and they're not requirements
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i urge the state to take some action
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
on this and as you know from the 5d
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
report the
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
emfs are considered a pollutant
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
a pollutant so when you buy a house real
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
estate agent technically if there's a
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
cell tower nearby they should be letting
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know that there is an environmental
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
hazard condition according to new
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
in in that vicinity
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
and this is all in my in my testimony
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%

matthews i recently moved to new
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire from pennsylvania early this
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
i was diagnosed with ems electromagnetic
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
sensitivity two years ago
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
this past december from a team of
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
doctors at the environmental health
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
center in dallas texas
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
i spent five weeks at the center
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
monday through friday
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
i saw the team of doctors and had
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
testing done on me
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
daily along with receiving intravenous
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
infusions daily
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
i was put at high risk
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
by a cardiologist for aneurysms
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
along with being diagnosed with
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
autonomic nervous system dysfunction
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
where my neurological nervous system was
 
01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.950 align:start position:0%
where my neurological nervous system was
reversed

01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
reversed
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
i continued bi-weekly treatments when i
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
got home to pennsylvania where a large
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
amount of my blood was removed and put
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
through an ultraviolet light and oxygen
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
was put into my blood and then sent back
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
into my body
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
this is done because my blood does not
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
get enough oxygen and also it helps to
 
01:46:55.119 --> 01:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
get enough oxygen and also it helps to
heal

01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
heal
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%

01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%

while receiving no compensation
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
i was denied disability due to the fact
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
the us does not recognize microwave

dallas texas

i decided to move to new hampshire to

i decided to move to new hampshire to

the electrical grid is lower and there
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
are far less cell phone towers than most
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
i found a home in a small town called
 
01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.629 align:start position:0%
i found a home in a small town called
stratford

01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
i chose this home because there is no
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
cell towers in the town and the closest
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
tower is four miles away
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
i also do not get any cell service at my
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
home and according to my rf meter there
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
are no radio frequencies picked up at my
 
01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.070 align:start position:0%
are no radio frequencies picked up at my
home

01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
for me this is heaven but for many this
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
can be an inconvenience
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
understandably so as many people rely on
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
technology these days
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with this technology comes
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
biological effects which are immediate
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
and measurable
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
and health effects which can take years
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
to manifest
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
this past tuesday there was a meeting at
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
my town hall
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
where the stratfor town committee
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
proposed construction
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
of four
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
cell phone towers to be placed
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
north south east and west coordinates
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
30 seconds please trying to stop one
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
cell phone tower from being constructed
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
is hard enough
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
but four towers seems almost impossible
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
when i heard this noose i got sick to my
 
01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.189 align:start position:0%
when i heard this noose i got sick to my
stomach

01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
stomach
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
i thought i found the perfect place to
 
01:49:09.119 --> 01:49:29.589 align:start position:0%
i thought i found the perfect place to
heal

01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%

01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
is as they say right in my wheelhouse
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot of testimony today on
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the biological and health effects of
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
radio frequencies rf
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
used by today's wireless data and cell
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
phone systems from people who experience
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
these effects but you may be skeptical
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
i too was skeptical of these claims
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
about high-energy rf because i'd never
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
experienced them myself nor had i any
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
reason to look for research done on this
 
01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:49.030 align:start position:0%
reason to look for research done on this
topic

01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
in my testimony today i'm going to go
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
into somewhat different direction
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to look only at the
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
at the the thermal effects which are
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
than the non-thermal effects which are
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
very insidious
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
now the claim was made earlier today
 
01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
that there is no evidence of harm from
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
any rf emissions and i asked myself is
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
it likely or even possible that high
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
energy rf at cell phone frequencies can
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
cause harm
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
i wish to tell you that millimeter wave
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
radio frequency radiation can indeed
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
cause harm and the devices specifically
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
designed for that harmful purpose have
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
been successfully built and tested
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
more than 20 years ago the u.s air force
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
began development of its so-called
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
active denial system a directed energy
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
weapon for crowd control which is used
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
uses exactly identical radiation to that
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
used in proposed 5g systems
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
and i will include the url for a field
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
demonstration conducted by the national
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%

university
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
this report notes such a weapon may be
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
limited in use in warfare by
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
international law but that no laws limit
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
its use domestically presumably against
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
u.s citizens interesting
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
the first u.s air force prototype was
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
about the size of two tractor trailers
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it used three and a quarter
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
millimeter or 95 gigahertz rf as a crowd
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
control device whose range was quote
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
greater than conventional small arms in
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
testing it could cause quote an
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
instantaneous burning sensation in one
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
tenth of a second exposure along with
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
first and second degree blistering burns
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
on human subjects for exposures less
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
than 10 seconds in one case requiring a
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
two-day hospitalization
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
the second military prototype was more
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
compact mounted on a humvee with a large
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
steerable antenna to aim the beam an
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
unwieldy concentrated power supply was
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
required to achieve the desired beam
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
range of seven football fields with a
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
single large antenna
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
but there is another way to steer this a
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
beam requiring no large concentrated
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
power supply and that is to use a
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
so-called phased array of small antennas
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
spaced a few hundred feet uh apart
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
the third prototype could be as compact
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
as the proposed 5g array of small
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
street-level antennas commercial
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
developers of 5g are already touting the
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
system's steerable concentrated beams
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's a feature of this excuse me mr
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
wells yes you seem to be straying from
 
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
wells yes you seem to be straying from
the

01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
topic of our
 
01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill here i believe the topic of
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
the job
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
discussions of the bill under discussion
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
i will do that thank you because you
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
have 30 seconds left yes this bill uh is
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
about the distance between the antennas
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the risk escalates rapidly the
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
smaller and more densely packed space
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
these 5g antennas are are placed it's
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
called densification current deployments
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
advertise placing an antenna and a
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
kevlar housing on every street light or
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
utility pole and the world's largest and
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
cheapest seller is the notorious huawei
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
of china why would we help install a
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
dense antenna system in new hampshire
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
that can do us harm that's manufactured
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
by a country that may become a potential
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
adversary and who has also written the
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
software presumably so it's hackable
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
over an internet connection
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
do we have a simple way to to prevent
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
this foreseeable danger yes you pass
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation to make it impossible
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
for antennas to be placed more closely
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
than 500 meters
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
and uh from our homes our schools our
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
workplaces and i might add from each
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
other this would be a good and simple
 
01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.390 align:start position:0%
other this would be a good and simple
amendment

01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much we appreciate
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
your test testimony today
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt is recognized
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
for a question yes thank you mr chair
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
does a
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
weapon deliberately designed to harm
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
relate to what's before us today that's
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
because it's an rf weapon that uses uh
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
95 gigahertz millimeter waves exactly
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
the same as what is proposed for the
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
high energy rf
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh further questions
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
for mr wells
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:54:47.679 --> 01:54:48.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
so

01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
when the 5g commission was working
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
together they were not just looking at
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
health but they were also looking at
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
security issues is that correct or is
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
this something separate and distinct
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
stumbled on
 
01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:03.030 align:start position:0%
stumbled on
well

01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
the charge of the commission was to look
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
at the possible health effects of
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
emerging 5g technology these health
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
effects could be weaponized and
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
therefore i think that it is a cyber
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
security issue because these uh waves
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
can be used to hurt people
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
and hurt of course is a health effect
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up follow-up another question
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
that i had wanted to ask prior but i'll
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
ask it here
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
is um we're talking about the capacity
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
um the impact of the
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
rf at the frequency that it's being
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
delivered but uh were there also
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about the
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
the constant repetition the constancy of
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
the emissions i guess is another
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
question that we haven't really
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
discussed yes it's going out but it's
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
going out regularly and maybe the
 
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes the real difficulty is that the fcc
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
does not actually uh bench test or field
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
test they look at the literature
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
submitted by the manufacturers so it
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to uh collect
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh time averaged uh power uh densities
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh out in the field and and these uh the
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
power density of these systems
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
varies wildly
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know billions of times higher at one
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
moment than it is a moment later as they
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
switch on and off and i'm sure you've
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
seen the television ads for 5g that
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
point out that it's a steerable beam so
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the beam's not aimed at you it's low
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
intensity but when it is it's very high
 
01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.030 align:start position:0%
intensity but when it is it's very high
intensity

01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
intensity
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
so um you know i don't think that that
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
prevention of these um closely space
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
antennas will impact
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents ability to
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
connect to the internet or communicate
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
at all but they will make them safer if
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
they're farther apart
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have other technologies such as fiber
 
01:56:52.239 --> 01:56:53.109 align:start position:0%
we have other technologies such as fiber
and

01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
light based li-fi that can do the same
 
01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.229 align:start position:0%
light based li-fi that can do the same
wi-fi

01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
wi-fi
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
same thing as wi-fi doing does right now
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
without using rf
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts is recognized
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again ken good to be
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you i
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
am confused which you know i usually am
 
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
am confused which you know i usually am
uh

01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
5g is advertised now and and
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
people supposedly have it
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
so what is the difference
 
01:57:22.719 --> 01:57:24.229 align:start position:0%
so what is the difference
between

01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
not in all technical but is there a
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
difference between the technical the the
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
5g that we're talking about and the 5g
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
that people supposedly
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
are using now
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
my phone is one step up from an orange
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
scan and i like it that way
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
so i i really like to know if you know
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
do we have it in place now are we just
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
talking about something that's here or
 
01:57:50.719 --> 01:57:51.830 align:start position:0%
talking about something that's here or
coming

01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that question uh as as
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
other people have testified 5g is a is
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
an advertising
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
name of uh of a fifth generation uh
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
improved new and improved technology uh
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
there are several different ways of
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
achieving that what's on sale right now
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
are the 5g handsets we do not yet have a
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
a densified array of antennas as
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
somebody was describing a little while
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
ago that are a couple hundred feet apart
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
when you do this you can overlap the
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
signals from each one of those things so
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
you get a very very high power uh
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
signal at
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
at one particular location and it can be
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
high enough it would actually reach the
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.599 --> 01:58:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
i guess i might i might be
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
asking the wrong person but is that 5g
 
01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:47.669 align:start position:0%
asking the wrong person but is that 5g
high-intensity

01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
high-intensity
 
01:58:47.679 --> 01:58:49.430 align:start position:0%
high-intensity
signal

01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
signal
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
give better reception to other people or
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
make it make the system more available
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
or is it unnecessary
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the only technology that can
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
achieve this purpose
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
but it it is uh it is both a higher
 
01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
but it it is uh it is both a higher
frequency

01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
more line of sight a more powerful
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
microwave uh
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
wave and it's a higher power density and
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
both of these things yes will give your
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
your instrument much better coverage
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
because it saturates even more energy
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
but it does the same thing to your body
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.109 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
representative

01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
somebody else had their hand up i
 
01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.589 align:start position:0%
somebody else had their hand up i
thought

01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam did you have your
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't see that okay thank you
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr wells
 
01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:52.950 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr wells
uh

01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
right i guess i'd like to understand
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh this whole bit about having
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
installations on every other telephone
 
02:00:03.679 --> 02:00:04.470 align:start position:0%
installations on every other telephone
pole

02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
pole
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
i live in a rural area but i have
 
02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:08.229 align:start position:0%
i live in a rural area but i have
a

02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
fiber optic cable to my house
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i have you know 100
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
megabytes per second i could probably
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
even opt for 300 megabytes per second
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
how does this compare
 
02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:24.830 align:start position:0%
how does this compare
to

02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
5g fiber has some significant advantages
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
one is that it's future proof
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
the fiber that is a light conduit and it
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
sends a light signal down that conduit
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
it does not leak out of the conduit so
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's not you can't intercept it you
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
won't get any radiation from it and so
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
forth if we ever want to upgrade that uh
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
fiber in the future what you do is you
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
change out the equipment in the
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
so-called closet that's attached to the
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
fiber and and you get your new features
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
that way so the fiber network doesn't
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced okay
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
all of the wireless technologies as
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
you've noticed over the years become
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know supplanted by something else
 
02:01:10.149 --> 02:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's more powerful and so forth what
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
we must not do is we must not build a
 
02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.790 align:start position:0%
we must not do is we must not build a
small

02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.669 align:start position:0%
small
cell

02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
cell
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
antenna array because the next iteration
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
of of wireless is going to be even
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
higher power
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
so what we should do is we should look
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
at systems that are safe like fiber and
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
bring those into our homes and into our
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
schools into our workplaces and and use
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
that technology because
 
02:01:33.599 --> 02:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
that technology because
we

02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
we know that light doesn't have the same
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
types of of biological and health
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
effects that
 
02:01:40.639 --> 02:01:41.350 align:start position:0%
effects that
that

02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
but part of my question was speed
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
is there an advantage over this 5d
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
compared to comparison no because the
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
frequency of light is even higher than
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
than 5g and and as you know there isn't
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
anything faster than the speed of light
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
so fiber is is the is the best that we
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
oxenam did you have one my question was
 
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
oxenam did you have one my question was
answered

02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
answered

seeing none i thank you mr wells for
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you and i will now

thank you
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
i will try and be brief
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
i have comments
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
but i know you asked for science instead
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
of just personal stories
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
i am here on behalf of the 17 people in
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
my neighborhood who was harmed
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
after a cell tower became active
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
your hands are not tied
 
02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
there is no preemption when it comes to
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
health and human safety
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
you are required by law and the
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
constitution to do something about this
 
02:03:17.119 --> 02:03:18.310 align:start position:0%
constitution to do something about this
issue

02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is unlawful and a
 
02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:21.750 align:start position:0%
the only thing that is unlawful and a
violation

02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
violation
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
is our government's officials failure to
 
02:03:24.239 --> 02:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
is our government's officials failure to
act

02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes we all want reliable high-speed
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
internet and how you heard this can be
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
accomplished is through fiber
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
there are no
 
02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
safety standards for radio frequency

safety standards for radio frequency
radiation

02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
not from one tower
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
and no established safe levels of
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
wireless radiation
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
from the cumulative exposure of all the
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
sources of wireless radiation we are
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
exposed to today
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
our tower was tested at 1.66
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
of the fcc standards
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
so verizon came to our neighborhood and
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
told us it was safe
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
these are thermal standards
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
not biological cellular damage standards
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
these standards that the fcc have from
 
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.510 align:start position:0%
these standards that the fcc have from
1996

02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
1996
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
are invalid and not protective of our
 
02:04:24.239 --> 02:04:25.109 align:start position:0%
are invalid and not protective of our
health

02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
health
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
of our children of our elderly of those
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
with pre-existing health conditions or
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
for any single one of us
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
these standards were based on a 220
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
pound dummy exposed to a cell phone for
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
six minutes
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
they do not affect for the fact that we
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
live next to these towers 24 7.
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
industry will tell you
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
that these towers
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
these macro towers are on the sides of
 
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
highways i will tell you that i have a
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
115 foot macro cell tower that is
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
capable of holding 48 cellular antennas
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
in my front yard
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
i have 17 neighbors experiencing
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
sickness and we have been called
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
collateral damage and the cost of doing
 
02:05:10.159 --> 02:05:11.270 align:start position:0%
collateral damage and the cost of doing
business

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
our doctors will tell you that we are
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
human subject experiments
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is illegal this is
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
not lawful and this is wrong
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
30 seconds plenty of science
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
we need to listen to the national
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
institute of toxicology the realm zeni
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
report and the world health organization
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
when it tells you this is a class ii
 
02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.109 align:start position:0%
when it tells you this is a class ii
carcinogen

02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
carcinogen
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
we need to listen to the fda who sends
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
letters to the fcc telling them that
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
they need to look at the biological harm
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
we need to look at our pediatricians who
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
are not surprised by the injuries
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
because the american academy of
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
pediatrics has a position statement from
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
10 years ago citing this harm and asking
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
for protections
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
because there is no risk management no
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
insurance policy and no help from local
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
or state health departments when it
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
comes to monitoring managing or
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
mitigating wireless emissions
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
something must be done thank you very
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
much did you submit written testimony
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
it is right here oh great it's right
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
here thank you so much and i know
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
amelia gillardy sitting next to you has
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
to go back to school soon so i'd like to
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
call on amelia right now and ask you
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
amelia if you could speak for three
 
02:06:27.679 --> 02:06:29.669 align:start position:0%
amelia if you could speak for three
minutes

02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
esteemed legislators thank you for
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today in support of
 
02:06:37.350 --> 02:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
hb 1644.
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
dr martin luther king jr said that our
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
lives begin to end the day we become
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
silent about the things that matter
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
i am here today because cell tower
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
setbacks matter
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
protecting people's health matters
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
the voice of my little sister and the 17
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
others harmed in my neighborhood after a
 
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
cell tower started transmitting matter
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
i have a dream that one day this nation
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
will rise up and look at the people who
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
are being injured by wireless radiation
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
and who have a medical diagnosis of harm
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
by their doctors and that instead of
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
treating them with shame and stigma our
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislators will deliver us the promise
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
of health safety and equitable
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
protections for all
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
i have a dream that one day be it in
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
sacramento california or shacktown
 
02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.790 align:start position:0%

massachusetts

02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
all people protected under the american
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
with disabilities act will actually be
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
protected because new hampshire was a
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
leader and passed setbacks here today
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
i have a dream that no one will have to
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
bear the high cost of legal
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
medical or relocation fees because you
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
have taken responsibility
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
in preventing toxic infrastructure from
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
being built in their neighborhood
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire because of the
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
work you have done
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
i have this dream today
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
i dream of a world where everyone is
 
02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:04.790 align:start position:0%
i dream of a world where everyone is
safe

02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
safe
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
where no one has to vomit in their own
 
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
bed or be forced to leave their house
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
and lose their home because of being
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
assaulted by an environmental toxin they
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
are exposed to without their consent 24
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
hours a day
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
seven days a
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
non-stop each of you here today have the
 
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
power to make protections from wireless
 
02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
power to make protections from wireless
harm

02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
harm
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
more than just a dream
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
as someone disabled by wireless
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
radiation we need more than your prayers
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
we need policy change and protections
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
i am imploring you to protect your
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
residents by implementing cell tower
 
02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:44.470 align:start position:0%
residents by implementing cell tower
setbacks

02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
setbacks
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
the time is always right to do what is
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
right and that time is now
 
02:08:50.950 --> 02:08:50.960 align:start position:0%

and i know you have to get back to
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%

questions of amelia and i have i thank
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%

02:09:08.229 --> 02:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized yes
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh to amelia it is extremely rare that
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
minors testify in front of this
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
committee and is very much appreciated
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%

02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i would point out that as
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
of this moment we have 24 minutes left
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
in this public hearing and i have 10
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
pink cards
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
left of people who want to speak
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
that likely means we will not get to
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
everyone so we will be
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
likely be recessing this public hearing
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
and resuming it at a later date
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to call on
 
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.470 align:start position:0%

02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:06.950 align:start position:0%
remember miss friedman you have three
minutes

02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
chairman votes uh
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
oxenom would it be possible for us to go
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
into the uh lunch period so that the
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
people who have actually come today
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
repeat the question please could could
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
we extend our public hearing into the
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
lunch period so that people who have
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
made the effort to be here today could
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's possible
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
fair to ask members to
 
02:10:41.599 --> 02:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
fair to ask members to
forego

02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
forego
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
an essential part of life
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
for example i intermittent fast
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
every day and i haven't not eaten yet
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
today so to forego my lunch would
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
require me to fast until dinner
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
and i really don't want to do that
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
before go lunch sir
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
only to cut down the time period
 
02:11:03.679 --> 02:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
only to cut down the time period
available

02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand the question but we're
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
not going to do that thank you
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%

early retirement home
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%

02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
months ago and settled in

uh everything was great until a week
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
before thanksgiving when we received a
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
letter from the city of keene director
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
of public works the letter read
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
dear property owner the city of keene
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
has received a small wireless facility
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
application from tilson tech for the
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
installation of a small wireless
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
facility to be located in the public
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
right-of-way in the area of three allen
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
court which is next door to us
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
tilson tech is proposing to construct a
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
swf consisting of a structure
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 feet tall
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh the letter went on to advise us that
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
the application and associated materials
 
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
were available for our review at the
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
public works department
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
um i then turned the letter over and saw
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
the pictures
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the 40-foot giant tower
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
superimposed on my neighbor's lawn
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the pictures were taken in such a
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
way that you could not see any houses
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
around it
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
it was taken from the point of view of
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
the house looking out onto the street
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the hospital in the parking lot in
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
the background
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
my neighbor's house is 50 feet
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
from this proposed tower my house is 92
 
02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:26.390 align:start position:0%
from this proposed tower my house is 92
feet

02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
feet
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
from that proposed tower this picture
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
showed a street
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
and a parking lot behind the street it
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
was completely
 
02:13:36.239 --> 02:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
was completely
false

02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
we went to review the file and we spoke
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
with public works director
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
it was then that we learned that tilson
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
tech had actually requested five permits
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
for five separate towers throughout the
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
city three of which were in residential
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
areas 30 seconds please um we spoke with
 
02:13:55.679 --> 02:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
areas 30 seconds please um we spoke with
them

02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the you know about our concerns
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
about the unknown health risks about the
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
decrease in our property value of a home
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we just purchased and he basically
 
02:14:09.189 --> 02:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
told us his hands were tied there was
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing that they can do and
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
my final paragraph
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
just to jump to it is that we fully
 
02:14:19.189 --> 02:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of good
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
cellular service a high quality cellular
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
network will undoubtedly benefit the
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
entire community but right now the way
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
things are
 
02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
things are
private

02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
for profit companies can come into a
 
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:33.990 align:start position:0%
for profit companies can come into a
city

02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
city
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
and decide who bears the cost of that
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
public benefit
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
they decide
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
where these towers go and the state
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to say anything about it and
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
the city doesn't get to say anything
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
about it and they put it where it's the
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
easiest and most convenient for them
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
they don't look at whether it's in the
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
middle of a neighborhood they don't
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
think about any of them thank you very
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony we really
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming down today
 
02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming down today
and

02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
i'll call on our next speaker
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
and because i know he has other things
 
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
to do i'd like to call on griffin
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
robarge of the state department of
 
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
welcome mr robarge
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
my name is griffin roberge from the new
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of energy
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
here to testify in house bill 1644. um
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'll make it brief um the department is
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
only mentioned on page three
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
line 30
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
where it requires the department of
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services in
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
consultation with the department of
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
energy to establish fees to ensure the
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
cost of establishing maintaining and
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
advertising the online registry
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
established in this bill
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
per the fiscal note
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
the department of energy indicates i
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
have to adopt or modify rules governing
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
attachments made to public utility-owned
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
polls and structures
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
i think i'd have to agree with the
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from the department of health
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
and human services in that the bill does
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
not explicitly
 
02:16:19.270 --> 02:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
um make any requirement for the
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
departments to undertake any rule making
 
02:16:22.870 --> 02:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
but if we did
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
the cost would largely be negligible
 
02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:26.950 align:start position:0%
the cost would largely be negligible
um

02:16:26.950 --> 02:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
just going a little further the
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
department of energy doesn't have any
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
expertise regarding the development or
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
cost or of implementing an online
 
02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
cost or of implementing an online
registry

02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
registry
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
i know most of the responsibility
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
appears to fall to the department of
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
health and human services but
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
if the department of health and human
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
services were to consult with us again
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
we just don't have that adequate
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
experience to offer
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
additionally if this bill were to go
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
forward the department doesn't have any
 
02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
funding to hire any expertise if needed
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
if we put together this registry or
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
helping to put together this registry
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
those are at least just some
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
technical concerns that the department
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing today i'm
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to take any questions
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
the committee might have
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr roberge let this be my
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
standing apology for mispronouncing your
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
name probably we'll do it again it's i
 
02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
do not care
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking the question
 
02:17:27.359 --> 02:17:28.870 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking the question
and

02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
i can only remember it
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm going to have to pass
 
02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:34.950 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm going to have to pass
okay

02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr roberge
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll thank you mr roberge
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you members of
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%

and miss graham y'all you'll have three
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
minutes but i'll remind you
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for scientific
 
02:17:59.519 --> 02:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for scientific
data

02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
and information
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
that relates to the substance of this
 
02:18:05.519 --> 02:18:06.549 align:start position:0%
that relates to the substance of this
bill

02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
and hearing a story about
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
your personal
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
property valued
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you issues is not appropriate so
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
please thank you good morning and thank
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
um i actually wanted to talk about how
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
5g is a quantum leap compared to the
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
other generations of radio frequency
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
5g involves the entire microwave
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
spectrum that is 3 000 frequencies
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
not the 5 to 10 frequencies from
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
previous generations
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
if one does the math 5g should be called
 
02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:43.629 align:start position:0%
if one does the math 5g should be called
297g

02:18:43.629 --> 02:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
297g
 
02:18:43.639 --> 02:18:45.429 align:start position:0%
297g
297g

02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
297g
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
5g is designed to saturate
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
our homes schools and workplaces with
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
microwave frequencies of every kind
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
with no respite and with weapons grade
 
02:18:57.359 --> 02:19:00.389 align:start position:0%
with no respite and with weapons grade
capabilities

02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
we've heard from testimony from the
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
cellular telecommunications internet
 
02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:06.870 align:start position:0%
cellular telecommunications internet
association

02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
everything wireless speaking about how
 
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
fcc supersedes other authorities
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
there is no amount of excuses for any
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
laws federal state or local that trump
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
the constitutional and natural laws that
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
state all men and women are free to make
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
decisions on how they should live in the
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
privacy of their homes
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
this is not only about accommodating
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
people who already are aware that these
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
frequencies are making them sick
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's about the fact
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
that these frequencies
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on all living
 
02:19:42.479 --> 02:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on all living
things

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
your inaction on this bill would make
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
you complicit in placing men women and
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
children in direct harm
 
02:19:55.349 --> 02:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
we do not need to provide proof of harm
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
although that does exist it is your
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to prove to us
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
that this technology is safe
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
to date to date that is not possible
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
this technology is not safe and it's not
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
safe at levels well below what the fcc
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
claims is safe
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
virtually all non-thermal levels of
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
radiation even the extremely low ones
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
solicit damage to all living things
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony appreciate
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
you being here apparently she does not
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
want to accept any questions so we will
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
move on
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.110 align:start position:0%
and i will
ask

02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
the next person
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
to come to the table that would be lisa
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
misdean i'll remind you you have three
 
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
misdean i'll remind you you have three
minutes

02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
and if you have written testimony which
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
i suspect you do please do not read it
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
we can read it later just summarize your
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm actually going to read this
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony for deb hobson who's not able
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
to join us today
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
my name is deb hopson and i have lived
 
02:21:15.750 --> 02:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
in stratham for over 35 years as someone
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
whose health is seriously affected by
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
wireless i am acutely aware of the
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
potential cost of technology
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
thankfully i become knowledgeable enough
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
to successfully make choices to provide
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
a safe place in my home
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
and on my property while still having
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
the technology we all use daily
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
however the vast majority of the public
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
remains unaware you cannot make choices
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
for how to minimize risk without
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge especially if you do not
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
realize that a risk may even exist
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
it is clear that most think if there was
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
risk then they would not allow it
 
02:21:49.349 --> 02:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
however there is no protecting health
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the environment in this industry
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
despite the assurances that there are
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
that is clear
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
some of the many effects of wireless
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
technology are insomnia headaches foggy
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
head or inability to think or focus
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
dizziness nausea skin issues severe dry
 
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
eyes and other pro eye problems
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
tinnitus heart arrhythmias difficulty
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
breathing which to some can be mistaken
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
for panic attack blood clotting issues
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
etc i had all of them i am sure many of
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know those who suffer with these
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
symptoms and some may be told they have
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
anxiety which may or may not actually be
 
02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
what is happening there may be more to
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
the issue with regard to the potential
 
02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
effects of wireless as in the case for
 
02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:31.590 align:start position:0%
effects of wireless as in the case for
me

02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
at one point i was very concerned that i
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
had some early onset dementia as i was
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
finding myself lost while driving in my
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
own hometown that was very frightening
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
thankfully i discovered what a major
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
factor in all of my issues rf radiation
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
which some refer to those of me like
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
electro hypersensitives or ehs
 
02:22:52.389 --> 02:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
we learned
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
all we could with my health dramatically
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
improved when we hardwired our home
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
we ensured all wireless was off by
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
measuring with a meter and the plant in
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
our kitchen grew at least 15 inches in
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
two months
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
if a plant's growth can be that
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
dramatically affected imagine what is
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
happening to children
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
and those most vulnerable
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
my health issues resolved as long as i
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
avoid all wireless in today's world that
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
can be very difficult and very isolating
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
i could no longer use any public
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
transportation and travel i have great
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
difficulty entering public buildings
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals medical offices schools
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
churches restaurants and other people's
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
homes however i can control the
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
environment in my home and yard where i
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
spend most of my time as long as no
 
02:23:41.429 --> 02:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
antenna or tower is built nearby
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
radiating into my property and
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
eliminating any choice or control in my
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
home environment
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that is critical
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was the first in the
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
nation to do its own independent
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
investigation on the health
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of today's
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
wireless radiation i am thankful that
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
our republican state rep engineering and
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
our democratic state senator medical
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
doctor joined forces to sponsor that
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
bill this is not a partisan issue nor
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
should it be they listened
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
clearly this will be one of the most
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
important issues of our time yet many
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
are completely unaware it even exists
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
except for the occasional news stories
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
on microwave attacks on u.s government
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
personnel the physical result is the
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
same for the rest of us even if it's
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
unintentional parents should not have to
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
face the anguish they inevitably
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
may feel years down the road when they
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
realize the harm they inadvertently put
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
their children in while thinking they
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
were keeping them safe because they did
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
not know
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity to pass this
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
bill and support new hampshire
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
commission's findings as it begins to
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
take its first steps in implementing the
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations for new hampshire
 
02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:52.389 align:start position:0%
recommendations for new hampshire
citizens

02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions for
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
since this was a
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
previously written testimony by someone
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
else i'll assume there'll be no
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
questions so thank you very much we
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here to read that
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
okay so next up
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
and this very likely will be our last
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
testifier today
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
will be rick fabrizio
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
representing the business and industry
 
02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
representing the business and industry
association

02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
and uh remember we have a limit of three
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you very much thank you
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
out of respect for your time in the fact
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
that many of our points have been made
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
today we'll respectfully submit our
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony in place of speaking
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
we are here
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
as the
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statewide chamber of
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
commerce and leading business advocate
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
in respectful opposition to hp 1644.
 
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question for you
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
in a town such as the one i live in
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
if this
 
02:26:07.030 --> 02:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
1640 foot or 500 meter tower limit went
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
into effect
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to install any
 
02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to install any
towers

02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
towers
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our town that
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impose on
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
one of those residential districts
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
the general public would accept
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
02:26:29.359 --> 02:26:30.309 align:start position:0%
the fact
that

02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
no 5g could come to my town because of
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
these red kind of restrictions
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
i know that beth cooley addressed that
 
02:26:40.550 --> 02:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
point with the ctia about new hampshire
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents speaking in
 
02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
favor of the need for expanded broadband
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
including 5g
 
02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be able to speak to the
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
general feeling of the public however um
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
i think that most information points to
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
the need for expanded
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
online access to meet the ever-growing
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
increase in data transfer via online
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you representative
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
callie pitts has a question
 
02:27:09.439 --> 02:27:10.630 align:start position:0%
callie pitts has a question
well

02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
the that expanded uh access because
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
we're all doing everything online now
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
except the legislature
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
could that be achieved with what we have
 
02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:25.270 align:start position:0%
could that be achieved with what we have
now

02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not a subject matter on that but
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at the rate of growth of
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%

02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think the case has to be made for

i think the case has to be made for
expanded

02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
broadband i know that the state has been
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
working diligently to expand broadband
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
and 5g is part of that broadband network
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
may i follow
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:27:59.830 --> 02:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i think we heard testimony that
 
02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
and i i want to clarify that that fiber
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
could accomplish the same thing
 
02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
that is the point that someone
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
previously made yes
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%

02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%

02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
end of our public hearing for today so
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%

this committee
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
this public hearing rather
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
we still have four people who want to
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
speak and those four people will be
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%

02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%

02:28:50.399 --> 02:28:51.429 align:start position:0%
the calendar to
discover

02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%

and do do so in a manner that's clear
 
02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
administrators so that they don't
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
accidentally think that we completed the
 
02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing here
 
02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:14.469 align:start position:0%
public hearing here
okay

02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative um you had a question
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
so if others show up in this extended
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearing will you allow that testimony as
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
well or just before
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
we will allow
 
02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh testimony for the length of that
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
resumed public hearing so i'm going to
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
schedule it for an hour
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we will allow testimony until we run
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to take a lunch
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
break now from 11 30 to 12 30. we will
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
resume at 12 30 with our next bill which
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
is house bill 10
 
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
is house bill 10
12.

02:29:53.990 --> 02:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
12.
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
before the committee meteor
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
members leave the building or leave the
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
room i need to inform everyone
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
that there has been a change
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
previously the
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
date for early bills was scheduled at
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
february 17th
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
that has been changed to february 10th
 
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.349 align:start position:0%
that has been changed to february 10th
so

02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:18.650 align:start position:0%
we will be exacting
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:19.750 align:start position:0%
we will be exacting
[Music]

02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
having executive sessions on our five
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
early bills of which this one is one
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh probably on
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
february 8th
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
because we only have this room on
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
mondays and tuesdays
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
we could possibly get the room on a on
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
the 9th or the 10th
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
the 10th at noon time would be the
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
the cut off
 
02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:45.030 align:start position:0%
the cut off
so

02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be reluctant to to schedule an exec
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
session on the 10th
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
even if it was in the morning because it
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
would bump up against that deadline
 
02:30:54.399 --> 02:30:55.670 align:start position:0%
would bump up against that deadline
to

02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be enough wiggle room
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
there to allow us to get our business
 
02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
done so it's very likely going to be
 
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
exec session for the five early bills
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
maybe at three o'clock on february 8th
 
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:08.790 align:start position:0%
maybe at three o'clock on february 8th
so

02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
put that in your calendar and make sure
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
that you understand
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
that this is going to happen so that
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
everybody can make arrangements to be
 
02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
here to vote on these five early bills
 
02:31:24.790 --> 02:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
so with that no it's not next monday
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
february 8th
 
02:31:26.399 --> 02:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
february 8th
but

02:31:27.110 --> 02:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's the next meeting
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
no february 8th is three weeks from now
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
we do have a meeting that day but monday
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't we have a another holiday coming
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
up on a monday so we're going to be
 
02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
really behind the eight ball a little
 
02:31:44.319 --> 02:31:46.309 align:start position:0%
really behind the eight ball a little
bit

02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
the next holiday is after february 8th
 
02:31:49.359 --> 02:31:51.030 align:start position:0%
the next holiday is after february 8th
so

02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have to get this done before that
 
02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:55.190 align:start position:0%
we have to get this done before that
yeah

02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:57.670 --> 02:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
my point is we can't meet two days
 
02:31:59.270 --> 02:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
if we only have the room on mondays or
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
tuesdays we had a holiday this monday
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
we could meet on february 7th yeah
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
we could meet on january 31st
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
but uh i don't have any plans to do that
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
right now i'm going to try to get all
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%

oh

02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%

03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
recommending that it go on the consent
 
03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
recommending that it go on the consent
calendar

03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
essentially restored the energy
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs that were in place
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
before the recent triennium energy plan
 
03:35:16.080 --> 03:35:16.870 align:start position:0%
before the recent triennium energy plan
was

03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh rejected by the puc
 
03:35:21.990 --> 03:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
but it restores them at the 2020 funding
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
levels and with the guard rails that
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
that hb 549 put in place for future
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
future years
 
03:35:30.399 --> 03:35:33.670 align:start position:0%
future years
so

03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
when that bill comes back to the house i
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
will recommend that this committee in
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
the full house concur
 
03:35:42.550 --> 03:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
with that bill with the senate amendment
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
so with those announcements we can now
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
turn to the
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%

for the clerk
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
briefly approximately thirty thousand
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
dollars in property damage occurred on
 
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
my constituent's property on
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
moultonborough neck on april 5th 2021
 
03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
when a subcontractor of the new
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire electrical co-op removed trees
 
03:37:53.429 --> 03:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
from this property without providing
 
03:37:55.269 --> 03:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate notice
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to provide
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
notice by registered mail under rsa
 
03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:01.590 align:start position:0%
notice by registered mail under rsa
231-145

03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
231-145
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
prior to non-emergent tree removal
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
utilities are not required to provide
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
the same notice and the intent of the
 
03:38:10.229 --> 03:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
spill is to require that utilities
 
03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
provide the same notice as towns
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the event the utility claims they
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
provided notice in my constituents
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
december 2020 utility bill which does
 
03:38:21.750 --> 03:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
violate existing language
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
and rsa 231-172
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
i believe both consumers and utilities
 
03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
are better off if notice is provided and
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
issues are resolved before trees are cut
 
03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
down so i ask that you recommend this
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
other representatives have informed me
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
of similar occurrences elsewhere in the
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
state and i hope some of them will come
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
before you to testify today
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%

letting me come before you today and uh
 
03:39:38.710 --> 03:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
as rip marsh said i'm here because uh my
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
trees and all my neighbors trees and
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
everything the utility companies came in
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
they cut them all down
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
these weren't even trees that were above
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
the power line they were all small
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
ornamental bushes and like christmas
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
trees in the front yard of our homes and
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
they just came in and clear-cut
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
everything down they said to maintain
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
the lines the funny part is they didn't
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
cut down anything that would fall on the
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
trees and i would ask that you would
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation so that it would
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
be consistent with what everybody else
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
has to do as far as cutting the trees
 
03:40:11.189 --> 03:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know the the towns and everything
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
have to give notice and
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:14.790 align:start position:0%
you know
just

03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:40:16.309 --> 03:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of property damage to
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
everybody in my neighborhood and you
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
know we were all kind of upset and
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
we all maintain our houses to impeccable
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know thing and
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
i guess that's thank you mr weka sir
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question for you did uh
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
the utility notify you by mail
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
ordinary mail in advance of this tree
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
cutting tree cutting operation
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
what they said is when i when i
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
approached them when they were out front
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
cutting down the trees is they said you
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
were notified by mail so i said i was
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
never notified by mail so i i went in
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
and i got my utility bill and what they
 
03:40:55.349 --> 03:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
did is
 
03:40:57.269 --> 03:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
behind the utility bill was like almost
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
like a pamphlet like sometimes you see
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
the pamphlets on how to save energy or
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
something or this there's a little
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
pamphlet on the back of one sheet page
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
like this and it just said uh
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
trees trees shouldn't be uh planted
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
underneath utility lines and then it
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
gave a list of uh trees and shrubs that
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
were approved to be planted within 11
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
feet of utility lines but it didn't say
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
anything about them cutting anything
 
03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:22.389 align:start position:0%
anything about them cutting anything
down

03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
it just said approved trees for under
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
power lines and stuff like that
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
like i said all of our trees on our
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
street were all
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
uh very well maintained and most of them
 
03:41:34.150 --> 03:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
were just like have pictures here just
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
they were just small ornamental trees
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
that were
 
03:41:40.830 --> 03:41:40.840 align:start position:0%

i had to intercede for one of my
 
03:43:33.030 --> 03:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
constituents over a tree
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
and we had success by contacting the
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
department um
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%

several uh
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
correspondence back and forth with uh
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
many of the people on the board
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
um also
 
03:43:58.080 --> 03:43:59.510 align:start position:0%
um also
uh

03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on this it was a chairman
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
or a executive chairman or something
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:44:04.960 --> 03:44:06.150 align:start position:0%
like that
um

03:44:06.150 --> 03:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
and they basically just all told me we
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
got the right to cut down anything 11
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
feet on either side of the thing unless
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's an approved tree i
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
i really got nowhere with them uh they
 
03:44:19.830 --> 03:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
their attitude just was and the
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
gentleman that was the arborist that was
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
actually on side of the thing
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
i don't like to use these words but he
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
was probably one of the most arrogant
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:32.800 --> 03:44:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
03:44:37.510 --> 03:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just for
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
clarification uh you may have said this
 
03:44:43.510 --> 03:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i may have not heard
 
03:44:43.520 --> 03:44:44.469 align:start position:0%
but i may have not heard
the

03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
trees and shrubs that were cut down were
 
03:44:51.510 --> 03:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
they within the utilities right of way
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh in actuality where the pole is on my
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
property in 2015
 
03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh if you remember the big ice storm
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we had up here
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh the couple of trees the pole used to
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
be across the street
 
03:45:08.710 --> 03:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
and trees fell during that ice storm and
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
they fell
 
03:45:12.150 --> 03:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
over the thing and when they moved the
 
03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
pole they moved it to the other side of
 
03:45:15.990 --> 03:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
the street where my house is
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and from for
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
since 2015 they kept sending me a thing
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
every year asking me to give them an
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
easement on my property because they
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
didn't even have an easement where the
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
pole was and i refused to give them the
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
easement for the thing
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i didn't tell them to take it down
 
03:45:34.150 --> 03:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
either you know but uh
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
their their basic thing was
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
we have a right to cut 11 feet
 
03:45:42.150 --> 03:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
where the power lines are over overhead
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
11 feet either side of them unless
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
anything unless it's an approved
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
planting that's on our list which
 
03:45:52.710 --> 03:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
consisted about three or four plants but
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
as you can see from these photos
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
everything from the flowers and
 
03:45:57.359 --> 03:45:58.710 align:start position:0%
everything from the flowers and
everything

03:45:58.710 --> 03:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:46:00.150 --> 03:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
got clear-cut
 
03:46:05.349 --> 03:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:46:07.199 --> 03:46:08.229 align:start position:0%
follow up
follow-up

03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thanks for the
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
and to the best of your knowledge
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
did the co-op
 
03:46:19.429 --> 03:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
give you any avenue for appeal prior you
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
know prior to the work
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
no what i what i ended up doing was
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
i spent over two hundred thousand
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
dollars of my own money
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i buried all of the utilities
 
03:46:30.880 --> 03:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
and i buried all of the utilities
underground

03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
underground
 
03:46:34.150 --> 03:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
and they said they would work with me on
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
that as far as
 
03:46:37.830 --> 03:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
the permitting and stuff like that which
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
they did but it was all at my cost
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay representative harrington is
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
03:46:50.070 --> 03:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes this would go to the sponsor of the
 
03:46:51.510 --> 03:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill it there's a couple
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
of things on here that i'm just it
 
03:46:56.469 --> 03:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be too clear certainly
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
not not much guidance
 
03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
the owner refuses to consent the
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
selectmen of that town
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
will then determine if it's necessary to
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
remove the uh
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
the cutting or retreat
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
and also determine what the damage was
 
03:47:19.590 --> 03:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
to the owner and then they can award
 
03:47:19.600 --> 03:47:21.110 align:start position:0%
to the owner and then they can award
them

03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
well let me just start with that
 
03:47:23.429 --> 03:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
question how do they do how are they
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
going to determine if the tree is
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
necessary to be brought down and
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
determine how much the damage was done
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
to the owner
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
can you give me the line place that
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking at sure i saw 17 and 18.
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay that that's existing language in
 
03:47:44.790 --> 03:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.830 --> 03:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
so that's always been that way right the
 
03:47:49.590 --> 03:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
the changes that this bill would make
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
are in bold italic which is the usual
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
custom that we do when we draft bills
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up mr chairman may i have a
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
copy of whoever people are looking at
 
03:48:00.870 --> 03:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
back there on the table
 
03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up representative harrington
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah in the next paragraph down d on
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
line 19 this is involved it says a
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
licensee who fails to abide by this
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph she'll be liable for no less
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
than two times the damage is incurred
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
and no more than 10 times the damage is
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
incurred so just assuming that somehow
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
the selectmen are able to determine the
 
03:48:18.479 --> 03:48:19.590 align:start position:0%
the selectmen are able to determine the
damage

03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
damage
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
what guidance do they have as to whether
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
they should be assessing 10 times the
 
03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
damage or two times the damage because
 
03:48:27.030 --> 03:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think that's a valid comment um
 
03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the point of the
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph d is that a law without teeth
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
tends to get ignored as existing law
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
that required notice to my constituent
 
03:48:42.150 --> 03:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
was ignored so if we have no penalty in
 
03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
the law then there's no reason to expect
 
03:48:48.870 --> 03:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts is
 
03:48:51.040 --> 03:48:54.790 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts is
recognized

03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
i seem to remember
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we have had this discussion before
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
about cutting trees on private property
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
we had a group meeting and it was
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
agreed between the stakeholders the
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
utilities that they would notify people
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
that the trees were to be cut
 
03:49:17.120 --> 03:49:18.309 align:start position:0%
that the trees were to be cut
or

03:49:18.309 --> 03:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:49:20.710 --> 03:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
were pending to be cut and that would be
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
a very clear notification that they were
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
and in my town they have to post the
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
trees that they're going to cut
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
they have to actually put a paper on the
 
03:49:36.150 --> 03:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
tree saying it's slated to be cut
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know about wolfeboro but
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement they do
 
03:49:45.030 --> 03:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
if you had discussed
 
03:49:48.319 --> 03:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
if you had discussed
with

03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:49:49.199 --> 03:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
with
the

03:49:51.030 --> 03:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:49:51.040 --> 03:49:53.830 align:start position:0%
the
utility

03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
utility
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
that there has been an agreement
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we expect the utilities to stand by
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
the agreement to
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
discuss with people
 
03:50:04.479 --> 03:50:05.349 align:start position:0%
discuss with people
that

03:50:05.349 --> 03:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
tree said to be cut on private property
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
that they have to be and that if
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
a mistake is made or somebody does
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
something without knowledge that there
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
would be recompense
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
and did you go to an arbitration um
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
what i what i tried to do was i i
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
as i said i had several phone calls with
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
the co-op board members and
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
everybody involved there then i went to
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
and i spoke and then forgive me but i
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't remember her name i went up and i
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
saw later it's public utilities and she
 
03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
said that utilities like eversource and
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
stuff like that they do have an
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
agreement to mock and probably notice
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
she said the co-op the new hampshire
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
electric co-op does not fall under any
 
03:51:00.150 --> 03:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
and that and she said so they don't have
 
03:51:02.479 --> 03:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
and that and she said so they don't have
to

03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
follow up so should i yes my follow-up
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be then should this bill be
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
that i guess would be a question for you
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
guys good sponsor
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable to me
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mick
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
williams is recognized for a question
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair bose
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up on this discussion
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're having about
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
penalties and also making sure that this
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
actually applies to the new hampshire
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
electric co-op
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the existing language
 
03:51:44.309 --> 03:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
here on line two roman numeral two a
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
licensee shall provide notice
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
so i i apologize that i haven't had an
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at the full rsa
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
but for rsa 231 172 when we're talking
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
about a licensee are we just talking
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
about these recognized large utilities
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
or does the new hampshire electric co-op
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually fall under the definition of
 
03:52:03.359 --> 03:52:06.550 align:start position:0%
actually fall under the definition of
licensee

03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.710 --> 03:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh i'm sorry i don't know the answer to
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
your question okay can i ask a follow-up
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
follow up okay
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so i think in order for us to
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually make sure that this works to do
 
03:52:19.750 --> 03:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
what you intend i think we need to
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
understand who a licensee is or tweak
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
this to actually achieve your goal
 
03:52:28.150 --> 03:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i also want to just point out that
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 21 where you're talking
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
about two times damages incurred and no
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
more than 10 times damage is incurred
 
03:52:35.750 --> 03:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty broad range if we're
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
talking about 30 000 worth of damage
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
right two times is sixty thousand but
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
ten times is three hundred thousand so
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know that that window just seems
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
extreme and we are not a court of law
 
03:52:49.349 --> 03:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
we're the legislature so who's applying
 
03:52:51.510 --> 03:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
the two to ten times who decides that
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
two to ten times is there some kind of
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
an adjudication adjudication process to
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
determine where you fall in the spectrum
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of damages i'm not seeing that
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
from the language in the bill so i want
 
03:53:03.830 --> 03:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
to know how that would work if we were
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
to use the exact language in the bill or
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
if it needs an amendment when you when
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
you look at when you are
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
sorry when you look at the law regarding
 
03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
tree cut in the state of new hampshire
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
there is laws on the books now and there
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
are cases i can't cite them off the top
 
03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
of my head i'm not a lawyer where when
 
03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
trees were cut on private property it
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
has been brought before the courts and
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
the court determined that depending on
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
damages and put that but there is
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
case law numerous case law in the state
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
regarding that
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
two times to ten times law and that's
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
assessed by the court as as the court
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
sees fit
 
03:53:42.630 --> 03:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
so it requires a lawsuit to get your two
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
to ten hundred it does require it does
 
03:53:46.870 --> 03:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
require the lawsuit to get to get to
 
03:53:50.070 --> 03:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mcwilliams
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
section 231
 
03:53:57.840 --> 03:53:58.630 align:start position:0%

of

03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:54:03.150 --> 03:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
191 sub chapters subsections
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
and it would take us a while to figure
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
out what licensee means but i i
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
i take your point i think it's a good
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
one we need to find that out before we
 
03:54:14.960 --> 03:54:15.670 align:start position:0%
one we need to find that out before we
can

03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
decide what uh how to proceed
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bernardi is
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
03:54:26.229 --> 03:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:54:26.239 --> 03:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
and

03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
and
so

03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
as i understand your bill
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're predominantly in addition to this
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
this issue of
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
penalties you're looking for a better
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
defined notice
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
but what i heard you talk about was
 
03:54:44.389 --> 03:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
damages to
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
small ornamental trees uh and and
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
flowers and and whatnot um
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
which reasonably shouldn't have been cut
 
03:54:57.910 --> 03:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not on the no cut list
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if if you can comment
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
on whether or not
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
that no cut list should be amended
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
to reflect that kind of vegetation
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the reason i ask that is because
 
03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:16.389 align:start position:0%
and the reason i ask that is because
the

03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.389 --> 03:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
utilities have gone through my town
 
03:55:20.150 --> 03:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
recently and
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
under all the major
 
03:55:24.790 --> 03:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
power lines they're going in and they're
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
just cutting everything down but if it's
 
03:55:28.080 --> 03:55:28.870 align:start position:0%
just cutting everything down but if it's
uh

03:55:28.870 --> 03:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
and they have big right-of-ways under
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
these big power lines but uh
 
03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:34.469 align:start position:0%
these big power lines but uh
under

03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:55:36.790 --> 03:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
local you know polls
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
that go through people's yards along the
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
roadside they're just trimming
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
the tall trees that might fall in
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're not cutting
 
03:55:47.670 --> 03:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
any of the vegetation on the ground this
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
seems very strange that it happened
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
there and maybe that needs to be
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
addressed as
 
03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
they well that was the funniest part
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
about it they didn't cut anything that
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
was all higher than the than that than
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
than the uh
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
the power lines everything they cut on
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
the whole road
 
03:56:11.910 --> 03:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:11.920 --> 03:56:13.110 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up and if it had the opportunity
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
to grow up and entangle in the power
 
03:56:20.630 --> 03:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
lines that would make sense if they were
 
03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
going to do it every five years and say
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
okay you know five years from now this
 
03:56:26.070 --> 03:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
thing's going to be in the power lines
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
let's get it now but if it's an
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
ornamental tree
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's only going to grow eight feet
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
those things should be exempt so i'm
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you maybe want to amend
 
03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
this or address this to focus in on
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
utilities not taking down that kind of
 
03:56:42.479 --> 03:56:44.309 align:start position:0%
utilities not taking down that kind of
vegetation

03:56:44.309 --> 03:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
vegetation
 
03:56:47.590 --> 03:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
well all all of my trees could have i
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
guess not all of them but a lot of them
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
could have a lot of more spruce trees
 
03:56:54.710 --> 03:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
could have grown up that high
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
if they were not maintained
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i can even understand the utility
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
companies coming in and cutting down
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
trees if they're not maintained but if
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's maintaining their property
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
and if you look at 231 you read on to it
 
03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
a neighbor has a right to cut your
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
branches if they're hanging over your
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
house and doing damage to your house
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
which is understandable you know and the
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
utility companies should have to use the
 
03:57:22.150 --> 03:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
same type of discretion if it's at the
 
03:57:23.590 --> 03:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
point where it's going to damage their
 
03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:24.710 align:start position:0%
point where it's going to damage their
lines

03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
understandable but if i'm maintaining my
 
03:57:29.590 --> 03:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
tree whether it's hanging over your roof
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm cutting it back so it doesn't
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
damage your property or i'm keeping it
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
below the power lines you know there
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a little bit of common
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative cambrils is
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairman just for clarification uh the
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
power lines in this particular case were
 
03:57:50.720 --> 03:57:51.510 align:start position:0%
power lines in this particular case were
they

03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:57:53.429 --> 03:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
distribution lines or were they the
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
bigger transmission lines uh they're
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
just regular uh
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
regular i guess you call transmission
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
lights it's a small uh lake front road
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's a dirt road
 
03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
distribution coming to a local residency
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.120 --> 03:58:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
the representative partial is recognized
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's following up on thank you chair
 
03:58:19.910 --> 03:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
following up on the question by
 
03:58:21.750 --> 03:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh by somebody else
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh do i understand correctly that they
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
did not have an easement for the
 
03:58:26.790 --> 03:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
placement of the poll they put there in
 
03:58:26.800 --> 03:58:28.229 align:start position:0%
placement of the poll they put there in
2015

03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
2015
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
correct and did you pursue any kind of
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
trespass suit against ibm's second
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
um did you pursue a trespass
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
suit against them no that's actually
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
when i called the police i told him that
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
there was they had didn't even have a
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
right for the poll to be there and i
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
asked him to stop them from cutting and
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
he said he said i'm not going to get
 
03:58:48.389 --> 03:58:48.399 align:start position:0%
involved in that he says take that up
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
with the courts and to be honest with
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
you i'm not the type of person that
 
03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
wants to spend my time in a courthouse i
 
03:58:58.630 --> 03:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
would rather page to fix it uh and like
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
i said this this is more just
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
that i think the co-op should have to
 
03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
follow the same consistent rules that
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
the towns and municipalities the bigger
 
03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
utility companies they should have to
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
follow the same rules i mean we should
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
all follow the same rules
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so i
 
03:59:18.150 --> 03:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh one quick question before i recognize
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
03:59:24.070 --> 03:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
i assume you are a member of the co-op
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
ah yes i guess so so you actually are
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
part owner of the of the co-op
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works right i i guess
 
03:59:34.150 --> 03:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know i get a bill in the mail
 
03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i pay it i don't know if that makes
 
03:59:38.229 --> 03:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
any difference to how they treat
 
03:59:38.239 --> 03:59:39.189 align:start position:0%
any difference to how they treat
uh

03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
their members but um the trees and so on
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth but it's
 
03:59:45.030 --> 03:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's worth having on record
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
i turned it off i'd like to clarify with
 
03:59:55.990 --> 03:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and with you sir
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to amending this
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
04:00:00.640 --> 04:00:02.229 align:start position:0%
to make it
conform

04:00:02.229 --> 04:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
conform
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
with making the co-op conform to what
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
the other utilities do which is they
 
04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
have to notify and they have to post and
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
they have to make sure you are notified
 
04:00:13.030 --> 04:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
in a clear
 
04:00:15.910 --> 04:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
in a clear manner
 
04:00:22.229 --> 04:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:24.150 --> 04:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
i was going to say you guys understand
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
the organization of utility companies a
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
whole lot better than i do all i know is
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
that i have an angry constituent who got
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
his trees cut down and he would like to
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
know this isn't going to happen again
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
right and and more than one actually i
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
talked to some of the neighbors we've
 
04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
done we've we've had this discussion and
 
04:00:42.150 --> 04:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
we had an agreement with the other
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
utilities so
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
we should bring this utility
 
04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
either with legislation or whether you
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
in agreement in front of the puc
 
04:00:53.189 --> 04:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
into conformance
 
04:00:56.550 --> 04:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
but we can we can do it by legislation
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions for these two
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
gentlemen seeing none
 
04:01:05.429 --> 04:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
i noticed that
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
ms gamache from eversource has signed up
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
to testify she may have some
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
information for us that will be
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
revealing but before we get to that
 
04:01:15.670 --> 04:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
testimony i want to call
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative kat mcgee who is a
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this legislation to
 
04:01:19.439 --> 04:01:20.870 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this legislation to
testify

04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
on its behalf
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman bose and esteemed
 
04:01:29.840 --> 04:01:31.189 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman bose and esteemed
colleagues

04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
i'll be quick
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
because i think most most of our points
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
have been covered
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
as the prime sponsor has made clear the
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
impetus for this bill comes from one
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
constituent mr weckesar right here
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
based on his financial
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
significant financial loss that he
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
contends was unnecessary for the removal
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
of 13 ornamental trees that he
 
04:01:50.560 --> 04:01:51.670 align:start position:0%
of 13 ornamental trees that he
maintained

04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
04:01:51.680 --> 04:01:53.110 align:start position:0%
maintained
regularly

04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
04:01:54.630 --> 04:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
and which he says were no
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
pose no threat to the utility lines
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
it comes down to a request for a more
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
clearly defined due process
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
as there is dispute both as to whether
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the affected constituent was given
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
proper notice and also whether there was
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
any opportunity to respond or dispute
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
the decision to impose thirty thousand
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of damage on a private
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
land owner
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um mr weckerser's letter contends he's
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
already doing more than the average
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
citizen to maintain both his own
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
property and state-owned property that
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
abuts his property
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
with consideration for safety and also
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
the health of the trees
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
so the bill asks for simple language
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
changes that clarify how the utilities
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
are to notify landowners who are
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled for tree removal and of course
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
we already discussed that it includes
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
penalties to try and give teeth to that
 
04:02:47.680 --> 04:02:49.189 align:start position:0%
penalties to try and give teeth to that
law

04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that the
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
231 and it's 191 subsections to just
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that the electric co-op is
 
04:03:01.680 --> 04:03:02.630 align:start position:0%
make sure that the electric co-op is
actually

04:03:02.630 --> 04:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh covered as a licensee under the
 
04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
language that is listed in this brief
 
04:03:06.800 --> 04:03:07.670 align:start position:0%
language that is listed in this brief
bill

04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
um makes sense and if that if it's not
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately covered that we come up
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to do that and i would
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
be happy to work on that and help make
 
04:03:15.750 --> 04:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
04:03:17.590 --> 04:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
um i was not aware that this kind of
 
04:03:19.510 --> 04:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
clear-cutting uh that surprised mr
 
04:03:21.510 --> 04:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
weckerser was even possible without
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
registered mail notification and that's
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
why i opted to sign on as a co-sponsor
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
04:03:28.150 --> 04:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
and now that it's been brought to our
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
attention i would ask my colleagues to
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
consider this a utilitarian fix to
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
statute that does not currently cover a
 
04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee any
 
04:03:42.150 --> 04:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative mickey now seeing none
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
we'll um
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again representative and move
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
on to our next speaker unbeknownst to me
 
04:03:52.150 --> 04:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
when i mention miss gamache a few
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
michael liccato who is a vice president
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
at new hampshire electric co-op happens
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:04:01.670 --> 04:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
in attendance and i'm sure he
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
will have much illuminating information
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
on this question so i'm going to call to
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
the stand now michael lacada of new
 
04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
yeah mr uh wickester you might want to
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman members of the
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record michael
 
04:04:31.269 --> 04:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
akata with new hampshire electric co-op
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
i apologize that was a minute or two
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
late so i couldn't hear the full extent
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor and the constituents
 
04:04:38.479 --> 04:04:39.830 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor and the constituents
testimony

04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak to this specific
 
04:04:42.000 --> 04:04:43.670 align:start position:0%
so i can't speak to this specific
constituent's

04:04:43.670 --> 04:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
constituent's
 
04:04:43.680 --> 04:04:45.349 align:start position:0%
constituent's
situation

04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:04:47.189 --> 04:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
but i can speak to new hampshire
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
electric co-ops practices and policies
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
and the statutes that we're required to
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
conform to
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of tree trimming and
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
notification to constituents so
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
to answer representative kelly pitts's
 
04:05:00.479 --> 04:05:01.750 align:start position:0%
to answer representative kelly pitts's
question

04:05:01.750 --> 04:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
just right off the bat
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
this statute does apply to new hampshire
 
04:05:08.070 --> 04:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
electric co-op we are a
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
regulated distribution utility in the
 
04:05:11.670 --> 04:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
a little confusion sometimes for folks
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
we are not rate regulated uh because we
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
are a non-profit member owned
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
cooperative so
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
when we set our electric distribution
 
04:05:24.309 --> 04:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
rates those do not have to be approved
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
by the public utilities commission
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
they're approved by our board of
 
04:05:26.960 --> 04:05:28.070 align:start position:0%
they're approved by our board of
directors

04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
directors
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
but we do have to comply with the
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
statutes and
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire so
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of the requirement for a 45-day
 
04:05:36.319 --> 04:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
in terms of the requirement for a 45-day
notification

04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
notification
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
before vegetation management or tree
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
trimming that is something that we have
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
to do and that we do comply with
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
we send out
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
notices via mail to our members to their
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
the mailing address that we have on file
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
monthly utility bills
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
if we it is a non-member property owner
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
we utilize the municipal tax records for
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
the mailing address and that is where we
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
would send the notification i would note
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we have a large number of seasonal
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
members second homes
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so it is possible that uh
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
folks are either in between their two
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
locations and it is possible that they
 
04:06:24.150 --> 04:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
do not get the the mail notification but
 
04:06:26.469 --> 04:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
we we make every effort to send the
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
notification to their mailing address on
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
file we actually exceed uh the statutory
 
04:06:32.080 --> 04:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
file we actually exceed uh the statutory
requirement

04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh we send a
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
phone call two to three weeks before we
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
go on to
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
an area for trimming
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
to have further notification again this
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
is provided
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
via the phone number that we have as a
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
contact information for the member on
 
04:06:49.920 --> 04:06:51.269 align:start position:0%
contact information for the member on
file

04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
file
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
i would say again i can't speak for um
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
the gentleman's experience i would be
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
happy to talk to him afterwards it
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like he's made several inquiries
 
04:07:02.790 --> 04:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
to the co-op on this
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh subject
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
but we do
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
quite frankly make every effort to work
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
with our members i think as all
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
utilities do with their customers and
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're informed on the
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
extent of the cutting to understand
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
why we're cutting and uh you know the
 
04:07:22.479 --> 04:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
why we're cutting and uh you know the
the

04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
reasons for that and quite frankly
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
there are situations where if we
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
go outside the right-of-way if we cut a
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
tree that we're not supposed to we do
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
try to work with those individuals and
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
try to repair property damage if it
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
occurs that could be
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
reseeding a lawn that could be planting
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
ornamental trees
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
and so i would be happy to
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
learn more about what happened in this
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
particular situation and talk to the
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
folks back at the co-op so we are
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
concerned with the legislation as
 
04:07:56.560 --> 04:07:58.149 align:start position:0%
concerned with the legislation as
drafted

04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
we are compliant as i said we actually
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
go a bit above and beyond in terms of
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
our notifications uh then we're required
 
04:08:05.840 --> 04:08:07.030 align:start position:0%
our notifications uh then we're required
to

04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree with uh or
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
we have a number of the same questions
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
that committee members raised on the
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
penalties that are
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
listed in the legislation uh who
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
determines the extent of the damage and
 
04:08:23.110 --> 04:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
the cost associated uh is that the
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
utility is it the property owner is it a
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
third party is it a court is it a
 
04:08:27.359 --> 04:08:28.710 align:start position:0%
third party is it a court is it a
selectmen

04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
and then how those are applied
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was noted uh the two to ten times
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
damage how was that determination made
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
again is that um
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately a legal decision and i would
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
just add uh at the end of the day as a
 
04:08:44.399 --> 04:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
just add uh at the end of the day as a
non-profit

04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
member-owned utility
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately any additional costs that we
 
04:08:49.520 --> 04:08:50.229 align:start position:0%
ultimately any additional costs that we
are

04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh that we assume for certified mail for
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know sort of punitive damages
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
required ultimately is recovered by all
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
of our members through our rates we
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't have profits we don't have
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
shareholders uh really our our electric
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
members as
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
the chairman pointed out who are our
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
member owners um
 
04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the cost so
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to answer any questions
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
that i
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
am able to
 
04:09:17.840 --> 04:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
am able to
and

04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
i will be providing written testimony uh
 
04:09:21.359 --> 04:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
i will be providing written testimony uh
electronically

04:09:23.110 --> 04:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
04:09:25.110 --> 04:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr lakota it's great to see
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
you again i have a couple of quick
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
questions for you by any chance you know
 
04:09:31.149 --> 04:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
what the definition of licensee in
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
rsa231 colon 172 is
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't have it at the fingertips but
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
i would assume
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
it applies to the distribution utilities
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
who do the cutting
 
04:09:44.710 --> 04:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
are responsible for the cutting
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
my second question is a little more
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
detailed i serve on the planning board
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
in my town of epping
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
and when
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
eversource or new hampshire electric
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
co-op both of whom serve my town
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
want to do tree cutting in our town they
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
hire subcontractors
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
and those subcontractors are required to
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
come before the planning board to tell
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
the planning board
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
where they're going to cut
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
what hours they're going to use for you
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
know to do their cutting
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and who
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
a property owner could contact if they
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
about what the subcontractor was doing
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the area where mr wickster lives do
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
you use subcontractors and are they
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
subject to the same kind of planning
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
board scrutiny that they are in my town
 
04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh we do use subcontractors to do the
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
actual trimming um we have arborists uh
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
on staff who oversee the
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
that in terms of um
 
04:10:50.710 --> 04:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
the municipality interaction um
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll have to double check uh but
 
04:10:54.870 --> 04:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
certainly we would essentially treat all
 
04:10:56.630 --> 04:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
the municipalities the same and follow
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
the statutes so
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to say yes but i would
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
want to check with our team
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
question mr lecotte your representation
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
of what you do
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
appears to be different than the
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard from the
 
04:11:19.590 --> 04:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
party who was affected so i it asks you
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
to go through your records
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
and check out what did happen
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
and meet with the landowner and see what
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
you can work out i'd be happy to thank
 
04:11:28.319 --> 04:11:31.429 align:start position:0%
you can work out i'd be happy to thank
you

04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for taking my
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
question uh just for clarification i i
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's been at least established
 
04:11:40.389 --> 04:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
by the cons by the previous speaker
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
that the poll in question was
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
not given a right of way and was i guess
 
04:11:48.550 --> 04:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
still on his private property
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know because i don't
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
do you happen to know if any of the
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
statutes address
 
04:11:57.030 --> 04:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
the cutting of trees
 
04:11:57.040 --> 04:11:58.870 align:start position:0%
the cutting of trees
when

04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:11:58.880 --> 04:11:59.830 align:start position:0%
when
the

04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
property in question has not been given
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
a right of way in its private property
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
do they have to get written permission
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
so to speak before they can go on there
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
and do any cutting yeah i i
 
04:12:13.110 --> 04:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer i would assume
 
04:12:15.910 --> 04:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
that all of the applicable statutes uh
 
04:12:19.110 --> 04:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be in effect uh again i i don't
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
know the specific circumstance in terms
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
of an easement or a lack of an easement
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
work with the gentleman and learn more
 
04:12:30.950 --> 04:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
about the situation and see what
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh so
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
um yes please do because
 
04:12:41.110 --> 04:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
it almost looks like we're looking like
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
at a situation here where if you have a
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
a piece of utility property that hasn't
 
04:12:48.389 --> 04:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
been given appropriate right of way
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
might be in conflict perhaps for the
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
statute so it would be very good of you
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
to find that out please
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:03.279 --> 04:13:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
the witness in this case said
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
the name of the contractor ashfonder i
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
think and that's the one everybody uses
 
04:13:14.720 --> 04:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
think and that's the one everybody uses
i

04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
now you got to turn it on
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
i wonder
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
if the notice that the was mentioned on
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
the back of the bill
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be tree cutting
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the area
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
was that the notice that was mailed or
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
is there an individual letter and if
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
i would
 
04:13:56.239 --> 04:13:57.269 align:start position:0%
i would
assume

04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
assume
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
again you're doing assuming so i'm going
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
to assume that there is a copy of that
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
letter someplace
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i would like to know that before we
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
have to vote on a bill i think this can
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
be worked out amicably i don't know if
 
04:14:11.110 --> 04:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
you do
 
04:14:11.120 --> 04:14:12.149 align:start position:0%
you do
but

04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to know that all the things
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to happen or that you
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
say happened
 
04:14:18.239 --> 04:14:19.990 align:start position:0%
say happened
happen

04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
understood so to answer the first
 
04:14:24.309 --> 04:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
question the requirement under statute
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
is we can't just put a notification on
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
the back of a bill it has to be an
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
individual letter that is mailed uh and
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
i will
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
get the gentleman's contact information
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
follow up my follow-up is that
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
when an owner
 
04:14:44.880 --> 04:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
when an owner
confronts

04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
confronts
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
a worker and supposedly a representative
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
of the company who is the company
 
04:14:52.399 --> 04:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
of the company who is the company
arborist

04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
arborist
 
04:14:56.710 --> 04:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
and says cease and desist
 
04:14:56.720 --> 04:14:57.510 align:start position:0%
and says cease and desist
that

04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
that particular person
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
or that particular company doesn't make
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
a phone call
 
04:15:04.000 --> 04:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
a phone call
or

04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
that to me
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to be handled at
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
the company too it wasn't that this was
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
a remote thing it was a personal
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
cease and desist stop
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
and on his own property so i would like
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
also i would like you to investigate
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
i know they're hot people are hired to
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
do a job
 
04:15:33.840 --> 04:15:35.830 align:start position:0%
do a job
however

04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
they should have at least notified
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
somebody in authority above and beyond
 
04:15:43.349 --> 04:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
the arborist and i would assume that
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
there are people in the company who
 
04:15:51.189 --> 04:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
would act in that capacity so can you
 
04:15:53.110 --> 04:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
see if there was any notification of
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
that incident prior
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
remember we're here to ask questions i
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
would like to know that okay yeah
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
as i said i i'm not familiar with the
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
situation uh with this individual
 
04:16:04.640 --> 04:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
situation uh with this individual
constituent

04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with him to learn
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
more and also have a conversation with
 
04:16:11.680 --> 04:16:13.030 align:start position:0%

okay representative jd bernardi is
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%

party has been notified that there will
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
be tree cutting trimming
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
in their area
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
those individuals to to
 
04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
have a discussion with
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
whoever is going to do the job not to
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
cut down ornamentals and flower beds and
 
04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
other such
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
vegetation or do they just show up and
 
04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
do it no yes we do um you know again i
 
04:16:57.429 --> 04:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the situation um that
 
04:16:57.439 --> 04:16:58.469 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the situation um that
occurred

04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
04:16:58.479 --> 04:16:59.349 align:start position:0%
occurred
but

04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:17:01.269 --> 04:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
that is our goal is to have a
 
04:17:04.229 --> 04:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
conversation we have had
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
instances where i have spoken to const
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
to members where our team has spoken to
 
04:17:11.110 --> 04:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
members and they have marked certain
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
trees they've marked certain sensitive
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
areas that they don't want um
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
impacted so
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
that is our goal if
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know what happened in this
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
situation but that is is our goal and
 
04:17:26.550 --> 04:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
what we strive to do
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative harrington is
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:17:35.110 --> 04:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
question i just want to make this clear
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
because it seems to be this seems like a
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
new part we're kind of opening up and
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
whether we need more adjustments to the
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
law does your company have a policy that
 
04:17:43.680 --> 04:17:45.110 align:start position:0%
law does your company have a policy that
addresses

04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
i come out of my house you've sent
 
04:17:49.269 --> 04:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
someone over to cut down trees and i say
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
get off my land
 
04:17:52.870 --> 04:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
what is the what is your policy on how
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
circle back on that to give you an
 
04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
accurate answer i don't want to tell you
 
04:18:03.750 --> 04:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
just want to say that that's that to me
 
04:18:08.630 --> 04:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
is the heart of the issue right here
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
because if there's no policy and effect
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
at that i think we need to make an
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill thank you
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for mr lakota
 
04:18:22.309 --> 04:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here today looks
 
04:18:24.550 --> 04:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
like you've got some homework to do and
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm sure you'll get back to us
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
with with detailed answers
 
04:18:30.070 --> 04:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
we have two more people who would like
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
to testify and i'd like to call on donna
 
04:18:34.870 --> 04:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
gamache from eversource and then jason
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
stock of the timberland owners
 
04:18:38.950 --> 04:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
association ms gamache the floor is
 
04:18:38.960 --> 04:18:40.229 align:start position:0%
association ms gamache the floor is
yours

04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
yours
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you very much for
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify i'm glad that
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
mike went before me
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i don't have to speak to some of the
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
things that he already spoke to
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
eversource is concerned about the bill
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
should it pass as is
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
we think that it will
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
be uh costly it'll slow down our tree
 
04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
trimming process and there's a lot of
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
loose ends you you all heard it already
 
04:19:05.110 --> 04:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
and you know mainly the big concern for
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
us also is you know who determines the
 
04:19:09.750 --> 04:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
extent of the damage and then how do you
 
04:19:12.309 --> 04:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
apply you know the penalty so that one
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
we had a big question about but i
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
thought what i would do
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
is just very quickly let you know why we
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
even have how these rules have evolved
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
over time
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
eversource before we were ever sourced
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
we were public service of new hampshire
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
and like in the late 80s early 90s we
 
04:19:29.590 --> 04:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
were having some great financial
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty and in working with the
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission at the time
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
they were very intent on trying to not
 
04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
escalate the costs our rates for
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
customers as quickly as they were they
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
were rapidly increasing so the puc
 
04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
determined that we they would we would
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
slow down on our tree trimming programs
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
for quite a number of years it turned
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
out by doing that yes we did keep costs
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
down but our customers were severely
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
unhappy because we had outages we had
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
outages short term long term
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
and so they slowly determined that we
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
had to start spending money on dreaming
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
again to try to get this under control
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine for our customers
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's probably two things that matter
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
most to them how much they're paying on
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
their bill and do they have an outage in
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
how long do they have an outage
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
in fact the public utilities commission
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
they on a regular basis monitor
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
the duration of an outage the duration
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
between outages and how we do in in in
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
responding them to them and getting
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
everything restored where in fact uh
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
they they um i'm trying to think of the
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
word they um they grade us on that and
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
that impacts how we even our rate
 
04:20:42.870 --> 04:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
recovery so they use they when we sit
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
down and ask for a you know a rate case
 
04:20:47.189 --> 04:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
we go through all of that in fact after
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
every storm
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have to do a report and they
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
investigate how we did it and what
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
potentially could we have done
 
04:20:55.670 --> 04:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
differently in advance of the storm to
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that that was less of an
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
outage so um many of you remember the
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
ice storm of 2008
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
that one was mainly it was obviously
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
caused by ice but mainly it was the ice
 
04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
on the trees
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
and the trees took down so many lines
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
that it was it was unusual to have for
 
04:21:18.389 --> 04:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
the most part for a 14 day outage
 
04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
our customers and legislators were very
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
very unhappy at that time so
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
and this may be what you're talking
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
about um representative kelly pitts but
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
we may have done it more than once but
 
04:21:31.110 --> 04:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
right after that ice storm a group of
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislators pulled all the utilities in
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
and said we have to find a balance how
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
is it that you're notifying your
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
customers about your tree trimming
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
what can we do to make it easier so at
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
we had to get permission from our
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
customers to trim the trees and that
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't working because we couldn't term
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
a tree if we didn't get the permission
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
so the legislature determined at that
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
time that we would flip it
 
04:21:57.590 --> 04:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and so a law was passed that allowed us
 
04:21:59.990 --> 04:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
to notify customers that we were going
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
to trim and give them 45 days to let us
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
know if they did not want us to trim and
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
then we would go out and talk to them
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
and figure out is there something we can
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
do how can we how can we trim the tree
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
and still make you happy and if we can't
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
we'll put it aside and deal with it
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
later so for eversource we have a little
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
over a half a million customers for us
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
to have to notify our customers by
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
registered mail would be
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
highly expensive not only that not on
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
tree trimming because we don't do it but
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
in other instances when we determine
 
04:22:33.990 --> 04:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we have to reach out to a customer
 
04:22:36.070 --> 04:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
by registered mail i'm not going to say
 
04:22:37.830 --> 04:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
every customer does that but we have
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
customers who will not answer the door
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
and sign for that
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
so it that becomes a problem also so
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
what we will do in certain instances
 
04:22:49.110 --> 04:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
where we know it's super sensitive we're
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
not hearing back we'll put door hangers
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that the customer will see the door
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
hanger and they and then they have the
 
04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
information about who to contact and we
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
try to
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
resolve the situation there's always
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to be times when it didn't go well
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
accidents happen but i would say
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we've got a really
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
good process going and we'd like to be
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
able to keep the balance that we
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
currently have i do want to just mention
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
you probably know this many of you
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
probably already know this but there is
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
a difference in the way we trim
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
and what the requirements are for
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
distribution and transmission
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
after the blackout of 2003 which did not
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
affect new hampshire thank god we were
 
04:23:30.070 --> 04:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
able to shut off the spigot and protect
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves but you know that it started
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
in ohio it went all across eastern
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
united states the federal government
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
determined the federal government
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
regulates transmission so the federal
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
government determined at that point
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
that it was a tree that started that
 
04:23:48.790 --> 04:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
outage and so they were going to
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
institute completely new policies and
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
penalties associated with tree trimming
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
on um transmission lines i see it it's
 
04:23:59.110 --> 04:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
happening in my town where i live now
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
i call it sad to say the scorched earth
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
policy that
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
nothing grows they come through and
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
nothing grows under those transmission
 
04:24:09.269 --> 04:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
lines and that's a requirement of the
 
04:24:11.429 --> 04:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
federal government and if utilities do
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
not comply
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
they get a million dollar i think it's a
 
04:24:17.429 --> 04:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
day a million dollar a day fine
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
for not ensuring that that trimming is
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
done appropriately so in closing if you
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
do decide to move forward with a bill if
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
we could talk about finding a balance
 
04:24:27.910 --> 04:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific thank you very
 
04:24:27.920 --> 04:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific thank you very
much

04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:32.389 --> 04:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
ms gamache for that testimony as an
 
04:24:32.399 --> 04:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
ms gamache for that testimony as an
aside

04:24:35.110 --> 04:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
recall previous years in this committee
 
04:24:39.670 --> 04:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
we always imposed fines for people who
 
04:24:41.110 --> 04:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
forgot to turn off their cell phones
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.640 --> 04:24:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

04:24:45.750 --> 04:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative kreshan is recognized for
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thanks for taking my
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
question um it's just in regard to the
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
the door hangers that you mentioned in
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
cases where it seems sort of sensitive
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
can you just tell me a little bit more
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
about how you make that determination of
 
04:25:02.550 --> 04:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
when further outreach is required
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
i wish i could i'm very sorry i don't
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
know how we know
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that our crews we
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
obviously work with contractors we use
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
asplin sometimes we use brown as well
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
we regularly go through cycles
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they tend to know
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it's it we find out later
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
that it's sensitive i do want to just
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
state it may be helpful
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
i have been talking with the uh chairman
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee to bring in our
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
arborist uh we're expanding our arborist
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
team and
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to come up with a day that
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
works for everybody that he might be
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
able to walk you through exactly how we
 
04:25:42.229 --> 04:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
do what we do and answer your questions
 
04:25:45.110 --> 04:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
i will say he's fascinating he's created
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
an arboretum
 
04:25:46.720 --> 04:25:47.510 align:start position:0%
an arboretum
that

04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
that what he's intending to do is
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
educate communities and then long-term
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
um individuals about the types of growth
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
that work with uh distribution and
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
transmission license representative came
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
in and visited our arboretum so uh
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
anyway for the f he might be able to
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
answer that question in the meantime if
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
you'd like i can get try to get an
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
answer for that thank you so much you're
 
04:26:07.199 --> 04:26:08.710 align:start position:0%
answer for that thank you so much you're
welcome

04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:26:11.830 --> 04:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we uh need to move on
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas is recognized
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thanks for taking my
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
question really quick
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
to the best of your knowledge on the
 
04:26:19.439 --> 04:26:20.950 align:start position:0%
to the best of your knowledge on the
statutes

04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
do they make a distinction whether or
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
not they apply to
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
your rights of ways or
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.760 --> 04:26:34.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
i know that in terms of rights of ways
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
the different rights of ways there's
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
certain clearing levels that we're
 
04:26:42.149 --> 04:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to meet there must be inter
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
like if you think about like the city of
 
04:26:45.269 --> 04:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
manchester we have polls going down
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
streets there are trees they must have a
 
04:26:49.349 --> 04:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
different set of requirements as well i
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that they that they would
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
apply the same because it's a different
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
type of trimming
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you ms gamache jason stock you
 
04:26:58.960 --> 04:27:00.469 align:start position:0%
thank you ms gamache jason stock you
have

04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
the grand total of six minutes
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
including questions
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
but i know you can handle it thank you
 
04:27:10.149 --> 04:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the for the record i'm jason stock
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive director
 
04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me new hampshire timberland
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
owners association and
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to share with you some
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
information about timber values and this
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
bill caught our attention because we
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
deal in the world of doomage that's the
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
term used to
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
value standing timber timber
 
04:27:34.229 --> 04:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
and so we saw this bill
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
and one of our policy committee members
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
is a forester and also an arborist and
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
doomage three in this case two to ten
 
04:27:45.600 --> 04:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
doomage three in this case two to ten
times

04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
has been applied to ornamental trees um
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
on what's called a timber trespass so to
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
answer representative thomas's question
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
when you have a piece of land and it's
 
04:27:59.110 --> 04:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
you own the land fee simple and someone
 
04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
comes over and cuts your trees that's
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
considered a timber trespass
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and the law entitles you to dumage
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
which is ten to ten three in in terms of
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
the timber harvesting laws
 
04:28:14.469 --> 04:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
three to ten times the value of that
 
04:28:16.710 --> 04:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
stumpage and that's the
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
and those values are derived from the
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
department of revenue who calculates
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
stumpage which is then used to calculate
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
your timber tax
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
um we got involved in this issue a
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
number of years ago because what we were
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
seeing out there was
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
doomage being applied to ornamental
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
trees and this arborist mem committee
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
member of ours
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
was seen situations where someone cut a
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
tree say a maple tree about
 
04:28:43.670 --> 04:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
eight to ten inches thick
 
04:28:43.680 --> 04:28:44.550 align:start position:0%
eight to ten inches thick
and

04:28:44.550 --> 04:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
they cut it
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
damages are applied and what they did
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
was to calculate the damages the
 
04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
attorney came in
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
went down to the nursery and found out
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
what the value of a maple sapling is
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
extrapolate extrapolated that out to the
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
value of an eight to ten inch tree and
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
then added ten times and in a couple
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
instances the value of a couple trees
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
was worth more than probably the entire
 
04:29:11.520 --> 04:29:12.630 align:start position:0%
was worth more than probably the entire
parcel

04:29:12.630 --> 04:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
parcel
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
um so again we don't i just wanted to
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of i wasn't really planning to
 
04:29:19.030 --> 04:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
testify today but i heard a lot of
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
questions about timber values and how do
 
04:29:23.990 --> 04:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
you how do you determine what is in this
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
case they're using a two to ten times
 
04:29:27.269 --> 04:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
the value
 
04:29:28.630 --> 04:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know that's usually part of a
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
negotiation between parties that are
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
trying to determine that are typically
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
negotiating a timber trespass
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
applying that to an ornamental tree is
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
is really inappropriate
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
to apply that
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
right now what typically happens is i
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
understand it from our my committee
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
member who gets involved in these
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
disputes is that
 
04:29:50.399 --> 04:29:51.389 align:start position:0%
disputes is that
rsa

04:29:51.389 --> 04:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
634 which is the criminal
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
criminal uh criminal mischief
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
destruction of property law that's what
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
really typically kicks in when you have
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
an ornamental tree or property damage
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
not the timber harvesting laws which
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
apply doomage
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
so again i i wanted to provide you some
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
information i'm feeling compelled to
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
check a box on the
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
on the on the card i did check that we
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill just for the mere fact
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
that we think we're not opposed yet
 
04:30:23.110 --> 04:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
we're ambivalent on the
 
04:30:25.110 --> 04:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
notice provision but we do think that
 
04:30:25.120 --> 04:30:26.229 align:start position:0%
notice provision but we do think that
applying

04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
applying
 
04:30:28.950 --> 04:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
a a doomage type factor to an ornamental
 
04:30:31.030 --> 04:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
tree is is really not appropriate and
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
with that i'll conclude my testimony
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%

but with that
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
testimony we'll close the public hearing

04:31:31.520 --> 04:31:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
we'll take a
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
two-minute break
 
04:31:38.710 --> 04:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
so people can
 
04:31:41.110 --> 04:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
have a bio break and then we'll start
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to now open the public
 
04:36:17.551 --> 04:36:17.561 align:start position:0%

04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
is rebecca mcwilliams i represent the
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
west side of concord
 
04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm here today because i've
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
run across an issue that seems to be
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
an emerging concern
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
for small businesses and possibly large
 
04:36:52.869 --> 04:36:52.879 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state of new
 
04:36:52.879 --> 04:36:54.070 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state of new
hampshire

04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:36:55.750 --> 04:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
so just a little bit of background as to
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
why this bill and why now um
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
as you may know
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
my family owns and runs a family farm
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
here in concord
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we recently had a ground mount solar
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
system installed
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
the system is hooked up to our farm's
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
barn meter
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
which is the electric meter for the farm
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
stand and the barn
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
we also have an electric meter that's
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
for the house which controls the well
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
pump that's usually our most expensive
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
electric thing is the well pump for the
 
04:37:29.279 --> 04:37:30.709 align:start position:0%
electric thing is the well pump for the
fields

04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
fields
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
as well as obviously we have some
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
lighting that gets very expensive around
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
now january and february when we're
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
growing seedlings inside
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
so like
 
04:37:41.750 --> 04:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much every single farm in new
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have more than one electric
 
04:37:45.119 --> 04:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have more than one electric
meter

04:37:46.150 --> 04:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
meter
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so the reason that's important is
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
because when a farm does something like
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
installing solar panels
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
they have to decide which meter to
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
install the panels to connect to and in
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
our case we've been successful in
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
accumulating some credits spinning that
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
meter backwards
 
04:38:03.990 --> 04:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
but there is another meter associated
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
with that business and so we would like
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to transfer that excess
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
credits for the solar panels to the barn
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
and farm stand
 
04:38:12.869 --> 04:38:12.879 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
because that's where the well pump is
 
04:38:18.869 --> 04:38:18.879 align:start position:0%
and so we knew going in that unitil
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
who is our utility will only allow us to
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
transfer credits once a year that's just
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
their policy
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it varies by um utility i know
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
eversource has a different policy than
 
04:38:31.750 --> 04:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
unitil and i don't actually know what
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
the electric co-ops policy is but having
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
these different policies makes it
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
difficult for businesses across the
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
state to make decisions about how
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to handle their
 
04:38:43.029 --> 04:38:43.039 align:start position:0%
electricity and if they become a
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
consumer generator what they're going to
 
04:38:46.949 --> 04:38:46.959 align:start position:0%
do with those excess credits
 
04:38:46.959 --> 04:38:47.990 align:start position:0%
do with those excess credits
so

04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
think of this bill as somewhat of a
 
04:38:51.910 --> 04:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
rough draft to begin the conversation
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
about how we can better address this
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
because i do think we have quite a few
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
businesses who would benefit when they
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
have multiple meters
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
having the ability to once a month make
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
the decision to apply that credit to a
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
different account that's associated with
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
their business
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
so it's really i'm just going to read it
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
because it is such a short bill
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
literally what we're doing is inserting
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
a new paragraph in the net energy
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
metering surplus credit
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 362 a9 we're adding a new paragraph
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
it says notwithstanding other provisions
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
of this section a customer generator
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
with more than one account
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
may elect monthly to have any surplus
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
associated with one account credited to
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer generator's other account
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
or accounts
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
so really we're talking about being able
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
to slide that money over to your other
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
account now there are a lot of things
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
that this does not say and i've received
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of feedback since i
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
submitted this to
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
ols a couple months ago
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
so there are some things to talk about
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
the first is i don't mention your
 
04:39:56.798 --> 04:39:57.910 align:start position:0%
the first is i don't mention your
utility

04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
utility
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense to amend this to
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
say something about it needs to be under
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
the same utility
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
so obviously if you have a farm that has
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
a property that is split down the middle
 
04:40:08.788 --> 04:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
and half is eversource and half as
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
unitil you wouldn't be able to transfer
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
between the two utilities so i think
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
amending this to say it's under one
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
utility makes sense
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:22.868 --> 04:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
another one is there's the potential for
 
04:40:24.550 --> 04:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
a really large business and i'm not
 
04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to call out any of their names but
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
there are some very large businesses who
 
04:40:30.310 --> 04:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
are large landowners
 
04:40:32.708 --> 04:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
who may be able to you know take huge
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and it may be unfair
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
for the utility or it may be unfair the
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
way that they're approaching this
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
so i think it is reasonable to discuss
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
potentially capping this at a dollar
 
04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
value per year okay so in my situation
 
04:40:48.150 --> 04:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a family farm
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
and our electric bills
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
we are not spending more than ten
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
04:40:54.390 --> 04:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of you know
 
04:40:55.750 --> 04:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're small but we're not spending more
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
than 10 grand on any of our electric
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
bills but we could get up there when
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of agriculture has a
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
family chicken farm and it has many
 
04:41:12.310 --> 04:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
properties with many utility meters
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper obviously i i know
 
04:41:16.708 --> 04:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
he's neutral on this bill but i want to
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
just say that as an example of an ag
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
implication where there are many meters
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
and many properties it may make sense
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
that the cap be something that's still
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable but not obscene for you know
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
a monster business so so putting some
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
numbers out there and perhaps coming up
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
with something that's reasonable but not
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
unfair for anyone who could be impacted
 
04:41:37.430 --> 04:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
um two other conversations that i've had
 
04:41:39.910 --> 04:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill were regarding
 
04:41:42.310 --> 04:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the same town
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that i don't think it
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense to limit this by town
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
there may be properties that are across
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
town borders but within the same utility
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that using a town border is
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat arbitrary so i would say it
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to limit this to just
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
one town
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the same for the same street address
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think you would need for for a larger
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
business operation but not a monster
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
business there may be
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know 100 main street 101 main street
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
102 main street 103 main street are all
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
the same owner all the same business you
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't just limit it to 100 main
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
street so
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the same street address
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
so think of this as a rough draft in a
 
04:42:22.798 --> 04:42:24.150 align:start position:0%
so think of this as a rough draft in a
conversation

04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
i do think that there's some opportunity
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
here to make this fair
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a once a year shifting
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity which is what unitil is
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing right now with the business that
 
04:42:35.990 --> 04:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm explaining about i think this should
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
be uniform across all businesses
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
the entire state all utilities and i
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
think that there's some opportunity here
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take some
 
04:42:44.160 --> 04:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take some
questions

04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcwilliams for
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
04:42:50.560 --> 04:42:51.830 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
and

04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the effort you put into
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
talking to other people about it to find
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
out what some of the
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
questions for improvement might be
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
i have one as well
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
did you mean for this bill to apply to
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
business customer generators only or
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
were you thinking that any customer
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
generator would be entitled to this
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this legislation
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
the way it's written it doesn't say
 
04:43:17.520 --> 04:43:18.390 align:start position:0%
the way it's written it doesn't say
business

04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about someone who has
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
more than one meter
 
04:43:22.160 --> 04:43:23.350 align:start position:0%
more than one meter
so

04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
i suppose a landlord could have more
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
than one meter and it's residential but
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
you could also argue that the landlord
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
is a business since they're in the
 
04:43:33.270 --> 04:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
business of renting property
 
04:43:34.948 --> 04:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
so i don't think the intention is that
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
this solely applied to businesses the
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
intention is that it applied to places
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
where there are more than one meter
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative platt is
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
it recognized yes thank you mr chair
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
have you thought about the reaction a
 
04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
person in the
 
04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
billing department of utility might have
 
04:43:58.390 --> 04:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
with something like this it just strikes
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
me as
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
blowing their minds
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
changing from you know one monthly from
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
one meter to another trying to keep be
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
able to do that in any kind of
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
constructive fashion have you have you
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
had any reaction from the utilities
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
the great question i have not received
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
specific feedback from the utilities
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
regarding billing and i look forward to
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
04:44:25.920 --> 04:44:27.430 align:start position:0%
okay um
representative

04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:44:27.440 --> 04:44:35.350 align:start position:0%
representative
pimentel

04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for reminding me to turn
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
do you get two separate electric bills
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
or are both meters on the same bill
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
so full disclosure i actually received
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
three electric bills um but one is just
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
for a street light that's pretty typical
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
for a farm
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i have a follow-up
 
04:44:56.878 --> 04:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
and i have a follow-up
follow-up

04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:44:57.920 --> 04:44:58.948 align:start position:0%
follow-up
and

04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:00.788 --> 04:45:00.798 align:start position:0%
your question about whether or not it
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
would apply to residences
 
04:45:03.120 --> 04:45:04.230 align:start position:0%
would apply to residences
um

04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
i know people who have
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
two meters one is for their heating
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
because they're electric heat and they
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
get a different rate as opposed to
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
everything else and would that
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
be something that might be in
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
reason for allowing them to
 
04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
have both meters
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
work for their
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
electric solar
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's a really interesting
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
proposition i think that for a residence
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
that has two meters but one is for
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
electric heat if they're going to do
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of energy production whether
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's wind or solar
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams please
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
speak into the mic i know you want to
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
have eye contact with the questioner but
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
we can't hear you is this better
 
04:45:50.958 --> 04:45:52.470 align:start position:0%
we can't hear you is this better
um

04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you have a residence
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
and they have two meters one of which is
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
electric uh for electric heat they're
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
both electricity meters but one's for
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
electric heat and the other is just for
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
general use like lighting um
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
and they're either installing or have
 
04:46:06.718 --> 04:46:07.830 align:start position:0%
and they're either installing or have
installed

04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
installed
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a discussion at
 
04:46:16.150 --> 04:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
the time of installation about applying
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
the energy
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
credit to the electric heat account
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
unless there's a reason
 
04:46:25.350 --> 04:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't want to do that so
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
just out the gate you'd want to be
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
reducing that bill because obviously
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
that could be a very heavy load for
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
residential heat i don't know anything
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
about the specifics on this constituent
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
that you're describing
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
but it makes sense to start out with
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
reducing the more expensive bill
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then being able to transfer over
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
some of that surplus to the other bill
 
04:46:47.520 --> 04:46:48.390 align:start position:0%
some of that surplus to the other bill
so

04:46:48.390 --> 04:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
i guess big picture i think you would
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
want to start with the electric heat
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
bill first to be reduced from your
 
04:46:55.360 --> 04:46:59.430 align:start position:0%
bill first to be reduced from your
generation

04:46:59.430 --> 04:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
sorry i forgot representative jackie
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
i was following you
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
for a little bit and i was thinking that
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
you were trying to
 
04:47:17.040 --> 04:47:18.070 align:start position:0%
you were trying to
help

04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
04:47:20.000 --> 04:47:21.750 align:start position:0%
small businesses
and

04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:21.760 --> 04:47:23.510 align:start position:0%
and
homeowners

04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
04:47:25.350 --> 04:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
have you thought about using the word
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
contiguous property because then it
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
seems like you could go
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know you talked about towns and
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
split that's where i lost you
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
i was thinking of
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
contiguous property in other words so
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
your situation would be
 
04:47:39.760 --> 04:47:41.190 align:start position:0%
your situation would be
that

04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
if if i'm interpreting it correctly
 
04:47:44.550 --> 04:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
there's a store
 
04:47:46.788 --> 04:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
and a house and they're on the same
 
04:47:46.798 --> 04:47:48.628 align:start position:0%
and a house and they're on the same
property

04:47:48.628 --> 04:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
have you have you continue considered
 
04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
that as a beginning
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
i have considered contiguous property
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
i think that that still can be limiting
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about a small business
 
04:48:06.788 --> 04:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
who has two locations in one town
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
and they're both owned by the same
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
person or business name
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
and they're both under the same utility
 
04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
and one of them has a solar array
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
why would we want to say that the second
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
one couldn't get a credit off of the
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill more than once a year because
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're not contiguous it just seems a
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
little arbitrary to to insist on having
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
land location associated with
 
04:48:29.760 --> 04:48:30.868 align:start position:0%
land location associated with
credit

04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
credit
 
04:48:30.878 --> 04:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
credit
when

04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
there are two bills you have a surplus
 
04:48:36.070 --> 04:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
on one they're both bills that are going
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
to your business why would you want it
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:44.638 --> 04:48:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
this marine once said to me at the gate
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
of a base i am asking the questions lady
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
what i was not con
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
contesting the annual
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
monthly i think is a good idea because
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
you you're producing every month
 
04:49:05.760 --> 04:49:06.550 align:start position:0%
you you're producing every month
but

04:49:06.550 --> 04:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
the contiguous was what i was
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
thinking on not not the amount that it
 
04:49:15.270 --> 04:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
would be a year a month quarterly
 
04:49:15.280 --> 04:49:16.868 align:start position:0%
would be a year a month quarterly
whatever

04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
that that had nothing to do with what i
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
was thinking about was contiguous
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
property so i think contiguous
 
04:49:26.550 --> 04:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
inherently becomes limiting
 
04:49:26.560 --> 04:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
inherently becomes limiting
because

04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
it means that your business needs to buy
 
04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
out the neighbor
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
instead of buying the property three
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
houses down or you know if we're in a
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
downtown the property three business is
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
down it limits your expansion
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity because you are also
 
04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
considering oh the rules say i have to
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
stay within this footprint and grow as
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
an amoeba
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
rather than i'm allowed to hopscotch
 
04:49:50.230 --> 04:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
around and pick another location to get
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
the benefit so it seems
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit limiting with
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
with not a good reason why it should be
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman okay so
 
04:50:08.230 --> 04:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
i've been with you i think it's a good
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
idea that you should be able to sort of
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
exercise your credit and if you have
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
multiple accounts
 
04:50:14.948 --> 04:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps um
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
leverage one credit toward the other
 
04:50:17.840 --> 04:50:19.110 align:start position:0%
leverage one credit toward the other
bill

04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:50:20.628 --> 04:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
but the thing that i was thinking as i'm
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
listening to you testify is if you have
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
a credit on one of the bills
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
income back like if you have that credit
 
04:50:33.670 --> 04:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
why does it have to be applied to the
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
other bill
 
04:50:37.830 --> 04:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
so just to give an example um i believe
 
04:50:37.840 --> 04:50:38.868 align:start position:0%
so just to give an example um i believe
april

04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
april
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
if unitil's here they will correct me
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i believe april is the month that
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
i'm allowed to apply the credit to the
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
deficit um but i have to report my
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
earnings for the farm december december
 
04:50:50.400 --> 04:50:51.670 align:start position:0%
earnings for the farm december december
31st

04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
31st
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i've got the solar system cranking
 
04:50:55.750 --> 04:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
out all kinds of positive energy and
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
giving me a positive credit on the bill
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
all summer and even into the fall
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
so i've racked up a significant chunk of
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
change that i would love to apply to the
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
other bill oh but you can't but i can't
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year i have to hold it
 
04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
over and then correct it in april the
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
following year right so from a business
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
perspective that makes it a little wonky
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the accounting side
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
and also i would like to actually have
 
04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
that money that i would be spending on
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
the second bill
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
to buy and take care of other things in
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
the off season during the winter so it
 
04:51:28.550 --> 04:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
means that those funds that i would be
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
change move over instead i have to pay
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
out of pocket and wait to get reimbursed
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
in april but when we're talking about
 
04:51:37.750 --> 04:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
the farming season the most important
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
purchases you make are in january we're
 
04:51:44.070 --> 04:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
buying lights soil seeds right now but i
 
04:51:44.080 --> 04:51:45.110 align:start position:0%
buying lights soil seeds right now but i
can't

04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
spend as much as i would like
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
because there's this
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
huge cost on one of my electric bills
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
and there's this huge credit on the
 
04:51:55.350 --> 04:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
other electric bill i can't touch right
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
now so great it just doesn't seem fair
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
as was you know fairness and also a
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
uniform policy that's exactly what i was
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
looking for is because i felt like there
 
04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
was something missing in here that i
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
didn't understand about why this would
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
be of value so that makes perfect sense
 
04:52:12.150 --> 04:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll now turn to our next
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
presenter and thank you representative
 
04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
mick williams thank
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
you i'd like to call on donna gamache of
 
04:52:26.000 --> 04:52:30.788 align:start position:0%
you i'd like to call on donna gamache of
eversource

04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
please turn on the microphone
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you danica bosh with eversource
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's okay representative mick williams
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
my apologies for not reaching out to you
 
04:52:47.350 --> 04:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
in advance of the hearing which is
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
typically what i like to do
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
not a sob story but
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
i had an administrative assistant who
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
retired and now i'm manually going
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
through hundreds of legislation and
 
04:52:59.670 --> 04:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
getting feedback and compiling them and
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
figuring them out so i'm behind very
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
behind my apologies
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i did not take a position on the bill
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
the company does not take a position on
 
04:53:09.990 --> 04:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bill but um generally speaking what
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
we would like to ask for if you decide
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill is cost recovery um
 
04:53:16.390 --> 04:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
there are other bills in the legislature
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
this session to do something very
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
similar and i've been speaking with the
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors of those bills as well as
 
04:53:24.708 --> 04:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
i've been getting phone calls from some
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the individuals who would be impacted
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
who've requested the bills and they have
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
a hard time understanding that currently
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
we provide credits
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
to our customer or you know the payout
 
04:53:41.670 --> 04:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
um once a year and we do it manually we
 
04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
have we do not have a system in place a
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
billing system in place to do it because
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
we don't we have
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's it hasn't grown it's clear to me
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
that if we start passing all these bills
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
it will grow because one of this sounds
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
like a group net what you're trying to
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
do is group net meter without group net
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
metering and that's where i think you're
 
04:54:01.990 --> 04:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
getting the once annually because group
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
net metering has a specific requirement
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
versus just regular net metering or just
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
you having a solar array on your on your
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
on your property so um we i have tried
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
to find out exactly what the cost would
 
04:54:19.190 --> 04:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
be associated with this type of a change
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i've been told that rit department
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
will not give me
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
a quote they won't even give me a
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
bandwidth of an because i tried because
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
they said they would have to design it
 
04:54:30.868 --> 04:54:30.878 align:start position:0%
first so what we would have to do is
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
either design it it would be millions of
 
04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
dollars or we would have to hire more if
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
we chose to continue to do it manually
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have to hire more people so just
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the event that you do want to pass a
 
04:54:42.788 --> 04:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
bill like this we would just like to
 
04:54:44.390 --> 04:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that allows for cost
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
recovery sad to say but it's it it
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
appears um over the years that it's um
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's really important when we do go
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
before the regulator that we're really
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
explicit so that's why we tend to ask
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
for cost recovery for this thank you
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
ms gamache
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you you mentioned
 
04:55:05.280 --> 04:55:06.868 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you you mentioned
that

04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is attempting to do something
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
very similar to what group net metering
 
04:55:14.070 --> 04:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
does could that solve
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
the problem that representative mick
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
williams was discussing i think the
 
04:55:18.080 --> 04:55:19.190 align:start position:0%
williams was discussing i think the
problem

04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:55:20.550 --> 04:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is that group net
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
metering the the requirements for the
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
payouts do not align with what she's
 
04:55:27.430 --> 04:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
looking to do i have another bill that
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
is trying to make the same kind of a
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
change for group net metering as well
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you any additional
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative oxenum got to raise your
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
hand a little bit higher
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:55:48.550 --> 04:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh just taking advantage of the
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity that you're here and if i
 
04:55:51.200 --> 04:55:51.990 align:start position:0%
opportunity that you're here and if i
may

04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
with your indulgence mr chair let's go
 
04:55:54.480 --> 04:55:56.150 align:start position:0%
with your indulgence mr chair let's go
ahead

04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
an issue has arisen
 
04:55:58.160 --> 04:55:59.590 align:start position:0%
an issue has arisen
in

04:55:59.590 --> 04:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
two of the four towns i represent
 
04:56:05.110 --> 04:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
where they are trying to create a solar
 
04:56:05.120 --> 04:56:06.708 align:start position:0%
where they are trying to create a solar
array

04:56:06.708 --> 04:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
array
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
the one town has the land where a solar
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
array could go
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
town has the people who could be off
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
takers because the little bit of land in
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
the one town is just over the edge it
 
04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
has very few people in the territory
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
so with
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
with the multiple definitions where it
 
04:56:28.390 --> 04:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
has to be within the same town has to be
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
within the same utility et cetera et
 
04:56:31.830 --> 04:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera
 
04:56:31.840 --> 04:56:33.030 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera
how

04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:56:36.868 --> 04:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
is there a way to resolve this
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
that would not
 
04:56:41.040 --> 04:56:42.470 align:start position:0%
that would not
prohibit

04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh towns the town boundary i i perhaps
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
it was a prime sponsor who who used the
 
04:56:50.390 --> 04:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
words that why should the town boundary
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
be at issue here as long as it's within
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
the same utility territory and you have
 
04:56:57.430 --> 04:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
your group host and you have your array
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
and you have your members
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be sufficient
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
i would have to double check
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
i really would have to double check on
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
the group net metering because i'm not
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
i cannot remember that there is a
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
requirement that would be in the same
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
town just as long as it had to be in the
 
04:57:15.910 --> 04:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
same utility but i would have to double
 
04:57:15.920 --> 04:57:16.868 align:start position:0%
same utility but i would have to double
check

04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
check
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
on that i could be wrong um i would have
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
to i
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
i would really love to double check that
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i wanted to throw
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
out is that um you know group net
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
metering net metering group net metering
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
over the years as it's evolved there's
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
always been this eye toward balance like
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
balancing the costs for others etc
 
04:57:36.080 --> 04:57:36.948 align:start position:0%
balancing the costs for others etc
and

04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
as a result of trying to find that
 
04:57:39.990 --> 04:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
balance we've seen that there have been
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
new opportunities open up to do
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
something that we might not have thought
 
04:57:44.948 --> 04:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
about before and i'll bet your area has
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
already thought about this but i wanted
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
to throw it out anyway maybe community
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
aggregation using that generator
 
04:57:54.628 --> 04:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
might might be an opportunity also
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know thank you for that and um
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
our playing field is
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
pursuing community power aggregation but
 
04:58:02.230 --> 04:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at least at this point
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
cornish is not so uh
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
it gives us an opportunity to encourage
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
them thank you thank you i'll check on
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for your indulgence
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely i think
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
statute that we passed last year
 
04:58:22.788 --> 04:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
might confine it to a single
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
municipality but i'm not sure that the
 
04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
other it is and it's between the one and
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
five megawatts that that applies but i'm
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
not sure about the the regular group net
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
metering as opposed to the municipal but
 
04:58:38.550 --> 04:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:58:41.360 --> 04:58:42.230 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
mrs um

04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
mrs um
 
04:58:42.240 --> 04:58:44.788 align:start position:0%
mrs um
uh

04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.798 --> 04:58:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
gamash

04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
gamash
 
04:58:46.080 --> 04:58:47.350 align:start position:0%
gamash
um

04:58:47.350 --> 04:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh cost issue
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
certainly if you have to do things
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
manually that's gonna be an ongoing cost
 
04:58:58.708 --> 04:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
would the software upgrade be like a
 
04:58:58.718 --> 04:59:00.230 align:start position:0%
would the software upgrade be like a
one-time

04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
expense is that
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
would that be correct to assume um it's
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
a one-time expense to install to design
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
and install and then they have the
 
04:59:12.628 --> 04:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
upkeep the uh maintenance of it is so
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing but we have i mean we
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
have billing systems now we've upgraded
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
our billing system a few years ago um so
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that we do it's just that
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
we need to get cost recovery if we're
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
going to do it again
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
i got a follow-up
 
04:59:27.040 --> 04:59:28.230 align:start position:0%
i got a follow-up
follow-up

04:59:28.230 --> 04:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:59:29.830 --> 04:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
and how would that work would you go to
 
04:59:29.840 --> 04:59:30.708 align:start position:0%
and how would that work would you go to
the

04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
puc to
 
04:59:34.628 --> 04:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
put this into your formula for the
 
04:59:36.550 --> 04:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
following year that sort of thing so
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
we'd have to go to the p we'd have to go
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
to the puc to get approval for doing
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
what we're doing they'd have to agree
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
that what we've chosen is the least cost
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
um because there's probably many ways to
 
04:59:48.150 --> 04:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
skin the cat and so we'd want to make
 
04:59:49.270 --> 04:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we're doing it in the way that
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
we actually get the desired outcome but
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
we haven't overspent for nothing so
 
04:59:55.750 --> 04:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then working oh that was another one
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you asked this question because
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
i wondered if the um
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
if we could look at the um the effective
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
date we might need a little more time
 
05:00:06.310 --> 05:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
because i mean we have we have half a
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
million more than a half a million
 
05:00:09.910 --> 05:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
customers as i said before but some of
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
the other utilities in the state have
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
less so the impacts are different for
 
05:00:15.910 --> 05:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
each of the utilities so it might take a
 
05:00:18.788 --> 05:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
little longer to figure this one out
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you mr chair thank
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question ms gamache
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
the way i understand utility rate making
 
05:00:32.708 --> 05:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
works is you could be in for a rate case
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
every five years say
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
but you spend 300 350 million dollars on
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
a system in the middle of that
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
without talking with the commission that
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
could fall through the cracks right
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
because you could say well you spent the
 
05:00:43.840 --> 05:00:44.708 align:start position:0%
because you could say well you spent the
money

05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
it's a new rate case doesn't show up in
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
the test test here that was spent before
 
05:00:52.230 --> 05:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
so tough luck cookies no bad cookies
 
05:00:52.240 --> 05:00:53.590 align:start position:0%
so tough luck cookies no bad cookies
right

05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
well i'd say that you're you're
 
05:00:58.150 --> 05:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
generally correct um we we do our best
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure it doesn't fall through the
 
05:01:03.030 --> 05:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
cracks but we do have to account for
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
in between the rate cases we have to
 
05:01:06.550 --> 05:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
account for every decision we make why
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
made why we did it and why the costs
 
05:01:11.110 --> 05:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
were what they were and we are always
 
05:01:13.910 --> 05:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
always every utility is always at risk
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
of um being denied cost recovery
 
05:01:16.958 --> 05:01:20.708 align:start position:0%
of um being denied cost recovery
so

05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:20.718 --> 05:01:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions for
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
ms gamache i want to thank you for
 
05:01:29.590 --> 05:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
testifying ms gamache and i want to
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank representative mick williams for
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
we have no other pink cards for this
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%

05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
we will recess until 2 30 at which time
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
we will take up house bill
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.280 --> 05:02:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%

05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
does that exist anymore it does very
 
05:03:05.040 --> 05:03:10.868 align:start position:0%
does that exist anymore it does very
much

05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%

05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
just seizing my opportunity
 
05:04:04.868 --> 05:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know it's the situation you have
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
like a city like lebanon you know
 
05:04:08.070 --> 05:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's no room
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
to put up a wind turbine or you know and
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's like you know it has to be within
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
the municipal boundaries it's like come
 
05:04:40.270 --> 05:04:40.280 align:start position:0%

is

05:05:24.868 --> 05:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
right correct
 
05:05:26.160 --> 05:05:28.230 align:start position:0%
right correct
okay

05:05:28.230 --> 05:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.680 --> 05:05:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
hey

05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%

so
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna get it because i promised him

to get that so i'll give it to you too
 
05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%

as a matter of fact right printed this
 
05:07:33.510 --> 05:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:35.670 --> 05:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
daily the way center guy remembers it is
 
05:07:35.680 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
daily the way center guy remembers it is
uh

05:07:54.840 --> 05:07:54.850 align:start position:0%

that's what i think guys said we'll see
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.520 --> 05:09:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:29:28.840 --> 05:29:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
personally

05:29:30.390 --> 05:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
personally
 
05:29:34.628 --> 05:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
personally one for you
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:01.680 --> 05:30:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:17.360 --> 05:30:35.590 align:start position:0%
 
because

05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:35.600 --> 05:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.200 --> 05:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
okay it's 2 30
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen so i would like to
 
05:32:07.030 --> 05:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on the next bill
 
05:32:09.628 --> 05:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
on our agenda which is house bill
 
05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
1611 relative to the rules of the site
 
05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
testifying table the bill's prime
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative michael
 
05:32:24.320 --> 05:32:25.510 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative michael
harrington

05:32:25.510 --> 05:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman there we go that's
 
05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
a little better uh i'd like to think
 
05:32:36.390 --> 05:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would be totally
 
05:32:38.390 --> 05:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
uncontroversial but i've been around
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
here too long to realize that that never
 
05:32:41.510 --> 05:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
really happens
 
05:32:41.520 --> 05:32:42.708 align:start position:0%
really happens
so

05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
the whole heart of the bill is in line
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
four if you read it which
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
it basically says that the site
 
05:32:52.470 --> 05:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee must reconvene a
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process to ensure that no
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
authority is assumed to the committee is
 
05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
not specifically authorized in rsa162h
 
05:32:59.600 --> 05:33:00.390 align:start position:0%
not specifically authorized in rsa162h
now

05:33:00.390 --> 05:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
one would say why do you even need that
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
since they shouldn't be writing rules
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
that to implement rsa 162h if they're
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
not in that law
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
well because a few years back that's
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
i have to admit it was between my stint
 
05:33:17.430 --> 05:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
at the puc and getting back in the house
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't know about it until
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
it was going to gel car and it was too
 
05:33:24.390 --> 05:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
late to stop it at that time so the bill
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to change the intent
 
05:33:31.830 --> 05:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the law of rsa 162h it doesn't do uh
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't eliminate or add any new
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
requirements it's cites a few examples
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
of where they clearly the site
 
05:33:40.390 --> 05:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee clearly overstepped
 
05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
the authority and i don't know why
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
gelcard didn't pick that up but they
 
05:33:43.680 --> 05:33:44.868 align:start position:0%
gelcard didn't pick that up but they
didn't

05:33:44.868 --> 05:33:44.878 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
for example if you look down on line 17
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
the rule requires all energy facilities
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
to have an emergency response plan those
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
words don't even appear there's no
 
05:33:56.070 --> 05:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
requirement for an emergency response
 
05:33:57.510 --> 05:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
plan now you may think that's a good
 
05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
idea or a bad idea but it's the
 
05:34:01.990 --> 05:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislature that decides that not the
 
05:34:03.590 --> 05:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee there's a
 
05:34:06.230 --> 05:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of well unelected bureaucrats
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
and um they should be making the
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
decisions well i'm not going to read the
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
whole bill to you because the rest of it
 
05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
basically does the same thing but the
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
the heart of it is in that uh line four
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
and five and
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
i've also been requested a a
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
another a minor change to this which
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
would add on to the end
 
05:34:25.590 --> 05:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
of line five
 
05:34:27.910 --> 05:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
or which contravenes the declaration of
 
05:34:30.708 --> 05:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
purpose or requirements of rsa 162h
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
which just makes it even clearer that
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
the intent of the rules should be the
 
05:34:37.030 --> 05:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
rules should reflect the intent of the
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
law and not what people think might be a
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
good idea and with that i'll take
 
05:34:41.040 --> 05:34:43.110 align:start position:0%
good idea and with that i'll take
questions

05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you could you repeat that text you
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
want to add to line five please
 
05:34:51.750 --> 05:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
or which contravenes the declaration of
 
05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:03.430 --> 05:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make sure everyone's
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
clear on this
 
05:35:07.590 --> 05:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make any changes to the law
 
05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it just tells the site
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee hey get it right
 
05:35:14.310 --> 05:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
this time go make up a set of rules that
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
comply with the law and not new
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
requirements that you may must think is
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
a good idea if they want to make changes
 
05:35:23.830 --> 05:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
to the law they should petition the
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislature to make those changes but
 
05:35:27.510 --> 05:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't just put in rules that have no
 
05:35:29.670 --> 05:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
basis in laws because remember once a
 
05:35:31.270 --> 05:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
rule becomes effective it has the effect
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
of law
 
05:35:33.990 --> 05:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
so in effect we've had the site
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee passing laws
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you can you explain what that
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
new text or which contravenes the
 
05:35:44.548 --> 05:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
declaration of the purpose or
 
05:35:46.868 --> 05:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
requirements it was i received that as a
 
05:35:49.510 --> 05:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
comment and i think it just tries to uh
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
bring it uh home
 
05:35:51.600 --> 05:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
bring it uh home
um

05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
a little clearer that it's you know
 
05:35:56.230 --> 05:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to be are there any
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
questions from any members of the
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
committee about
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill or how it goes
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:10.708 --> 05:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas thank you mr
 
05:36:13.270 --> 05:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh i
 
05:36:15.270 --> 05:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
believe i understand what i heard you
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
say but for my own clarity
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
in essence then this bill would
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
essentially say
 
05:36:22.160 --> 05:36:23.030 align:start position:0%
essentially say
any

05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
rules that the site evaluation committee
 
05:36:26.160 --> 05:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
rules that the site evaluation committee
makes

05:36:27.430 --> 05:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
makes
 
05:36:28.548 --> 05:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
must be
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
a direct subset to a law
 
05:36:32.548 --> 05:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
a state law
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
it has been directly related to a
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
specific law that's in the rsa
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
that is correct what happened was there
 
05:36:42.070 --> 05:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
was a major change to rsa 162h
 
05:36:44.470 --> 05:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
most of which addressed new requirements
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
for wind facilities there was like an
 
05:36:46.638 --> 05:36:47.510 align:start position:0%
for wind facilities there was like an
extra

05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
extra
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
page or two added in specifically for
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
wind facilities and wind facilities go
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
implement those and those were the
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
sections 100 through 300. the problem
 
05:37:06.868 --> 05:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
was they didn't just implement what was
 
05:37:09.590 --> 05:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the the new law change they put in a
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
lot of other stuff that doesn't appear
 
05:37:13.430 --> 05:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the law or appears only for
 
05:37:13.440 --> 05:37:14.230 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the law or appears only for
wind

05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
wind
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
plants facilities and they applied it to
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
other non-wind facilities
 
05:37:20.070 --> 05:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
so this just says go back and get it
 
05:37:22.150 --> 05:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
right this time
 
05:37:24.948 --> 05:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
05:37:26.948 --> 05:37:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt is recognized
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
for a question just making certain i
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
understand representative harrington
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
05:37:33.910 --> 05:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
would require them to go back and review
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
their rules and take some out that are
 
05:37:36.000 --> 05:37:36.948 align:start position:0%
their rules and take some out that are
not

05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
supported by laws is that correct that
 
05:37:40.708 --> 05:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
is correct they'd have to make the law
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
the rules again it's the
 
05:37:45.670 --> 05:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that no authority is assumed to
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
the committee that is not specifically
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:55.990 --> 05:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative creation has a question
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.830 --> 05:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that gelcar and the
 
05:38:13.750 --> 05:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the site evaluation committee
 
05:38:15.670 --> 05:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
is to come up with these specific rules
 
05:38:17.510 --> 05:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that we do not have to
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
list every single thing that you can or
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
cannot do in statutes so this seems to
 
05:38:22.558 --> 05:38:24.470 align:start position:0%
cannot do in statutes so this seems to
me

05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:38:25.830 --> 05:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
feeling like we're taking um
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
authority that should proper
 
05:38:32.548 --> 05:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
expertise that should probably be in gel
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
car and the sec
 
05:38:36.390 --> 05:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
and trying to subsume it all directly
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
into the legislature at this level of
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
minutia that we're not suited to do
 
05:38:43.590 --> 05:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
well let me respond to you by this um
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
without naming anybody's name uh when
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
this was going to gelcar i called up a
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
senator who was on gel car at the time
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
and tried to explain to him uh what my
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
concerns were and this is almost a
 
05:38:56.948 --> 05:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
direct quote look we're not changing
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
anything we don't know what the hell
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about anyways so to say
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
that there's some expertise on gel car
 
05:39:04.150 --> 05:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
on site evaluations for energy
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
facilities is a is a misunderstanding on
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
your part
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
and second this gets very specific for
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
example this isn't like you know have a
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
rule to implement the following there is
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
no mention of the word emergency
 
05:39:21.190 --> 05:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
response plan whatsoever in the uh on
 
05:39:23.590 --> 05:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
62h and i don't know if you're familiar
 
05:39:25.110 --> 05:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
with that type of stuff but if you talk
 
05:39:27.110 --> 05:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
putting an emergency response plan you
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
can be talking you know 20 30 pages of
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
requirements and all sorts of uh
 
05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
protocols on who gets called when and
 
05:39:37.350 --> 05:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
connections with the with the uh the
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
police and fire department and they're
 
05:39:41.030 --> 05:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to want to say okay well then we
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
want to have our own phones or or
 
05:39:44.868 --> 05:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
whatever or some kind of a direct
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
communication link and so forth
 
05:39:50.470 --> 05:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
those were never contemplated in 162
 
05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh h now i'm not saying those aren't
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
good ideas i'm not saying they're bad
 
05:39:55.750 --> 05:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
ideas i'm just saying they don't they
 
05:39:57.670 --> 05:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't exist in the law and they were
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
fabricated by the site evaluation
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
committee it's not where you can say
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
well this you said a and we could infer
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
b we said a and we just made up b so
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i put this out here
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.670 --> 05:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay can i follow up yes please follow
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
up um i guess could you give me then an
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
example of you know something that would
 
05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for rulemaking authority
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
what's the point i guess of having the
 
05:40:27.030 --> 05:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority under gel car if
 
05:40:29.830 --> 05:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're specifying to them exactly
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
the limits of what they're doing like
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
what are they adding to the product
 
05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
first of all you you back to gel car
 
05:40:35.280 --> 05:40:36.390 align:start position:0%
first of all you you back to gel car
again

05:40:36.390 --> 05:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
there the rules are to get more specific
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
and detailed on what is put into the law
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
so for example if the law said
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
all energy facilities shall have an
 
05:40:50.948 --> 05:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
emergency response plan the rules of
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
which shall be uh developed uh
 
05:40:53.440 --> 05:41:06.708 align:start position:0%
which shall be uh developed uh
whatsoever

05:41:06.708 --> 05:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
any facility and they say we're going to
 
05:41:10.708 --> 05:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
apply this to every facility that's a
 
05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
major change that could cost the
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
facility thousands of dollars
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
and it was never put into the law and
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
they decided it was a good idea well if
 
05:41:20.788 --> 05:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea the site evaluation
 
05:41:22.310 --> 05:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee should have come back and
 
05:41:24.150 --> 05:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
asked someone to submit a change to the
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
law and then run it through the
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome okay
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative pementel is recognized
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
05:41:40.310 --> 05:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:46.470 --> 05:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:41:49.430 --> 05:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative harrington uh
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm wondering about the fact
 
05:41:52.080 --> 05:41:52.868 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm wondering about the fact
that

05:41:52.868 --> 05:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
you're saying that
 
05:41:57.270 --> 05:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
that other facilities don't
 
05:41:57.280 --> 05:41:58.310 align:start position:0%
that other facilities don't
need

05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
need
 
05:41:58.320 --> 05:42:08.628 align:start position:0%
need
site

05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
that as a for instance when
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
the seabrook power plant was there was
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
an extensive
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
emergency response plan that was part of
 
05:42:18.638 --> 05:42:19.590 align:start position:0%
emergency response plan that was part of
the

05:42:19.590 --> 05:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
licensing of that facility
 
05:42:22.400 --> 05:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
licensing of that facility
is

05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:42:24.000 --> 05:42:24.788 align:start position:0%
is
that

05:42:24.788 --> 05:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
not something
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:42:32.470 --> 05:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
another energy facility with a
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
with an emergency spot response plan
 
05:42:36.868 --> 05:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
well the emergency response plan for
 
05:42:39.350 --> 05:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
seabrook is
 
05:42:41.510 --> 05:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
about that high if it was still on paper
 
05:42:43.990 --> 05:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
and it's thousands and thousands of
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
pages uh and it involves all sorts of
 
05:42:47.670 --> 05:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
things that you couldn't even envision i
 
05:42:50.868 --> 05:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
was involved in developing part of that
 
05:42:53.430 --> 05:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
and it's required by the nrc to have one
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
this is what i'm talking about here is
 
05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
again it's not whether it's a good idea
 
05:42:59.110 --> 05:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
to have an emergency response plan or
 
05:43:01.830 --> 05:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
not it's who should make that decision
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the decision is clearly with the
 
05:43:05.190 --> 05:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
legislature who sets the laws and not
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
with the site evaluation committee you
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
know if you took the attitude that they
 
05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
could do whatever they want they could
 
05:43:13.030 --> 05:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
come up and say you know every uh win
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
facility must put down a million dollars
 
05:43:18.948 --> 05:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh in escrow to make sure they have uh
 
05:43:21.030 --> 05:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
cause no damage in the future and it's
 
05:43:22.548 --> 05:43:22.558 align:start position:0%
not in the law anywhere they don't have
 
05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to do it it's not a matter
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
of whether it's a good idea or a bad
 
05:43:29.110 --> 05:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
idea it's whose idea was it and those
 
05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
ideas are supposed to come through the
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
legislative process and get passed into
 
05:43:35.510 --> 05:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
law not go through the rules process the
 
05:43:37.030 --> 05:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
rules are supposed to be based on the
 
05:43:37.040 --> 05:43:40.470 align:start position:0%
rules are supposed to be based on the
law

05:43:40.470 --> 05:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:43:47.830 --> 05:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i want to narrow down what the
 
05:43:49.830 --> 05:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
the focus of your bill is
 
05:43:49.840 --> 05:43:51.350 align:start position:0%
the focus of your bill is
um

05:43:51.350 --> 05:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
they were the sec was supposed to write
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
rules for
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
wind generation as i understand it
 
05:43:59.120 --> 05:44:00.628 align:start position:0%
wind generation as i understand it
and

05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:44:02.868 --> 05:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
one of their rules was
 
05:44:05.350 --> 05:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
for a site evalu site
 
05:44:05.360 --> 05:44:06.868 align:start position:0%
for a site evalu site
uh

05:44:06.868 --> 05:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:06.878 --> 05:44:07.830 align:start position:0%
uh
sorry

05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
visual impact assessment the site
 
05:44:10.840 --> 05:44:12.390 align:start position:0%
visual impact assessment the site
uh

05:44:12.390 --> 05:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:14.470 --> 05:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
emergency plan or whatever
 
05:44:14.480 --> 05:44:16.310 align:start position:0%
emergency plan or whatever
um

05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
and is your is are you saying that they
 
05:44:21.430 --> 05:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
either or
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
05:44:27.270 --> 05:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about it being
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:44:41.110 --> 05:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:41.120 --> 05:44:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
each

05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
each
 
05:44:44.310 --> 05:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh and most of it addressed concerns
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:44:48.070 --> 05:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
raised about various wind uh facilities
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
some of which were you know making sure
 
05:44:52.628 --> 05:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
they had funding for decommissioning uh
 
05:44:54.150 --> 05:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
in the future which wasn't in which
 
05:44:56.150 --> 05:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the law before that and
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other proposals
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
specifically addressing win facilities
 
05:45:00.638 --> 05:45:01.590 align:start position:0%
specifically addressing win facilities
now

05:45:01.590 --> 05:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:45:03.510 --> 05:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine they had a rule-making
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
process and they went through and they
 
05:45:06.868 --> 05:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
should have implemented those or laws
 
05:45:08.868 --> 05:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
and put them into rules the fact is they
 
05:45:10.470 --> 05:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
put him in but they put in a lot of
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
stuff that wasn't in the law and that's
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
my concern here it's not the quality of
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
whether an emergency response plan is a
 
05:45:18.628 --> 05:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
good idea or a bad idea or whether a
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
situatis a visual impact assessment or
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should be a sound
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
assessment and fire protection plans my
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
point is the law says they're only to be
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
applied certain ways and that's the way
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
the rules should reflect so if you want
 
05:45:34.948 --> 05:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
to change the law change the law if you
 
05:45:36.788 --> 05:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
want to write a rule it better follow
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:45.670 --> 05:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite following you
 
05:45:52.948 --> 05:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
because jalkar accepted these jalcock
 
05:45:55.590 --> 05:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
when a rule is accepted it becomes a
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
part of the law correct
 
05:45:59.670 --> 05:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me a question when a
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
rule is becomes effective it has the
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
force of law it doesn't become part of
 
05:46:07.030 --> 05:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
the statute so it has the force of law
 
05:46:07.040 --> 05:46:09.190 align:start position:0%
the statute so it has the force of law
and

05:46:09.190 --> 05:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
those rules that
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee
 
05:46:16.948 --> 05:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
made were they made in response to a
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.948 --> 05:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
no they were there was a series of win
 
05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
projects being developed at the time in
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
the state and there was a lot of
 
05:46:28.708 --> 05:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
concerns raised at the site evaluation
 
05:46:30.470 --> 05:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee on those projects as far as
 
05:46:32.470 --> 05:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
like i said decommissioning
 
05:46:35.350 --> 05:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh visual assessments and so forth that
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
what it wasn't included in the uh law so
 
05:46:40.788 --> 05:46:40.798 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in the rules either and as a
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
result of that the law was changed
 
05:46:45.190 --> 05:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
substantially okay most of it which
 
05:46:47.350 --> 05:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
addressed dressed win facilities
 
05:46:48.788 --> 05:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
and then they had to initiate a new
 
05:46:50.628 --> 05:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
rule-making process to implement those
 
05:46:53.430 --> 05:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
changes to the law what they did was
 
05:46:55.590 --> 05:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
they implemented other changes that were
 
05:46:58.230 --> 05:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
never in the change to the law so this
 
05:47:00.310 --> 05:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
idea of emergency response plan doesn't
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
appear in 162h it's not there
 
05:47:06.230 --> 05:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
the sound assessment is only for wind
 
05:47:09.110 --> 05:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
energy facilities it's not for solar
 
05:47:12.070 --> 05:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.070 --> 05:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
and they just they did this and then it
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
went through the process and as i told
 
05:47:17.990 --> 05:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
you when when i tried to intervene in
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
when speaking to people on gel car i was
 
05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
basically told that we don't know what
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
the hell you talking about anyway so
 
05:47:29.030 --> 05:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:29.040 --> 05:47:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:47:30.470 --> 05:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
how long have these rules i mean i was
 
05:47:35.430 --> 05:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
here in the inception of wind how long
 
05:47:39.430 --> 05:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head i hope to make i
 
05:47:43.270 --> 05:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
could only make a guess it's probably
 
05:47:43.280 --> 05:47:45.030 align:start position:0%
could only make a guess it's probably
been

05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:47:48.470 --> 05:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
five or six years i'm guessing is when
 
05:47:50.470 --> 05:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
that last uh when they went through it
 
05:47:52.708 --> 05:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
was i know it was in it was the
 
05:47:55.590 --> 05:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of it was in january and so it
 
05:47:56.788 --> 05:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative representative platt
 
05:48:06.788 --> 05:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking a
 
05:48:09.190 --> 05:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
question representative harrington
 
05:48:11.750 --> 05:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
you see nothing wrong however with the
 
05:48:13.430 --> 05:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
let's say say the evaluation committee
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
sings uh
 
05:48:19.590 --> 05:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:19.600 --> 05:48:20.788 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:48:23.350 --> 05:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
so on to come to the legislature come to
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
this committee or other appropriate
 
05:48:26.788 --> 05:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
committees to get law changed to
 
05:48:28.470 --> 05:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
implement that is that correct
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely if they thought it was a good
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
idea that then they should bring it here
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
whoops i have a question for you
 
05:48:45.350 --> 05:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative i forgot to turn on the
 
05:48:45.360 --> 05:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative i forgot to turn on the
mic

the authors of rules
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
have to specifically refer to this or
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
identify rather the specific section of
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
state law
 
05:49:50.070 --> 05:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
when they write that rule
 
05:49:52.470 --> 05:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes i do and as a matter of fact that
 
05:49:53.990 --> 05:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
was something that i enforced rather
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
rigorously when i was on the puc and
 
05:49:58.390 --> 05:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
told people that they had to tie any
 
05:50:02.948 --> 05:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
proposed rule changes back to statute

a project
 
05:50:17.430 --> 05:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
has come about
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
and there are no
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
state laws referring to that project
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
such as they would not have been with
 
05:50:27.350 --> 05:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy they would not have been
 
05:50:31.590 --> 05:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
with some of the solar things we had
 
05:50:35.110 --> 05:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
would that project have to be held off
 
05:50:37.110 --> 05:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
until the
 
05:50:41.190 --> 05:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
legislature convened and at such time
 
05:50:44.470 --> 05:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
got together and decided what
 
05:50:47.190 --> 05:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
these rules should be i seem to think
 
05:50:48.948 --> 05:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
antrim win
 
05:50:50.708 --> 05:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
sticks out in my mind
 
05:50:50.718 --> 05:50:51.590 align:start position:0%
sticks out in my mind
that

05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:53.430 --> 05:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
there are projects
 
05:50:56.070 --> 05:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
that the legislature and things
 
05:50:59.110 --> 05:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
especially energy producers that the la
 
05:51:02.310 --> 05:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature had not thought of
 
05:51:04.548 --> 05:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
but could have been applied in another
 
05:51:07.670 --> 05:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
situation would you agree with that
 
05:51:09.510 --> 05:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
well it was actually the site evaluation
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
rules have been around for quite some
 
05:51:12.070 --> 05:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
time right
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
back before the first wind project was
 
05:51:14.558 --> 05:51:15.670 align:start position:0%
back before the first wind project was
uh

05:51:15.670 --> 05:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
planned for new hampshire
 
05:51:19.910 --> 05:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
what has happened is the of the
 
05:51:22.948 --> 05:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
committee and rightfully so has learned
 
05:51:24.788 --> 05:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
through the project the first one they
 
05:51:24.798 --> 05:51:26.390 align:start position:0%
through the project the first one they
had

05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
had
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
was a 24 i think was a 24 megawatt
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
system in the southwest portion of the
 
05:51:30.798 --> 05:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
system in the southwest portion of the
state

05:51:31.670 --> 05:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then we've had a couple of other
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
ones since then and the laws were
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
changed to reflect on some of the
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
lessons learned during those hearings
 
05:51:41.590 --> 05:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
but there was a hearing process and
 
05:51:43.430 --> 05:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
there was rules that governed how those
 
05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
hearings were tell it's just that
 
05:51:47.110 --> 05:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
because of what we learned during those
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
things it was decided to say well we
 
05:51:50.948 --> 05:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
need to beef up the laws a little bit
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
more specifically to address wind
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
but it could be done for any type of
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
project like that i mean hopefully we
 
05:52:04.070 --> 05:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:05.670 --> 05:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay did you need a follow-up
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative follow the follow-up
 
05:52:09.990 --> 05:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
would have been for me could you make
 
05:52:12.230 --> 05:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
the laws retroactively in other words
 
05:52:14.868 --> 05:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
the project is approved and the the
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
project is going on and there are
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
certain specifications for any project
 
05:52:20.788 --> 05:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
could you then
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
say wait a minute
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
we got to make rules now
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:34.708 --> 05:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
if a project is approved
 
05:52:37.110 --> 05:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
and then next year you said wait a
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
minute but this rule
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
you have to you have to follow this rule
 
05:52:43.750 --> 05:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
or this law you can't do that
 
05:52:43.760 --> 05:52:45.270 align:start position:0%
or this law you can't do that
retroactively

05:52:45.270 --> 05:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
so in order for something to go ahead
 
05:52:50.430 --> 05:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
they would have had to make
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
specifications and then send them on to
 
05:52:53.120 --> 05:52:55.430 align:start position:0%
specifications and then send them on to
jalka

05:52:55.430 --> 05:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
jalka
 
05:52:56.788 --> 05:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
that's what i would call it a
 
05:52:56.798 --> 05:52:58.548 align:start position:0%
that's what i would call it a
specification

05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
specification
 
05:52:59.910 --> 05:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
because one of them
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
my in my mind when we visited those one
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the major concerns was what happens
 
05:53:06.788 --> 05:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
when this tower
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
no longer functional
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
and in that is one of the things that
 
05:53:12.948 --> 05:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
was added to the law which is required
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
for decommissioning the retroactive laws
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
are generally uh looked on as
 
05:53:18.390 --> 05:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
non-constitutional certainly i wouldn't
 
05:53:20.470 --> 05:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
approve of giving somebody approval and
 
05:53:22.150 --> 05:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
then passing the law a couple years
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
later saying you have to uh have to
 
05:53:25.990 --> 05:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
change the way you built it unless there
 
05:53:28.230 --> 05:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
was a you know a real new safety issue
 
05:53:29.990 --> 05:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
or something like that that came up but
 
05:53:32.470 --> 05:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
this this build again it doesn't affect
 
05:53:34.948 --> 05:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
any specific project whatsoever it's not
 
05:53:38.070 --> 05:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
going to make anybody
 
05:53:41.190 --> 05:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
undo anything it just simply says make
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
the rules match the law
 
05:53:45.670 --> 05:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so if a plant if there's a facility
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
out there that decides they want to have
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
an emergency response plan there's
 
05:53:50.470 --> 05:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
nothing that stops them from having it
 
05:53:52.150 --> 05:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
they just don't have to have one under
 
05:53:54.070 --> 05:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
the force of law because the law doesn't
 
05:53:56.708 --> 05:53:56.718 align:start position:0%
require that it's not in the law
 
05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
and if you have a solar facility and you
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
want to put in a do a sound assessment
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
you can sound assess all you want it's
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
just not required by the law so this
 
05:54:07.030 --> 05:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't undo anything it's not
 
05:54:07.040 --> 05:54:08.708 align:start position:0%
doesn't undo anything it's not
retroactive

05:54:08.708 --> 05:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
it just says make the law the rules
 
05:54:16.230 --> 05:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.240 --> 05:54:17.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:54:17.590 --> 05:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:54:20.548 --> 05:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
uh representative creation uh
 
05:54:21.510 --> 05:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
is this your second or third question
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:29.670 --> 05:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair again um thank you for
 
05:54:31.990 --> 05:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
your indulgence um
 
05:54:33.910 --> 05:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess getting back to that question
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
of whether
 
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
these rules are meant sorry uh very
 
05:54:41.910 --> 05:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
specifically in section 162 h16
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
it mentions
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation for for sites and facilities
 
05:54:48.310 --> 05:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
generally that the responsibility of the
 
05:54:48.320 --> 05:54:49.350 align:start position:0%
generally that the responsibility of the
sec

05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
sec
 
05:54:51.190 --> 05:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
is to check whether
 
05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
the facility will have an unreasonable
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
adverse effect on aesthetics historic
 
05:54:56.470 --> 05:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
sites etc
 
05:54:56.480 --> 05:54:57.750 align:start position:0%
sites etc
um

05:54:57.750 --> 05:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:59.510 --> 05:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding your position
 
05:55:01.830 --> 05:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
correctly you seem to be saying that if
 
05:55:03.110 --> 05:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:55:05.110 --> 05:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
if we're not being or sorry if we
 
05:55:07.030 --> 05:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
haven't laid out in an rsa for a very
 
05:55:07.040 --> 05:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
haven't laid out in an rsa for a very
specific

05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:55:10.470 --> 05:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
type of plants that
 
05:55:12.868 --> 05:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
we have to make rules for for xyz that
 
05:55:12.878 --> 05:55:13.750 align:start position:0%
we have to make rules for for xyz that
they

05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:55:15.750 --> 05:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
cannot um
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
evaluate that
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
i guess how do you see that as
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with 162 h16 well again it
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't this would not change the
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
section of the law that you just read
 
05:55:27.590 --> 05:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's simply you have to understand how
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
the process worked here this wasn't a
 
05:55:31.590 --> 05:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
a thing where somebody went up and said
 
05:55:33.670 --> 05:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
let's make a rule up that it will it'll
 
05:55:33.680 --> 05:55:34.390 align:start position:0%
let's make a rule up that it will it'll
do

05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh or a law that'll that'll cover all
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
plan all types of energy facilities
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
there are requirements in the law that
 
05:55:42.310 --> 05:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
do affect all types of energy facilities
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
but the most of these changes were
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
specifically to wind plants wind
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
facilities and they were written as a
 
05:55:50.548 --> 05:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
direct result what was learned in the
 
05:55:52.390 --> 05:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
previous hearings and they were put in
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
to address when there was no question
 
05:55:56.070 --> 05:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
about it that's what the law the intent
 
05:55:58.708 --> 05:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
of the law was that which is in the law
 
05:56:00.708 --> 05:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
now if they wanted the site evaluation
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee said well that's such a good
 
05:56:04.868 --> 05:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
idea we think it should apply to all
 
05:56:06.390 --> 05:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
types of plants then they should have
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature and
 
05:56:10.628 --> 05:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
requested that they broaden the scope of
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
the law so that all energy facilities
 
05:56:14.788 --> 05:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
require that when you have a paragraph
 
05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's simply strictly on wind only and
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
you list a series of requirements the
 
05:56:21.430 --> 05:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the law is that they apply to
 
05:56:23.430 --> 05:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
the wind and not to the other types of
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
facilities or they would have been
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
covered in the other sections of the of
 
05:56:30.868 --> 05:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:32.470 --> 05:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
may i just fall out i guess my
 
05:56:34.470 --> 05:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of h16 is that they do
 
05:56:36.788 --> 05:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
apply to all these other
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
types what would what i don't have like
 
05:56:39.910 --> 05:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
i said i don't have it memorized
 
05:56:42.788 --> 05:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
whatever you read on h16 would apply to
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
all types that is correct yes because
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's it doesn't say wind only okay well
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
then aesthetics
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
and environment are covered thank you
 
05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:11.430 --> 05:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative man next time you ask a
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
question please turn on your mic oh
 
05:57:14.548 --> 05:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
05:57:16.150 --> 05:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i was wondering couldn't the rule
 
05:57:18.150 --> 05:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
be justified by
 
05:57:21.190 --> 05:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
some law that isn't specific to wind or
 
05:57:21.200 --> 05:57:22.948 align:start position:0%
some law that isn't specific to wind or
to

05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh new facilities but rather um
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
more generals applying to just in
 
05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
electric supply a safety
 
05:57:32.470 --> 05:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
issue or something like that in other
 
05:57:32.480 --> 05:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
issue or something like that in other
words

05:57:33.430 --> 05:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
words
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
when you say these things are not there
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
might be a rule that is not supported by
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
law how far back
 
05:57:45.190 --> 05:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
can you go in the law to look for some
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
justification for
 
05:57:48.948 --> 05:57:48.958 align:start position:0%
that rule
 
05:57:48.958 --> 05:57:50.150 align:start position:0%
that rule
well

05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:57:51.670 --> 05:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:57:53.590 --> 05:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
and in this case it was it was pretty
 
05:57:56.230 --> 05:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
easy to do because the legislature
 
05:57:59.350 --> 05:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
passed a major change to 162h
 
05:58:01.910 --> 05:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
and they specifically to address wind
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
facilities that was the major change
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
that was done and as a direct result of
 
05:58:08.548 --> 05:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
that new rules were written and they
 
05:58:10.230 --> 05:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
were written as in most laws say you
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
know the site evaluation committee will
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
write rules to implement this law and
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
they did specifically to implement that
 
05:58:18.390 --> 05:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
change to the law so it's pretty easy to
 
05:58:19.590 --> 05:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
say that
 
05:58:21.510 --> 05:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
the rules should be reflecting what was
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
changed in the law now as far as going
 
05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
back or more general things i don't
 
05:58:27.270 --> 05:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
think you have to do it in this case
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
because we know specifically why the
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
rules were being changed they were
 
05:58:36.150 --> 05:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:38.150 --> 05:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up representative
 
05:58:39.990 --> 05:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
man okay don't forget to turn off your
 
05:58:40.000 --> 05:58:40.948 align:start position:0%
man okay don't forget to turn off your
mic

05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
mic
 
05:58:40.958 --> 05:58:42.948 align:start position:0%
mic
um

05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:44.470 --> 05:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for
 
05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you representative
 
05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
harrington for
 
05:58:52.830 --> 05:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
presenting your bill and
 
05:58:55.270 --> 05:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
testifying it
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i will now call our next
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
presenter on this subject
 
05:59:03.270 --> 05:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that is lori lerner
 
05:59:05.990 --> 05:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
who hails from bridgewater
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and she's here
 
05:59:09.190 --> 05:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
representing herself
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
and she opposes this bill
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:14.558 --> 05:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for the
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today in opposition
 
06:00:10.628 --> 06:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
to this bill 1611. i was the president
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire win watch and actively
 
06:00:14.548 --> 06:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
involved during the time of significant
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
procedural changes to the site
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee the statute and the
 
06:00:21.270 --> 06:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
rules and that was guided by senate bill
 
06:00:25.750 --> 06:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
99 senate bill 281 and senate bill 245.
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
that was a culmination of efforts
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
between a a lot of public
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
involvement sp 99 and 245
 
06:00:35.830 --> 06:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
were not specific to any particular
 
06:00:37.750 --> 06:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
energy type facility
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
sb 281 was specific to industrial wind
 
06:00:43.270 --> 06:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
these bills were enacted in an effort to
 
06:00:45.190 --> 06:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
restore the public trust in the sec
 
06:00:47.110 --> 06:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
process and to provide for greater
 
06:00:49.030 --> 06:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
public transport transparency and
 
06:00:49.040 --> 06:00:50.708 align:start position:0%
public transport transparency and
involvement

06:00:50.708 --> 06:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
that process consisted of
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
a very large statewide effort to get a
 
06:00:58.390 --> 06:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
survey of people
 
06:01:00.310 --> 06:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
from there we went to a pre-rule-making
 
06:01:00.320 --> 06:01:01.350 align:start position:0%
from there we went to a pre-rule-making
effort

06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
effort
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
and again that was considering all types
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
of energy facilities from there we
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
drilled into that
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
to a rule-making process
 
06:01:12.230 --> 06:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then it went on to the adoption of
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1611 recommends a review of the sec
 
06:01:19.190 --> 06:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
rules based on a misguided assertion the
 
06:01:20.548 --> 06:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
rules were adopted that were not
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by rsa 162h
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
i strongly disagree with this assertion
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
first item was the adjudicative hearing
 
06:01:31.590 --> 06:01:31.600 align:start position:0%

06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
facility is proposed and on it goes
 
06:02:07.350 --> 06:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
additionally rsa 162 h10
 
06:02:07.360 --> 06:02:09.030 align:start position:0%

06:02:10.948 --> 06:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
subsequent public hearings shall be in
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
the nature of adjudicative proceedings
 
06:02:14.590 --> 06:02:14.600 align:start position:0%

06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
for this reason i do believe that the
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
rules correspond to our statute moving
 
06:02:23.350 --> 06:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
on to visual impact assessment there's
 
06:02:25.990 --> 06:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
corresponding authority within 162h
 
06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
which applies to all energy facilities
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
in the declaration of purpose it states
 
06:02:32.788 --> 06:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
the legislature recognizes the selection
 
06:02:34.948 --> 06:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
of sites for energy facilities may have
 
06:02:37.430 --> 06:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
significant impacts on and benefits to
 
06:02:38.628 --> 06:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
the following
 
06:02:41.190 --> 06:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
and one of those is aesthetics within
 
06:02:44.070 --> 06:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
the application for certificate section
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
it requires the energy facility to
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
provide such additional information as
 
06:02:49.750 --> 06:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
the committee may require to carry out
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
and this chapter continues on with the
 
06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
findings and certificate issuance and
 
06:02:57.670 --> 06:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
within that
 
06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
it states the science facility will not
 
06:03:01.510 --> 06:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
have an unreasonable adverse effect on
 
06:03:01.520 --> 06:03:02.708 align:start position:0%
have an unreasonable adverse effect on
aesthetics

06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
aesthetics
 
06:03:04.548 --> 06:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
some additional background
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
senate bill 99 directed the office of
 
06:03:08.708 --> 06:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
energy and planning to conduct public
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholder pre-rule making process to
 
06:03:13.430 --> 06:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
help develop regulatory criteria for the
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
siting of energy facilities
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
to inform an sec rulemaking process
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
as a result of the rule making on page
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
four of the document where the footnote
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
is it specifically states general
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
agreement was reached by a group that
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
some level of visual impact analysis
 
06:03:31.190 --> 06:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
should be required for all proposed
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and the rules should allow
 
06:03:35.590 --> 06:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the level of the via
 
06:03:37.830 --> 06:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
based on the type and level of impact
 
06:03:39.990 --> 06:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is precisely what has been defined
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
by rule 301.05
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
effect on aesthetics
 
06:03:47.270 --> 06:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next item
 
06:03:49.030 --> 06:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
sound assessment and fire protection
 
06:03:49.040 --> 06:03:50.390 align:start position:0%
sound assessment and fire protection
plan

06:03:50.390 --> 06:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
plan
 
06:03:51.670 --> 06:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
first of all there's an erroneous
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
reference it references section c
 
06:03:55.190 --> 06:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
instead of d
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
but overlooking that within the
 
06:03:59.190 --> 06:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
declaration of purpose
 
06:04:00.788 --> 06:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
there's a statement of the statement
 
06:04:03.350 --> 06:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
goes on the legislature can recognizes
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
the selection of sites for energy
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
facilities may have significant impacts
 
06:04:09.670 --> 06:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
on the on and benefits to the following
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
and one of those items is public health
 
06:04:13.590 --> 06:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
06:04:13.600 --> 06:04:15.190 align:start position:0%
and safety
again

06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
application for certificate specifically
 
06:04:18.868 --> 06:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
states provides such additional
 
06:04:20.548 --> 06:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
information as the committee may require
 
06:04:22.948 --> 06:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
to carry out purposes of this chapter
 
06:04:24.470 --> 06:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
in the findings
 
06:04:25.990 --> 06:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
it must be determined the site and
 
06:04:27.750 --> 06:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
facility will not have an unreasonable
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
adverse on public health and safety
 
06:04:30.878 --> 06:04:33.628 align:start position:0%
adverse on public health and safety
additionally

06:04:33.628 --> 06:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
301.081 states accept as otherwise
 
06:04:36.240 --> 06:04:37.350 align:start position:0%
301.081 states accept as otherwise
provided

06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
provided
 
06:04:39.510 --> 06:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
in a1 above an assessment of the
 
06:04:41.590 --> 06:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
operational sound associated with the
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
proposed facility if the facility would
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
involve the use of equipment it might
 
06:04:47.350 --> 06:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
reasonably be expected to increase sound
 
06:04:49.830 --> 06:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
by 10 decibel
 
06:04:52.150 --> 06:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
measured at the l 90 sound level this
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
was incorporated to make sure there was
 
06:04:56.708 --> 06:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
no public health or safety concern over
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
any particular noise from any type of
 
06:05:02.070 --> 06:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
energy energy facility
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
so again it should be noted it's only
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
required if it would introduce excess of
 
06:05:08.548 --> 06:05:08.558 align:start position:0%
10 dba above background levels this
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
would apply to a substation used for any
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
facility and any other facility which
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
will potentially introduce excessive
 
06:05:16.788 --> 06:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
sound emissions
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
a fire protection plan is relevant for
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
all energy facilities included but not
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
limited to transmission lines in light
 
06:05:24.708 --> 06:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the known wildfire hazards
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
experienced in the forest and in brush
 
06:05:27.360 --> 06:05:28.868 align:start position:0%
experienced in the forest and in brush
areas

06:05:28.868 --> 06:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
areas
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
the emergency response plan much as
 
06:05:30.958 --> 06:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
the emergency response plan much as
above

06:05:32.390 --> 06:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
above
 
06:05:34.390 --> 06:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
has the same statutory authority as
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
described in the sound assessment and
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
fire protection plan an emergency
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
response plan is relevant for the same
 
06:05:41.830 --> 06:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
reasons specified for the fire
 
06:05:44.470 --> 06:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
protection plan which is for the event
 
06:05:44.480 --> 06:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
protection plan which is for the event
of

06:05:45.590 --> 06:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
a forest fire a brush fire or any other
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
type of fire
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion for the reasons identified
 
06:05:52.948 --> 06:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
above i disagree with the assertion the
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
statutory authority was exceeded and
 
06:05:58.470 --> 06:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill be itled
 
06:06:00.868 --> 06:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that excellent
 
06:06:04.708 --> 06:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
testimony i appreciate that
 
06:06:06.788 --> 06:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
do we have questions for ms lerner
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative platt has a question
 
06:06:10.628 --> 06:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:06:14.310 --> 06:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you're right
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
and this law passes
 
06:06:17.910 --> 06:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't the result be the site
 
06:06:19.750 --> 06:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee going through every
 
06:06:21.510 --> 06:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of its rules and saying it this is
 
06:06:23.670 --> 06:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
how it's tied to law with no change in
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:28.150 --> 06:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question correctly
 
06:06:30.150 --> 06:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
i strongly believe that everything in
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
the rules was tied directly back to the
 
06:06:32.320 --> 06:06:34.310 align:start position:0%
the rules was tied directly back to the
statute

06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
my question was wouldn't they find that
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
then going through the rules yes yes yes
 
06:06:41.350 --> 06:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
they would in a trace back through the
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
complete sb99 281 and 245 process
 
06:06:48.070 --> 06:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
through the sb pre-rule-making and onto
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:53.360 --> 06:06:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:06:54.470 --> 06:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions for ms lerner
 
06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
if i can just add one thing
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
so this this was a bit of an
 
06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstance given the
 
06:07:06.548 --> 06:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
times that we were faced with between
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
northern pass and industrial wind
 
06:07:12.230 --> 06:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
coming down within our state and at that
 
06:07:14.230 --> 06:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
time there was a huge eruption of public
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
interest in all of this
 
06:07:18.310 --> 06:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
and so the there was no way that the
 
06:07:21.750 --> 06:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislature could outline in the statute
 
06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
every single specific change which is
 
06:07:25.830 --> 06:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
why there was a lot of
 
06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
time and effort spent hiring outside
 
06:07:31.830 --> 06:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
experts to help with this entire process
 
06:07:34.470 --> 06:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
and i strongly believe that it follows
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
06:07:38.150 --> 06:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the intent of it
 
06:07:38.160 --> 06:07:39.350 align:start position:0%
in the intent of it
and

06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:41.430 --> 06:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
everything can be traced back to that
 
06:07:44.788 --> 06:07:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:46.628 --> 06:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question if someone else
 
06:07:49.200 --> 06:07:51.670 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question if someone else
does

06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:58.868 --> 06:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
nature of sec projects which are very
 
06:08:02.310 --> 06:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
legalistic in that they examine
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
in minute detail
 
06:08:06.548 --> 06:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements and rules
 
06:08:06.558 --> 06:08:08.628 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements and rules
requirements

06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:08:11.590 --> 06:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
and apply them to
 
06:08:15.910 --> 06:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the result
 
06:08:20.070 --> 06:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
be litigation
 
06:08:20.080 --> 06:08:21.270 align:start position:0%
be litigation
if

06:08:21.270 --> 06:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
a project
 
06:08:25.910 --> 06:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
if a project developer determined
 
06:08:25.920 --> 06:08:27.030 align:start position:0%
if a project developer determined
that

06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:08:31.030 --> 06:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
the rules as written didn't match
 
06:08:32.310 --> 06:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
06:08:34.150 --> 06:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
that authorized those rules wouldn't
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
there be likely be litigation that would
 
06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
happen and has any such litigation
 
06:08:41.430 --> 06:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
happened with regard to sec rules i'm
 
06:08:43.830 --> 06:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
not familiar with any litigation i will
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
also say that the stakeholder process
 
06:08:46.240 --> 06:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
also say that the stakeholder process
included

06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
included
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
participants from industry so we had
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
participants from eversource unitil
 
06:08:56.788 --> 06:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
industrial wind facilities
 
06:08:58.948 --> 06:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
every type of facility was represented
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
on on the scc rulemaking process and
 
06:09:03.270 --> 06:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
then on to the rule making process so
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of feedback and input
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
that went through to develop these rules
 
06:09:13.430 --> 06:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:16.150 --> 06:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for ms lerner i
 
06:09:19.110 --> 06:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
will now move on to our next presenter
 
06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that is lisa knows of lyman new
 
06:09:24.390 --> 06:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire who's here to represent
 
06:09:24.400 --> 06:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
hampshire who's here to represent
herself

06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
herself
 
06:09:28.390 --> 06:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
ms leno's thank you nice to see you
 
06:09:28.400 --> 06:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
ms leno's thank you nice to see you
again

06:09:45.110 --> 06:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:47.510 --> 06:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair vice chair thomas and
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
06:09:51.270 --> 06:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is lisa linos i'm
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
a resident of the state of new hampshire
 
06:09:54.708 --> 06:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
i have appeared as an intervenor before
 
06:09:56.548 --> 06:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee numerous
 
06:10:00.310 --> 06:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
times and also as an expert witness
 
06:10:04.708 --> 06:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:07.270 --> 06:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
the i do i am speaking in opposition to
 
06:10:07.280 --> 06:10:08.868 align:start position:0%
the i do i am speaking in opposition to
1161.

06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
1161.
 
06:10:09.948 --> 06:10:09.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:10:14.390 --> 06:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
1611. that's a typo my the premise is uh
 
06:10:16.548 --> 06:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
ms lerner stated it appears to be that
 
06:10:19.750 --> 06:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
the sec has exceeded its authority in
 
06:10:21.830 --> 06:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
adopting certain rules
 
06:10:24.708 --> 06:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
and um i have two
 
06:10:26.470 --> 06:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
main points i want to make i won't get
 
06:10:29.590 --> 06:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
into the details as to what um
 
06:10:32.230 --> 06:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
the bill says but i will speak to the
 
06:10:35.110 --> 06:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
fact that everything that has been
 
06:10:36.868 --> 06:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
stated as potentially exceeding the
 
06:10:38.708 --> 06:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
authority of the sec in fact is
 
06:10:41.750 --> 06:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
supported by 162h
 
06:10:44.230 --> 06:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
so during the rulemaking process this
 
06:10:46.430 --> 06:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
would be an sec docket
 
06:10:49.070 --> 06:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
201404 so it happened over the
 
06:10:51.270 --> 06:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
2014-2015 time frame
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
the rules show that the sec was very
 
06:10:55.350 --> 06:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
careful to ensure it followed the
 
06:10:58.070 --> 06:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
explicit language of 162h
 
06:11:00.390 --> 06:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
in areas where the language was not
 
06:11:03.030 --> 06:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
specific the sec
 
06:11:05.190 --> 06:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
assessed and showed where its actions
 
06:11:06.868 --> 06:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
were consistent with legisl the
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
legislative intent under sb 245. that's
 
06:11:12.470 --> 06:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
a critical component there and i'll come
 
06:11:14.390 --> 06:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
back to that in a moment
 
06:11:16.310 --> 06:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
so my the first point i wanted to make
 
06:11:18.628 --> 06:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
and miss leonard lerner mention it but i
 
06:11:20.788 --> 06:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize it
 
06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
um hb 16 take 11 16 11 takes objection
 
06:11:27.670 --> 06:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
to the fact that an applicant who
 
06:11:29.990 --> 06:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
chooses to have or wishes to have his
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
application exempt it from the sec
 
06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
process in 162h
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
the sec rules state that an adjudicative
 
06:11:41.190 --> 06:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearing has to be conducted
 
06:11:44.708 --> 06:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
this state the legislature i'm sorry 162
 
06:11:44.718 --> 06:11:45.670 align:start position:0%
this state the legislature i'm sorry 162
h

06:11:45.670 --> 06:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
h
 
06:11:46.868 --> 06:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
the law
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
this would be colon 4
 
06:11:52.948 --> 06:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
says that a public hearing will be held
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it appears that representative
 
06:11:55.440 --> 06:11:56.868 align:start position:0%
and it appears that representative
harrington

06:11:56.868 --> 06:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
has said that a public hearing
 
06:12:00.868 --> 06:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
it does not necessarily imply an
 
06:12:03.190 --> 06:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearing okay
 
06:12:03.200 --> 06:12:04.390 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearing okay
but

06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:12:07.910 --> 06:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
under rsa 162 h10
 
06:12:10.230 --> 06:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
which is titled
 
06:12:13.110 --> 06:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
public hearings public hearing studies
 
06:12:14.628 --> 06:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
and rules
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
it establishes for the sec
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the only time the committee will
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
conduct a public hearing that is
 
06:12:21.440 --> 06:12:23.270 align:start position:0%
conduct a public hearing that is
non-adjudicative

06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
non-adjudicative
 
06:12:25.990 --> 06:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
is when it is holding a joint meeting
 
06:12:28.390 --> 06:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
after an application has been accepted
 
06:12:30.390 --> 06:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it's the joint meeting is between
 
06:12:33.430 --> 06:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
the agencies and the sec
 
06:12:35.110 --> 06:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
at a public meeting
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
at a public hearing before the public in
 
06:12:39.910 --> 06:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
the county in which the application
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
application is proposed to be cited
 
06:12:44.070 --> 06:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
it all it says
 
06:12:46.230 --> 06:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
all subsequent
 
06:12:48.628 --> 06:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
hearings public hearings of the
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee are to be adjudicated hearings
 
06:12:53.430 --> 06:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's it it doesn't show and they're
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
only there are no other public hearings
 
06:12:59.430 --> 06:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
that are not declared as adjudicative
 
06:13:01.830 --> 06:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the language of 162h may
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
be confusing there because it doesn't
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
really consider out-of-order
 
06:13:08.948 --> 06:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
applications in this case and in a case
 
06:13:10.788 --> 06:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
where an applicant is petitioning to
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
have his application exempt from the sec
 
06:13:13.920 --> 06:13:14.948 align:start position:0%
have his application exempt from the sec
process

06:13:14.948 --> 06:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:13:17.430 --> 06:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
he comes in files the petition
 
06:13:20.390 --> 06:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then says that i i you know can you
 
06:13:20.400 --> 06:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
and then says that i i you know can you
take

06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
take
 
06:13:23.670 --> 06:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is the sec will hold an
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
adjudicated hearing to make a
 
06:13:25.360 --> 06:13:27.270 align:start position:0%
adjudicated hearing to make a
determination

06:13:27.270 --> 06:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
determination
 
06:13:30.548 --> 06:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
again it doesn't explicitly say in 162h
 
06:13:32.708 --> 06:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
that in that case it's an adjudicative
 
06:13:32.718 --> 06:13:33.670 align:start position:0%
that in that case it's an adjudicative
hearing

06:13:33.670 --> 06:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:13:36.150 --> 06:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
what it says is in that case it's a
 
06:13:39.030 --> 06:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing elsewhere in the law it
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
says all public hearings but for the
 
06:13:44.310 --> 06:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
informational hearing that occurs but
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing that occurs
 
06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
fully judicial process all public
 
06:13:52.788 --> 06:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
hearings will be adjudicative
 
06:13:55.110 --> 06:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
so you may want to make an adjustment to
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
language on 162h there but that is
 
06:14:00.150 --> 06:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
clearly where the sec is coming from
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
when it is following an adjudicative
 
06:14:04.948 --> 06:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
with regard to legislative intent on
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
that point 160 sb 245 made an explicit
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
change to the law
 
06:14:16.390 --> 06:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
prior to sb245 passing
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
the law had said
 
06:14:22.628 --> 06:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
that the sec will only hold a public
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
information hearing to determine whether
 
06:14:27.750 --> 06:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
or not an application can be exempted it
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
explicitly changed as the legislature
 
06:14:33.270 --> 06:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly change the language from a
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
public information hearing to determine
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
exemption to a public hearing
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make that point there
 
06:14:42.548 --> 06:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
there was a change by the legislature
 
06:14:43.670 --> 06:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
06:14:45.750 --> 06:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
appears clear
 
06:14:49.350 --> 06:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
with regard to sections 2 b c and d in
 
06:14:49.360 --> 06:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
with regard to sections 2 b c and d in
1611

06:14:51.030 --> 06:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
1611
 
06:14:52.708 --> 06:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
i would like to draw your attention to a
 
06:14:57.670 --> 06:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
november 25th 2015 letter that sec chair
 
06:14:59.910 --> 06:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
martin horningberg sent to jail car this
 
06:15:01.110 --> 06:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
is when
 
06:15:03.990 --> 06:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
we were the the process had been coming
 
06:15:05.430 --> 06:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
to a close
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
and uh the first draft rules or proposal
 
06:15:11.990 --> 06:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
had been sent that were deemed to be
 
06:15:14.230 --> 06:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
final believed to be final were sent to
 
06:15:16.628 --> 06:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
jail car and jail car issued a
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection to the 2015 final
 
06:15:21.110 --> 06:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
rule proposal
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
and in that case djokar's concern was
 
06:15:25.990 --> 06:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
that the sec had exceeded its authority
 
06:15:27.430 --> 06:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
when it defined
 
06:15:29.830 --> 06:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
definition of public use criteria
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
because the new law under sb245 it said
 
06:15:35.030 --> 06:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
that the project had to show
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be in the public interests
 
06:15:40.390 --> 06:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm so now public use probably be in
 
06:15:42.548 --> 06:15:42.558 align:start position:0%
the public interest the sec through the
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process had to find what it
 
06:15:46.788 --> 06:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
meant to be in the public interest
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
jail car objective
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
so chairman oneenberg's response to joe
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
carr which is this is i could send you
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
the link uh chairman bose to this letter
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
but it's right on the sec website
 
06:16:01.590 --> 06:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
his response to jail card addressed the
 
06:16:03.590 --> 06:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
immediate concern regarding the public
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
interest question and he also added this
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
statement which responds directly to the
 
06:16:10.868 --> 06:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
issues raised by 11 by 16 11.
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
and this is quote we note further that
 
06:16:16.628 --> 06:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
sb 245 in addition to requiring the sec
 
06:16:18.548 --> 06:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
fine the issuance of a certificate will
 
06:16:20.470 --> 06:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
serve the public interest
 
06:16:24.868 --> 06:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
also amended rsa 162 h16
 
06:16:27.190 --> 06:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
to include the following sentence
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
after due consideration in this
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
descendants after due consideration of
 
06:16:33.510 --> 06:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
all relevant information regarding the
 
06:16:35.350 --> 06:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
potential sighting or roots of a
 
06:16:37.830 --> 06:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
proposed energy facility including
 
06:16:39.510 --> 06:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
potential significant impacts and
 
06:16:41.670 --> 06:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
benefits the site evaluation committee
 
06:16:43.350 --> 06:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
shall determine if issuance of a
 
06:16:45.110 --> 06:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
certificate will serve the objectives of
 
06:16:46.948 --> 06:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
if you look at footnote in in the
 
06:16:51.590 --> 06:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
document i handed you the footnote
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
below shows what the original wording
 
06:16:56.628 --> 06:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
was before sb 245 is written so the all
 
06:16:59.910 --> 06:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
relevant information is important
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
then he goes on to say sb 245 also
 
06:17:06.150 --> 06:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
amended the sec rulemaking mandate in
 
06:17:10.868 --> 06:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
rsa 162 h10 7 to require that the sec
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
adopt rules relative to the criteria for
 
06:17:16.390 --> 06:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
citing energy facilities including
 
06:17:18.470 --> 06:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
specific criteria to be applied in
 
06:17:20.470 --> 06:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
determining if the requirements of rsa
 
06:17:23.510 --> 06:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
162h have been met by the applicant for
 
06:17:26.150 --> 06:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
the certificate of site and facility
 
06:17:28.708 --> 06:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
notably he goes on this amendment
 
06:17:30.788 --> 06:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
brought in the scope of the rulemaking
 
06:17:33.990 --> 06:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
directive to adopt specific criteria to
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
encompass all of rsa 162 h16s
 
06:17:40.470 --> 06:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
including the public interest finding
 
06:17:42.548 --> 06:17:42.558 align:start position:0%
that's what i believe representative
 
06:17:45.030 --> 06:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
harrington is missing it was there were
 
06:17:46.788 --> 06:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
two laws
 
06:17:49.270 --> 06:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
s two bills sb
 
06:17:53.510 --> 06:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
sp 245 required rulemaking be introduced
 
06:17:55.350 --> 06:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
and open and they expanded the
 
06:17:57.270 --> 06:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking requirement
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
sb 281 was an additional law that said
 
06:18:02.788 --> 06:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
oh in addition to these rules we want to
 
06:18:04.708 --> 06:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
make sure you don't forget about the win
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
question and then it articulated some of
 
06:18:09.430 --> 06:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
the concerned concerns of a win
 
06:18:11.590 --> 06:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that what was applied
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
for win was not to apply that they were
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
forbidden to apply those similar kinds
 
06:18:21.030 --> 06:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
of uh criteria to other applications it
 
06:18:23.910 --> 06:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
was the other way around 245 came first
 
06:18:26.230 --> 06:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
281 came later
 
06:18:28.390 --> 06:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
although they were
 
06:18:30.708 --> 06:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
filed around the same time in other i
 
06:18:32.868 --> 06:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
rather it could come much later but the
 
06:18:34.150 --> 06:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
same year
 
06:18:36.150 --> 06:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
in other words the legislative intent
 
06:18:38.948 --> 06:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
intent of sb 245 is interpreted by the
 
06:18:38.958 --> 06:18:40.070 align:start position:0%
intent of sb 245 is interpreted by the
sec

06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
sec
 
06:18:42.468 --> 06:18:42.478 align:start position:0%
and accepted by gel card this letter was
 
06:18:44.230 --> 06:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
sent to gel card gel card didn't turn
 
06:18:46.868 --> 06:18:46.878 align:start position:0%
around and said no you misread at 245's
 
06:18:46.878 --> 06:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
around and said no you misread at 245's
intent

06:18:48.070 --> 06:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
intent
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
jail card accepted this sentence
 
06:18:51.360 --> 06:18:52.150 align:start position:0%
jail card accepted this sentence
and

06:18:52.150 --> 06:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
the this interpretation
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
of legislative intent was for the sec to
 
06:18:59.830 --> 06:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
develop specific criteria for all energy
 
06:19:01.750 --> 06:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
facilities when making a finding of no
 
06:19:03.910 --> 06:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable adverse effects
 
06:19:06.070 --> 06:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
contrary to the claims of
 
06:19:09.510 --> 06:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
hb 1611 the sec acted properly it
 
06:19:11.990 --> 06:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
appears hb 1611 fails to fully
 
06:19:13.670 --> 06:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
understand the existing language and
 
06:19:16.468 --> 06:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
authorities of the sec as granted with
 
06:19:19.110 --> 06:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
the passage of sbg45
 
06:19:20.948 --> 06:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
and i encourage this committee to oppose
 
06:19:26.150 --> 06:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:29.590 --> 06:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that testimony
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh ms lerner now we're going to find out
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
if the committee
 
06:19:36.868 --> 06:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
has any specific questions for you about
 
06:19:41.110 --> 06:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:43.910 --> 06:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it would appear that nobody does
 
06:19:45.510 --> 06:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
i do have a question
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
could you
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
help refresh our memory as to exactly
 
06:19:49.440 --> 06:19:51.190 align:start position:0%
help refresh our memory as to exactly
when

06:19:51.190 --> 06:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
the bills that you mentioned
 
06:19:58.708 --> 06:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
sb 245 sb 99 and sb 281
 
06:20:01.270 --> 06:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
win those bills what what legislative
 
06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
i i believe that was 2014. i it may have
 
06:20:14.628 --> 06:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
been introduced in 2013 but adopted in
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
2014 as part of the 2013-14 and 281
 
06:20:22.868 --> 06:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
281 i'm going to ask lori lerner that
 
06:20:30.390 --> 06:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
so the year was 2014 for both of those
 
06:20:36.390 --> 06:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
bills how about senate bill 99
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:47.990 --> 06:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative notter is recognized for
 
06:20:51.910 --> 06:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
a question thank you i'm just going back
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
in my head do you remember who the
 
06:20:56.548 --> 06:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
chairman was that year
 
06:21:00.070 --> 06:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
there was a woman from the east uh
 
06:21:10.548 --> 06:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
coastal area and i'm
 
06:21:13.030 --> 06:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
that ultimately was involved with 245
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
when that passed and i don't remember
 
06:21:15.990 --> 06:21:16.000 align:start position:0%

06:22:00.628 --> 06:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
received it yes and i will amend it so
 
06:22:02.390 --> 06:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
it includes the link to
 
06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
chairman honenberg's letter so that you
 
06:22:06.468 --> 06:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
can see that excellent thank you thank
 
06:22:09.030 --> 06:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
you it went several rounds to jail clerk
 
06:22:10.948 --> 06:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
i mean this was controversial the entire
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
process was controversial and gelcar
 
06:22:14.468 --> 06:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
went around
 
06:22:17.510 --> 06:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
at least two or three rounds
 
06:22:19.110 --> 06:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman if i may add when the
 
06:22:21.030 --> 06:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
question was asked if this bill passed
 
06:22:22.708 --> 06:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
what's the problem they're all they're
 
06:22:24.628 --> 06:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
going to find the same outcome that
 
06:22:26.548 --> 06:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about it's a question of
 
06:22:29.590 --> 06:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
time and wasting time that's a worry and
 
06:22:31.750 --> 06:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's already been done it's been in
 
06:22:34.948 --> 06:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
place for since 20 december 2015 was
 
06:22:36.628 --> 06:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
when the rules were adopted
 
06:22:36.638 --> 06:22:37.510 align:start position:0%
when the rules were adopted
okay

06:22:37.510 --> 06:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:22:42.628 --> 06:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
any further questions for ms lerner
 
06:22:45.750 --> 06:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
or miss uh leno's rather either of them
 
06:22:47.830 --> 06:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
06:22:49.830 --> 06:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you both for your
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and we'll move on to our
 
06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
final testifier on this uh question
 
06:23:01.750 --> 06:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:01.760 --> 06:23:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
man

06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
man
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
oh it's jim monahan okay jim i didn't
 
06:23:07.590 --> 06:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
recognize how you uh
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
your handwriting is uh not as not as
 
06:23:30.628 --> 06:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:32.948 --> 06:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
could you turn on your microphone yeah
 
06:23:34.628 --> 06:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh yeah anyway i won't say the whole
 
06:23:36.070 --> 06:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
thing i'm jim monahan with the dupont
 
06:23:37.910 --> 06:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
group and i'm here on behalf of the new
 
06:23:40.230 --> 06:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
england power generators association
 
06:23:42.070 --> 06:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's in that capacity we often help
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
clients move through the site evaluation
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee process
 
06:23:48.230 --> 06:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't check off support or oppose yet
 
06:23:49.670 --> 06:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
on this bill because we're still digging
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
into it
 
06:23:52.628 --> 06:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
but we have been watching the work that
 
06:23:54.230 --> 06:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has been doing
 
06:23:55.830 --> 06:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
on taking a hard look at the site
 
06:23:57.910 --> 06:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee and i certainly
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to come here today and say
 
06:23:59.280 --> 06:23:59.990 align:start position:0%
don't want to come here today and say
that

06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:01.590 --> 06:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
the system is perfect
 
06:24:04.150 --> 06:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
and probably does need some reforms it's
 
06:24:05.990 --> 06:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to take into account what we've learned
 
06:24:07.750 --> 06:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
since some of these
 
06:24:09.030 --> 06:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
laws have been passed and people have
 
06:24:10.948 --> 06:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
been moved through them um the
 
06:24:13.350 --> 06:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
interesting part of this bill and this
 
06:24:14.708 --> 06:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
is where we want to dig into a little
 
06:24:16.708 --> 06:24:16.718 align:start position:0%
bit and it sounds like the folks behind
 
06:24:19.270 --> 06:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
me have a bit already that the child car
 
06:24:20.948 --> 06:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
process if you've ever been through it
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know is a cakewalk this is a
 
06:24:24.708 --> 06:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
cakewalk compared to the child car
 
06:24:26.948 --> 06:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
process because the attorneys did you
 
06:24:28.628 --> 06:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
know dig into everything that comes
 
06:24:30.628 --> 06:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
before the job car and
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
as has been observed associated every
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
rule with a statutory authority to do it
 
06:24:36.948 --> 06:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
but i do want to take a hard look at the
 
06:24:39.030 --> 06:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
three four provisions in this bill to
 
06:24:41.430 --> 06:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
see what they pointed to
 
06:24:43.510 --> 06:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
i suspected in part
 
06:24:46.230 --> 06:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh it is uh what is generally reviewed
 
06:24:48.468 --> 06:24:48.478 align:start position:0%
to as the four part test at the site
 
06:24:50.310 --> 06:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee for before a
 
06:24:52.948 --> 06:24:52.958 align:start position:0%
certificate can be issued and my
 
06:24:54.708 --> 06:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
computer battery died so i can't give
 
06:24:56.468 --> 06:24:56.478 align:start position:0%
you the specific site but
 
06:24:56.478 --> 06:24:57.430 align:start position:0%
you the specific site but
um

06:24:57.430 --> 06:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:00.150 --> 06:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
the the four parts typically
 
06:25:03.030 --> 06:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
um the four-part test are you know does
 
06:25:04.390 --> 06:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
the developer have the financial
 
06:25:07.350 --> 06:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to uh develop the project
 
06:25:11.030 --> 06:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
um is it being developed uh in a uh
 
06:25:13.990 --> 06:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
in a manner that's uh reasonable for the
 
06:25:16.310 --> 06:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh regional development and that in that
 
06:25:18.468 --> 06:25:18.478 align:start position:0%
instance they have to take into account
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh municipal concerns and uh regional um
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
development concerns
 
06:25:27.910 --> 06:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then the third part uh is uh there's
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a
 
06:25:32.150 --> 06:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
a list of things that have to be
 
06:25:33.430 --> 06:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
proven if you're going to get your
 
06:25:36.788 --> 06:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
certificate among those are that
 
06:25:38.548 --> 06:25:38.558 align:start position:0%
it doesn't interfere with the aesthetics
 
06:25:40.628 --> 06:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
of the region and that it takes into
 
06:25:42.948 --> 06:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
account public safety
 
06:25:45.910 --> 06:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
when it um and i suspect that part of
 
06:25:47.830 --> 06:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
that and then the fourth part is that
 
06:25:49.350 --> 06:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's in the public interest and that was
 
06:25:49.360 --> 06:25:50.230 align:start position:0%
it's in the public interest and that was
addressed

06:25:50.230 --> 06:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
06:25:50.240 --> 06:25:51.110 align:start position:0%
addressed
here

06:25:51.110 --> 06:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:25:52.708 --> 06:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
um what's
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
helpful to a developer when they're
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
going through the site evaluation
 
06:25:57.670 --> 06:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
process is trying to better understand
 
06:25:59.910 --> 06:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
what things like aesthetics and public
 
06:26:02.548 --> 06:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
safety mean that type of predictability
 
06:26:04.310 --> 06:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
helps a project get through the process
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they can point to
 
06:26:09.830 --> 06:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
meeting a specific test and so the
 
06:26:11.350 --> 06:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
rules that are identified around
 
06:26:13.190 --> 06:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
aesthetics and in
 
06:26:15.190 --> 06:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh fire protection that are identified
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
in the bill i think are probably fall
 
06:26:19.430 --> 06:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
under that category of that important
 
06:26:21.750 --> 06:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
test now i'll go back and dig into it
 
06:26:25.270 --> 06:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
and see if it's it's the case
 
06:26:28.628 --> 06:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh if it's not then you know uh you know
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
you have to take a hard look at what the
 
06:26:32.948 --> 06:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
the gel card did but i suspect that
 
06:26:34.468 --> 06:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
whatever commissioner hornenberg at the
 
06:26:35.910 --> 06:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
time pointed to
 
06:26:38.150 --> 06:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh was something that met their test
 
06:26:40.230 --> 06:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
um and then finally i would just echo
 
06:26:41.670 --> 06:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
what others have said that i am
 
06:26:44.468 --> 06:26:44.478 align:start position:0%
concerned about uh the practical effects
 
06:26:45.910 --> 06:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
of this because we're essentially asking
 
06:26:48.150 --> 06:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee to police
 
06:26:49.750 --> 06:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
themselves and come back and say that
 
06:26:51.910 --> 06:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
the rules are consistent with you know
 
06:26:54.868 --> 06:26:54.878 align:start position:0%
how they proposed them in 2014 or 2015
 
06:26:56.628 --> 06:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is it will be a time
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
consuming process um
 
06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll answer any questions a
 
06:27:04.150 --> 06:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
lot in a lot has been
 
06:27:05.270 --> 06:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
addressed that i would have raised
 
06:27:07.430 --> 06:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
anyway from from other speakers but you
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
know i enjoy working representative
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
harrington and i do think there's
 
06:27:12.708 --> 06:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
opportunities to make things better at
 
06:27:15.190 --> 06:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee um and so
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
and i think there's another more
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
comprehensive study commission that's
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
being proposed too which may be the
 
06:27:21.510 --> 06:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
better way to look at some of these
 
06:27:21.520 --> 06:27:24.230 align:start position:0%
better way to look at some of these
things

06:27:24.230 --> 06:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:27.350 --> 06:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh questions for mr
 
06:27:27.360 --> 06:27:30.868 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh questions for mr
monaghan

06:27:30.868 --> 06:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:33.190 --> 06:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
06:27:37.110 --> 06:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:27:39.750 --> 06:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
you kind of sped up there at the end and
 
06:27:39.760 --> 06:27:40.468 align:start position:0%
you kind of sped up there at the end and
and

06:27:40.468 --> 06:27:40.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:43.190 --> 06:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
if you could just back up on the last
 
06:27:45.990 --> 06:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
two points that you made
 
06:27:49.430 --> 06:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh one was about the sec having to
 
06:27:53.430 --> 06:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
vet itself did i get the verb right
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps i think what i was saying is
 
06:27:56.468 --> 06:27:56.478 align:start position:0%
and representative votes made this
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
observation too that what the bill is
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
asking the site evaluation committee to
 
06:28:02.230 --> 06:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
do is to go in and
 
06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
i guess kind of audit its rules to make
 
06:28:06.468 --> 06:28:06.478 align:start position:0%
sure that they're operating properly
 
06:28:07.830 --> 06:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
under the statute
 
06:28:09.750 --> 06:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
um you know i'd be surprised if they
 
06:28:11.270 --> 06:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
came back and said
 
06:28:16.230 --> 06:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:17.670 --> 06:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
and then the other point that i had
 
06:28:19.430 --> 06:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
trouble with you said that you you
 
06:28:20.788 --> 06:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
recognize that this might be an
 
06:28:23.350 --> 06:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make things better but
 
06:28:23.360 --> 06:28:24.948 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make things better but
that

06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:28:27.670 --> 06:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
was was it a time concern that you what
 
06:28:29.110 --> 06:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
were you going to get much bang for the
 
06:28:31.830 --> 06:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
buck if if you
 
06:28:35.910 --> 06:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
imposed this audit on the sec i would
 
06:28:37.270 --> 06:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
was that right i guess i'm not exactly
 
06:28:38.468 --> 06:28:38.478 align:start position:0%
sure that that's what i was saying so i
 
06:28:40.150 --> 06:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
apologize if i spoke too fast what i'm
 
06:28:42.390 --> 06:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
saying is that you know that may be an
 
06:28:44.070 --> 06:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a more comprehensive
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at the site evaluation committee i
 
06:28:47.110 --> 06:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
know representative i think
 
06:28:49.110 --> 06:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has filed a
 
06:28:50.548 --> 06:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
bill on that front i know there was a
 
06:28:52.948 --> 06:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
study committee that i sat in on
 
06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
this last summer that raised some larger
 
06:28:55.760 --> 06:28:56.628 align:start position:0%
this last summer that raised some larger
issues

06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
this these issues might be better raised
 
06:29:01.030 --> 06:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
in that context and and
 
06:29:03.990 --> 06:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify go ahead follow up
 
06:29:05.910 --> 06:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
i had a little trouble maybe it's my
 
06:29:05.920 --> 06:29:06.948 align:start position:0%
i had a little trouble maybe it's my
hearing

06:29:06.948 --> 06:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
did this other body or other group that
 
06:29:12.548 --> 06:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
is looking at a more comp could you just
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
repeat that uh what i'm saying is i
 
06:29:16.948 --> 06:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
underst i believe that representative
 
06:29:18.788 --> 06:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
harrington has filed another piece of
 
06:29:18.798 --> 06:29:20.788 align:start position:0%
harrington has filed another piece of
legislation

06:29:20.788 --> 06:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:29:22.548 --> 06:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
or perhaps not well there was a study
 
06:29:22.558 --> 06:29:23.670 align:start position:0%
or perhaps not well there was a study
committee

06:29:23.670 --> 06:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:29:26.150 --> 06:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
um uh this past summer that took a hard
 
06:29:27.670 --> 06:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
look at the site evaluation committee
 
06:29:28.468 --> 06:29:28.478 align:start position:0%
and i
 
06:29:30.150 --> 06:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i apologize i'm looking at like now
 
06:29:31.510 --> 06:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that bill was actually
 
06:29:31.520 --> 06:29:32.788 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that bill was actually
filed

06:29:32.788 --> 06:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
filed
 
06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's a senate bill okay
 
06:29:38.708 --> 06:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
there are actually two senate bills
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
one senate bill both are sponsored by
 
06:29:44.310 --> 06:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative i mean senator gaida and
 
06:29:46.390 --> 06:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative harrington and myself are
 
06:29:48.948 --> 06:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of both bills
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
and one bill sets up a committee
 
06:29:55.910 --> 06:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
to look at a long-term restructuring of
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee
 
06:30:01.110 --> 06:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the second bill
 
06:30:01.120 --> 06:30:03.030 align:start position:0%
and the second bill
makes

06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
makes
 
06:30:04.868 --> 06:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
numerous i can't remember exactly how
 
06:30:07.030 --> 06:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
many a dozen or more
 
06:30:11.190 --> 06:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
changes to rsa h162
 
06:30:11.200 --> 06:30:12.390 align:start position:0%
changes to rsa h162
to

06:30:12.390 --> 06:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:30:15.110 --> 06:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
improve the short-term operation
 
06:30:17.670 --> 06:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the site evaluation committee
 
06:30:21.190 --> 06:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think any of those changes in
 
06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
the second bill that i just mentioned
 
06:30:25.990 --> 06:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
address any of the issues that
 
06:30:27.510 --> 06:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:30:27.520 --> 06:30:31.430 align:start position:0%
this bill
addresses

06:30:31.430 --> 06:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:34.628 --> 06:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
only peripherally if if at all but
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's what those other two bills do
 
06:30:39.030 --> 06:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
so the one question i would have for you
 
06:30:41.910 --> 06:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
just to to wrap things up here is
 
06:30:44.310 --> 06:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
06:30:47.350 --> 06:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
as it's currently written 162 h
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
provides adequate definitions of what it
 
06:30:53.030 --> 06:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
means by aesthetics and public health
 
06:30:55.110 --> 06:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
and safety
 
06:30:56.948 --> 06:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
in order for
 
06:30:59.110 --> 06:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
precise rules to be written
 
06:31:01.750 --> 06:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
around those
 
06:31:01.760 --> 06:31:05.750 align:start position:0%
around those
concepts

06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:09.590 --> 06:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:11.590 --> 06:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
there do need to be administrative rules
 
06:31:13.590 --> 06:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
so that there's predictability for
 
06:31:15.590 --> 06:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
developers about what aesthetics and
 
06:31:18.070 --> 06:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
public safety mean
 
06:31:18.080 --> 06:31:18.868 align:start position:0%
public safety mean
and

06:31:18.868 --> 06:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:31:20.310 --> 06:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
subject to check with my clients that
 
06:31:21.350 --> 06:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
have moved through the process are
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
getting ready to move through the
 
06:31:22.558 --> 06:31:23.510 align:start position:0%
getting ready to move through the
process

06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:31:26.390 --> 06:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh the rules about visual impacts and
 
06:31:28.948 --> 06:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
then uh the other rule here with regard
 
06:31:28.958 --> 06:31:29.830 align:start position:0%
then uh the other rule here with regard
to

06:31:29.830 --> 06:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:31:32.628 --> 06:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
fire protection things like that make it
 
06:31:34.948 --> 06:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
easier for a developer to say i have met
 
06:31:36.310 --> 06:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
the test
 
06:31:38.948 --> 06:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
of of the of you know part three of the
 
06:31:41.590 --> 06:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
four-part test
 
06:31:43.430 --> 06:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay good representative plett has a
 
06:31:43.440 --> 06:31:44.390 align:start position:0%
okay good representative plett has a
question

06:31:44.390 --> 06:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:31:45.750 --> 06:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:31:47.270 --> 06:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing about some of these
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
rules and the way we're written aren't
 
06:31:50.310 --> 06:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
they couldn't they be a death knell to
 
06:31:51.990 --> 06:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
any project
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
nobody nobody beats any kind of uh
 
06:31:55.590 --> 06:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
visual or
 
06:31:58.708 --> 06:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
impact or well for all the bad rap the
 
06:32:00.708 --> 06:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
sec has gotten i've only seen one
 
06:32:03.830 --> 06:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
project denied i mean most get through i
 
06:32:05.910 --> 06:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
mean it's a challenge
 
06:32:05.920 --> 06:32:06.948 align:start position:0%
mean it's a challenge
um

06:32:06.948 --> 06:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:09.110 --> 06:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
but no so i don't
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
many don't develop because they don't
 
06:32:12.070 --> 06:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
get that far representative i think
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's a fair observation but i'm not
 
06:32:16.548 --> 06:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
06:32:18.708 --> 06:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
these will constitute a death note
 
06:32:18.718 --> 06:32:20.468 align:start position:0%
these will constitute a death note
but

06:32:20.468 --> 06:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
i can certainly consult with a developer
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
that decided not to go forward because
 
06:32:25.030 --> 06:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
they couldn't meet a you know one of the
 
06:32:25.040 --> 06:32:26.548 align:start position:0%
they couldn't meet a you know one of the
tests

06:32:26.548 --> 06:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
tests
 
06:32:28.830 --> 06:32:28.840 align:start position:0%

energy facilities and i i know
 
06:32:40.230 --> 06:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
just as a simple yes yes or no
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
are there certain federal rules that
 
06:32:45.680 --> 06:32:47.430 align:start position:0%
are there certain federal rules that
supersede

06:32:47.430 --> 06:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
supersede
 
06:32:50.070 --> 06:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
what the state might want are there
 
06:32:52.310 --> 06:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
federal regulations concerning the
 
06:32:54.788 --> 06:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
construction and operation
 
06:32:54.798 --> 06:32:56.390 align:start position:0%
construction and operation
of

06:32:56.390 --> 06:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:32:58.548 --> 06:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
energy facilities
 
06:33:01.750 --> 06:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:04.390 --> 06:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to uh
 
06:33:06.788 --> 06:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
wrap it up with that answer to the
 
06:33:08.788 --> 06:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
question we appreciate your testimony mr

thank you mr chairman um i don't get a
 
06:33:53.430 --> 06:33:53.440 align:start position:0%

four five six and seven
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty simple bill that was
 
06:34:06.230 --> 06:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
written wrong so you do have an
 
06:34:06.240 --> 06:34:08.628 align:start position:0%
written wrong so you do have an
amendment

06:34:08.628 --> 06:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:34:11.270 --> 06:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
we crossed out the wrong part
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
what we crossed out was
 
06:34:15.510 --> 06:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
and is approved by the utilities which
 
06:34:18.390 --> 06:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
was never intended to be crossed out
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
and what was intended to be crossed out
 
06:34:23.190 --> 06:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
is what's in the
 
06:34:26.548 --> 06:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:29.750 --> 06:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
the new bill that's just been approved
 
06:34:32.310 --> 06:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it starts with licensed licensed in
 
06:34:34.868 --> 06:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
06:34:37.030 --> 06:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
what that means is
 
06:34:38.548 --> 06:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
you know if you see a line truck with a
 
06:34:40.628 --> 06:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
couple linemen on it
 
06:34:42.230 --> 06:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
chances are
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
they might not be licensed because
 
06:34:46.310 --> 06:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
they're not required to be
 
06:34:47.910 --> 06:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
the only time
 
06:34:50.948 --> 06:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
alignment is required to have a license
 
06:34:53.110 --> 06:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
is if he's working beyond the primary
 
06:34:55.510 --> 06:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
meter box
 
06:34:58.070 --> 06:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
up until the primary meter box
 
06:35:00.948 --> 06:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are not licensed
 
06:35:02.230 --> 06:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
06:35:04.788 --> 06:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's the whole gist of this um
 
06:35:06.788 --> 06:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
they don't if we can get into more but
 
06:35:08.788 --> 06:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
that that's what it means
 
06:35:10.628 --> 06:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh they're not required
 
06:35:12.948 --> 06:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
the utility company i mean the
 
06:35:15.270 --> 06:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
subcontractor whoever it is
 
06:35:17.510 --> 06:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
does have to be approved by the utility
 
06:35:17.520 --> 06:35:21.830 align:start position:0%
does have to be approved by the utility
company

06:35:21.830 --> 06:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:26.548 --> 06:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:29.270 --> 06:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you obviously a relatively
 
06:35:32.070 --> 06:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
simple bill but maybe more questions are
 
06:35:33.910 --> 06:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
needed to understand exactly what it's
 
06:35:35.830 --> 06:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
for so representative platt wanted to
 
06:35:38.150 --> 06:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
lead us off thank you mr chair thank you
 
06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
06:35:43.750 --> 06:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
rudy the purpose of this uh is to why
 
06:35:43.760 --> 06:35:44.468 align:start position:0%
rudy the purpose of this uh is to why
why

06:35:44.468 --> 06:35:44.478 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:35:46.628 --> 06:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
is it to speed things up is it to save
 
06:35:49.750 --> 06:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
money why why introduce this change well
 
06:35:52.150 --> 06:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
if this is the law right now
 
06:35:54.150 --> 06:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of people working for the
 
06:35:56.548 --> 06:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
utility companies and subcontractors
 
06:35:56.558 --> 06:35:57.350 align:start position:0%
utility companies and subcontractors
that

06:35:57.350 --> 06:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:35:57.360 --> 06:35:59.190 align:start position:0%
that
are

06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
working against the law
 
06:36:11.750 --> 06:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:11.760 --> 06:36:12.948 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

representative harrington is recognized
 
06:36:16.230 --> 06:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:36:17.910 --> 06:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so i'm just trying to
 
06:36:19.750 --> 06:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
make sure i get this straight then what
 
06:36:22.070 --> 06:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying is if we
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be a power line
 
06:36:26.070 --> 06:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
extension done on private property
 
06:36:28.628 --> 06:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
and that extension is done by utility
 
06:36:28.638 --> 06:36:29.990 align:start position:0%
and that extension is done by utility
personnel

06:36:29.990 --> 06:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
06:36:33.270 --> 06:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
they may not be licensed electricians
 
06:36:36.230 --> 06:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
but if a contractor is hired to do it
 
06:36:38.468 --> 06:36:38.478 align:start position:0%
under present law they would have to be
 
06:36:42.548 --> 06:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
licensed electricians well that i think
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
the way i read it anybody
 
06:36:46.548 --> 06:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
working on that power line has to be
 
06:36:46.558 --> 06:36:48.070 align:start position:0%
working on that power line has to be
licensed

06:36:48.070 --> 06:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
06:36:50.468 --> 06:36:50.478 align:start position:0%
well this says a utility customer that
 
06:36:52.628 --> 06:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
requires a power line extension located
 
06:36:54.468 --> 06:36:54.478 align:start position:0%
on private property may hire a
 
06:36:57.190 --> 06:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
contractor who was okay yeah
 
06:36:59.430 --> 06:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
so but these um
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
these subcontractors who work for
 
06:37:04.548 --> 06:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
companies all over
 
06:37:07.750 --> 06:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
not only the people in the state but
 
06:37:09.910 --> 06:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
say you have a power outage and you
 
06:37:11.590 --> 06:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
bring people in from out of state
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts new york

north carolina ohio canada
 
06:37:18.548 --> 06:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
all of these people you don't expect
 
06:37:22.390 --> 06:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:25.910 --> 06:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:28.230 --> 06:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay who's next uh there must be a
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
million questions about this bill
 
06:37:33.830 --> 06:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative callie pitts i just
 
06:37:35.910 --> 06:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative buru i just didn't
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you said
 
06:37:39.510 --> 06:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's late in the day
 
06:37:41.990 --> 06:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody if we have an emergency and
 
06:37:43.590 --> 06:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
crews come in from
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
different places
 
06:37:45.600 --> 06:37:47.910 align:start position:0%
different places
um

06:37:47.910 --> 06:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:49.830 --> 06:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
you would expect that they
 
06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
06:37:53.590 --> 06:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
licensed no not necessarily well they
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be but
 
06:37:57.750 --> 06:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's not required
 
06:37:59.990 --> 06:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
06:38:02.310 --> 06:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
chances are they're not
 
06:38:04.468 --> 06:38:04.478 align:start position:0%
holding a new hampshire license
 
06:38:04.478 --> 06:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
holding a new hampshire license
but

06:38:05.670 --> 06:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:38:08.070 --> 06:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
they have a working agreement with other
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a working agreement
 
06:38:11.430 --> 06:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
with other states
 
06:38:13.990 --> 06:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me canada and everything so those
 
06:38:17.270 --> 06:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
people you know won't have a license
 
06:38:19.510 --> 06:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
but it's not required the only thing
 
06:38:21.590 --> 06:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's required is
 
06:38:24.788 --> 06:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
the subcontractor is approved by the
 
06:38:28.548 --> 06:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:28.558 --> 06:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

06:38:30.230 --> 06:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:38:33.270 --> 06:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
a follow-up excuse me it's the sun if
 
06:38:34.468 --> 06:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
some if
 
06:38:35.750 --> 06:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
if i was
 
06:38:38.310 --> 06:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
learning the business
 
06:38:40.150 --> 06:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
and i was working
 
06:38:40.160 --> 06:38:41.110 align:start position:0%
and i was working
under

06:38:41.110 --> 06:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:38:42.628 --> 06:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
a licensed
 
06:38:42.638 --> 06:38:44.948 align:start position:0%
a licensed
contractor

06:38:44.948 --> 06:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
06:38:47.590 --> 06:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't be licensed
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
right well first of all they're not
 
06:38:51.190 --> 06:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
licensed contractors they're approved
 
06:38:51.200 --> 06:38:53.430 align:start position:0%
licensed contractors they're approved
contractors

06:38:53.430 --> 06:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
06:38:55.590 --> 06:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
the the contractors aren't licensed
 
06:38:58.230 --> 06:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're approved they're approved yes
 
06:39:00.310 --> 06:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's almost like if you're brand new
 
06:39:01.590 --> 06:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's like going through an apprentice
 
06:39:03.270 --> 06:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
program there's steps there's different
 
06:39:03.280 --> 06:39:04.230 align:start position:0%
program there's steps there's different
steps

06:39:04.230 --> 06:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
steps
 
06:39:06.150 --> 06:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
first class second class third fourth
 
06:39:08.070 --> 06:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
class lineman
 
06:39:10.390 --> 06:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
06:39:12.310 --> 06:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
like a private contractor would have a
 
06:39:13.750 --> 06:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
manual that they
 
06:39:15.590 --> 06:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
they send into the department of labor
 
06:39:17.830 --> 06:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
that they go by and how they
 
06:39:20.788 --> 06:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
promote their people and
 
06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
i believe the labor department could do
 
06:39:25.350 --> 06:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
it but i don't know if they anybody does
 
06:39:27.190 --> 06:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
it through the labor department
 
06:39:28.628 --> 06:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
everybody likes to train their own
 
06:39:28.638 --> 06:39:30.948 align:start position:0%
everybody likes to train their own
people

06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:39:32.788 --> 06:39:32.798 align:start position:0%
probably for insurance reasons to make
 
06:39:32.798 --> 06:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
probably for insurance reasons to make
sure

06:39:33.590 --> 06:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:39:34.868 --> 06:39:34.878 align:start position:0%
they don't get whacked with a big
 
06:39:40.070 --> 06:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:42.070 --> 06:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative pementel is recognized
 
06:39:44.788 --> 06:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
06:39:47.110 --> 06:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:39:51.110 --> 06:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ruby
 
06:39:53.430 --> 06:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm a little bit lost on what
 
06:39:58.070 --> 06:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:00.628 --> 06:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
are you trying to make sure that
 
06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
all people who are working on on a line
 
06:40:09.270 --> 06:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
extension are licensed
 
06:40:09.280 --> 06:40:10.948 align:start position:0%
extension are licensed
no

06:40:10.948 --> 06:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
no it's not required
 
06:40:14.310 --> 06:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
and but the way
 
06:40:17.750 --> 06:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
the way this isn't a statute now
 
06:40:20.548 --> 06:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
it it alludes to they have to be
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
licensed when
 
06:40:24.310 --> 06:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
right now a lot of people out probably a
 
06:40:25.750 --> 06:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
third of the people working out there
 
06:40:27.590 --> 06:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
are not licensed
 
06:40:27.600 --> 06:40:32.230 align:start position:0%
are not licensed
okay

06:40:32.230 --> 06:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:36.230 --> 06:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:39.270 --> 06:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
if he doesn't the follow-up is
 
06:40:41.270 --> 06:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh because we're not looking at what's
 
06:40:43.670 --> 06:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
being changed we're looking at
 
06:40:45.750 --> 06:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
because we haven't seen the amendment
 
06:40:47.510 --> 06:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
how does your bill
 
06:40:48.708 --> 06:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
change it
 
06:40:49.830 --> 06:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
so that it
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
does it does allow people
 
06:40:57.990 --> 06:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:00.070 --> 06:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's scratch's uh requirement for the
 
06:41:01.590 --> 06:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
license all right i have a follow-up
 
06:41:01.600 --> 06:41:02.788 align:start position:0%
license all right i have a follow-up
question

06:41:02.788 --> 06:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:41:02.798 --> 06:41:06.628 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:41:06.628 --> 06:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:09.110 --> 06:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
contractor who is licensed in the city
 
06:41:09.120 --> 06:41:10.788 align:start position:0%
contractor who is licensed in the city
uh

06:41:10.788 --> 06:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:41:10.798 --> 06:41:12.390 align:start position:0%
uh
you're

06:41:12.390 --> 06:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:41:14.230 --> 06:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
according to this you're not really
 
06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
requiring them to be
 
06:41:18.788 --> 06:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
not only not licensed in new hampshire
 
06:41:20.390 --> 06:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to be licensed in
 
06:41:23.510 --> 06:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
any other state no okay
 
06:41:26.310 --> 06:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative oxenam has
 
06:41:28.150 --> 06:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:41:29.670 --> 06:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
well i almost thought that i wasn't
 
06:41:31.110 --> 06:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
going to need to follow up because he
 
06:41:33.590 --> 06:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
was going to clarify it so let's let's
 
06:41:35.590 --> 06:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
just just you know we've got the bill
 
06:41:37.190 --> 06:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
we've got the amendment what you're
 
06:41:38.788 --> 06:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just clean up the
 
06:41:40.948 --> 06:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
statute because it says people have to
 
06:41:43.110 --> 06:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
be licensed and in fact they don't
 
06:41:45.430 --> 06:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's a correct right thank you so much
 
06:41:47.270 --> 06:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
sir okay
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative thomas has a
 
06:41:49.680 --> 06:41:51.110 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative thomas has a
question

06:41:51.110 --> 06:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:41:52.788 --> 06:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:41:54.628 --> 06:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
06:41:55.590 --> 06:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
if the
 
06:41:58.548 --> 06:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
if if we were to introduce the uh your
 
06:42:00.230 --> 06:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
suggested amendment
 
06:42:00.240 --> 06:42:01.590 align:start position:0%
suggested amendment
um

06:42:01.590 --> 06:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:02.788 --> 06:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
are you
 
06:42:04.948 --> 06:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
um one of my questions
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
so the utilities would have to approve
 
06:42:10.868 --> 06:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
the person doing the work on the grounds
 
06:42:13.510 --> 06:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh am i to assume that the utilities
 
06:42:16.070 --> 06:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
have their own criteria for having
 
06:42:18.708 --> 06:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
licensed people to do work that that
 
06:42:20.150 --> 06:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
that they would prove
 
06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
well the way i understand it is a
 
06:42:22.160 --> 06:42:23.270 align:start position:0%
well the way i understand it is a
utility

06:42:23.270 --> 06:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
utility
 
06:42:26.070 --> 06:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
would approve a contractor
 
06:42:27.990 --> 06:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
the contractor is the one who does the
 
06:42:28.000 --> 06:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
the contractor is the one who does the
training

06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
and does the promotions and whatever
 
06:42:32.390 --> 06:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:42:34.628 --> 06:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
really the the subcontractor is the one
 
06:42:37.190 --> 06:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
that is responsible
 
06:42:37.200 --> 06:42:38.788 align:start position:0%
that is responsible
um

06:42:38.788 --> 06:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:40.628 --> 06:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
but they don't have a license but they
 
06:42:42.548 --> 06:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
are they're approved
 
06:42:44.548 --> 06:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
so the individual is not approved but
 
06:42:47.510 --> 06:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
the company is
 
06:42:49.430 --> 06:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up
 
06:42:49.440 --> 06:42:50.788 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up
follow-up

06:42:50.788 --> 06:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:42:50.798 --> 06:42:52.150 align:start position:0%
follow-up
okay

06:42:52.150 --> 06:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:42:52.160 --> 06:42:53.270 align:start position:0%
okay
i

06:42:53.270 --> 06:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:42:55.430 --> 06:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
my question was really
 
06:42:57.190 --> 06:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
do utilities
 
06:43:00.310 --> 06:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
require their contractors to be licensed
 
06:43:02.628 --> 06:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
to do work that they approve on
 
06:43:02.638 --> 06:43:03.590 align:start position:0%
to do work that they approve on
no

06:43:03.590 --> 06:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:43:05.910 --> 06:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay they just they just have to approve
 
06:43:05.920 --> 06:43:06.788 align:start position:0%
okay they just they just have to approve
them

06:43:06.788 --> 06:43:06.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:43:09.830 --> 06:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:14.070 --> 06:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay who's next representative creation
 
06:43:15.590 --> 06:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
06:43:17.910 --> 06:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question hi neighbor
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question so i'm not
 
06:43:22.150 --> 06:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with this rsa but i
 
06:43:24.628 --> 06:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
did notice that this bill is only
 
06:43:26.548 --> 06:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the installation of power
 
06:43:29.830 --> 06:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
line extensions um is there
 
06:43:31.270 --> 06:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
i guess is there anything else in this
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
rsa that should also be amended at the
 
06:43:35.110 --> 06:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
same time or is there any reason that
 
06:43:37.270 --> 06:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
this was exclusive to the you know
 
06:43:39.030 --> 06:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
extending of the line to the house
 
06:43:39.040 --> 06:43:40.788 align:start position:0%
extending of the line to the house
um

06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
i think this is adequate i mean it's
 
06:43:46.548 --> 06:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
it's what's being done now is um they're
 
06:43:46.558 --> 06:43:47.510 align:start position:0%
it's what's being done now is um they're
not

06:43:47.510 --> 06:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:43:50.150 --> 06:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're not licensing people now so this
 
06:43:50.160 --> 06:43:50.868 align:start position:0%
they're not licensing people now so this
is

06:43:50.868 --> 06:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:43:50.878 --> 06:43:52.868 align:start position:0%
is
uh

06:43:52.868 --> 06:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:43:55.270 --> 06:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
anybody working maybe working breaking
 
06:43:57.350 --> 06:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
the law if they're not licensed so
 
06:43:59.190 --> 06:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we tried to clean it up a
 
06:44:01.510 --> 06:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
06:44:04.230 --> 06:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:04.240 --> 06:44:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:44:05.750 --> 06:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
06:44:09.990 --> 06:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like an obvious question
 
06:44:13.190 --> 06:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
here is would a utility approve a
 
06:44:16.628 --> 06:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
contractor who's not licensed
 
06:44:18.868 --> 06:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
no they they approved the they approved
 
06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
the contractor
 
06:44:31.590 --> 06:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.788 --> 06:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
okay so the question remains
 
06:44:36.788 --> 06:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
if i'm going to hire a contractor and
 
06:44:38.390 --> 06:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
i've got two guys who come to me and one
 
06:44:40.468 --> 06:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
guy has a license and one guy doesn't
 
06:44:41.910 --> 06:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm a utility
 
06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
am i going to hire the guy who doesn't
 
06:44:45.510 --> 06:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
have a license
 
06:44:47.270 --> 06:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
well i think they just put everything
 
06:44:50.150 --> 06:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
out to bid but anyone they hire is on
 
06:44:52.868 --> 06:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
their approved list usually
 
06:44:54.468 --> 06:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
if they approve you you're an approved
 
06:44:54.478 --> 06:44:56.310 align:start position:0%
if they approve you you're an approved
contractor

06:44:56.310 --> 06:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
06:44:58.788 --> 06:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
and by approving a contractor you're
 
06:44:58.798 --> 06:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
and by approving a contractor you're
approving

06:44:59.910 --> 06:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
approving
 
06:45:02.230 --> 06:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
the people who work for that company
 
06:45:04.230 --> 06:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
so another way to ask the question then
 
06:45:06.070 --> 06:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
would be would a utility approve a
 
06:45:09.030 --> 06:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
contractor who's not licensed
 
06:45:09.040 --> 06:45:10.788 align:start position:0%
contractor who's not licensed
no

06:45:10.788 --> 06:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:45:12.628 --> 06:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
no i mean if they're
 
06:45:12.638 --> 06:45:13.750 align:start position:0%
no i mean if they're
well

06:45:13.750 --> 06:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:45:16.230 --> 06:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
there is no license
 
06:45:19.750 --> 06:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:23.430 --> 06:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:25.110 --> 06:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel you had a
 
06:45:25.120 --> 06:45:27.590 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel you had a
question

06:45:27.590 --> 06:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:29.830 --> 06:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that's similar to
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
but essentially where would somebody
 
06:45:34.788 --> 06:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
need a license if
 
06:45:38.390 --> 06:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
um i mean what is this license for
 
06:45:40.150 --> 06:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
the only time
 
06:45:42.548 --> 06:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
the only time you would need a license
 
06:45:44.548 --> 06:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
is if you're working beyond the meter
 
06:45:44.558 --> 06:45:45.430 align:start position:0%
is if you're working beyond the meter
box

06:45:45.430 --> 06:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
box
 
06:45:48.390 --> 06:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
like the line will come in and then if
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
you work on the other side of the box
 
06:45:52.948 --> 06:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
that's when you need a license
 
06:45:54.868 --> 06:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
because the utility is not responsible
 
06:45:58.708 --> 06:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:00.230 --> 06:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
they own the line
 
06:46:02.948 --> 06:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
the line goes in and once it hits that
 
06:46:02.958 --> 06:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
the line goes in and once it hits that
box

06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
box
 
06:46:07.350 --> 06:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
utility is not responsible anymore
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
whoever works inside that
 
06:46:13.190 --> 06:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
now that person has to be licensed
 
06:46:14.628 --> 06:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:46:16.948 --> 06:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so essentially
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
linemen are not normally
 
06:46:22.390 --> 06:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
electricians they're not they have an
 
06:46:22.400 --> 06:46:23.430 align:start position:0%
electricians they're not they have an
electric

06:46:23.430 --> 06:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
electric
 
06:46:25.190 --> 06:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
electrician's license
 
06:46:26.788 --> 06:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
and they're allowed
 
06:46:29.830 --> 06:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
to wire up to the meter itself but
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
06:46:33.830 --> 06:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
then you need a license a licensed
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
electrician yeah that's correct but a
 
06:46:37.830 --> 06:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
lot of them do get licenses because
 
06:46:39.910 --> 06:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're working with electricity so but
 
06:46:41.270 --> 06:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
they don't they have a lot of friends
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
who need help
 
06:46:45.910 --> 06:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative harrington has
 
06:46:47.190 --> 06:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
a question
 
06:46:48.390 --> 06:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
not so much of a question maybe there's
 
06:46:50.230 --> 06:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
a clarification that might help okay
 
06:46:52.948 --> 06:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
i've seen at my own house the power
 
06:46:55.030 --> 06:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
lines come down because of ice storms
 
06:46:57.110 --> 06:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the person who came back up and put
 
06:46:59.350 --> 06:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
it up was i assume approved by the
 
06:47:01.670 --> 06:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
utility but they also didn't speak
 
06:47:03.910 --> 06:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
english because they were from canada so
 
06:47:12.708 --> 06:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:13.830 --> 06:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
would it be safe to assume
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative harrington that that
 
06:47:17.910 --> 06:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
person from canada has some
 
06:47:17.920 --> 06:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
person from canada has some
uh

06:47:19.910 --> 06:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
training oh i'm sure that work he was
 
06:47:25.430 --> 06:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
driving a hydro quebec truck and i
 
06:47:27.590 --> 06:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
assume he did the similar work in canada
 
06:47:29.350 --> 06:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
but just during that ice storm he was
 
06:47:31.030 --> 06:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
down in the united states like were a
 
06:47:33.190 --> 06:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
lot of canadians to help us restore our
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
power here so this was not unique to my
 
06:47:36.310 --> 06:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
house i'm sure it was done all over the
 
06:47:36.320 --> 06:47:37.110 align:start position:0%
house i'm sure it was done all over the
state

06:47:37.110 --> 06:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:47:40.390 --> 06:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
they have a reciprocal agreement
 
06:47:42.230 --> 06:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that gets us back to the original
 
06:47:43.910 --> 06:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
question way back at the beginning of
 
06:47:45.670 --> 06:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
06:47:47.990 --> 06:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
why do we need this legislation what's
 
06:47:50.070 --> 06:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it because right now
 
06:47:52.070 --> 06:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
there are some people out there working
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
probably working even for a utility
 
06:48:02.390 --> 06:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:04.948 --> 06:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
06:48:11.350 --> 06:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:13.110 --> 06:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
i've heard a couple times you're saying
 
06:48:15.510 --> 06:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
some people are breaking the law do you
 
06:48:17.030 --> 06:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
have any uh
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
um actual evidence of how many people
 
06:48:22.150 --> 06:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
are pulling lines in new hampshire um
 
06:48:24.548 --> 06:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
are not uh certified depot lines because
 
06:48:25.990 --> 06:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
i understand there's a certification
 
06:48:26.000 --> 06:48:27.030 align:start position:0%
i understand there's a certification
program

06:48:27.030 --> 06:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:48:28.948 --> 06:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
no they're all working under some kind
 
06:48:31.750 --> 06:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:33.270 --> 06:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed but they're working
 
06:48:34.788 --> 06:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
under a program
 
06:48:36.070 --> 06:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
like when you're working on your
 
06:48:38.708 --> 06:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
certification the day you're hired
 
06:48:40.948 --> 06:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
you go into a training program
 
06:48:42.548 --> 06:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
you know and you're like a third class
 
06:48:44.708 --> 06:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
lineman or a fourth class lineman and
 
06:48:45.910 --> 06:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're working with somebody who's
 
06:48:47.590 --> 06:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
teaching you to trade
 
06:48:49.990 --> 06:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
after you get to a certain point you
 
06:48:51.990 --> 06:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
take tests then you can get promoted
 
06:48:53.830 --> 06:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
which means a raise and
 
06:48:56.230 --> 06:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
whatever and it it there's no time limit
 
06:48:58.708 --> 06:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
on it you have to qualify to get the
 
06:49:00.708 --> 06:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
promotion and i think every company
 
06:49:02.868 --> 06:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
might be different but that's normally
 
06:49:04.390 --> 06:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
06:49:06.150 --> 06:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
but you're saying that's now do i
 
06:49:08.628 --> 06:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
understand correctly i'm sorry i have a
 
06:49:10.070 --> 06:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead um
 
06:49:11.430 --> 06:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
but you're saying now there are many
 
06:49:12.948 --> 06:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
people who do not hold that
 
06:49:15.830 --> 06:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
certification who are out work
 
06:49:18.230 --> 06:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
well i'm trying to use language i don't
 
06:49:19.830 --> 06:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
think our linemen actually license are
 
06:49:21.990 --> 06:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
they certified
 
06:49:25.110 --> 06:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
electrician electricians are certified
 
06:49:26.628 --> 06:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
and there is no license there is no
 
06:49:26.638 --> 06:49:27.990 align:start position:0%
and there is no license there is no
license

06:49:27.990 --> 06:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
license
 
06:49:30.310 --> 06:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
and that's what's confusing about this
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
you have license in this in this in the
 
06:49:33.200 --> 06:49:34.230 align:start position:0%
you have license in this in this in the
statute

06:49:34.230 --> 06:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:49:36.868 --> 06:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
when they there is no license well they
 
06:49:38.468 --> 06:49:38.478 align:start position:0%
are certified though they might not be
 
06:49:39.990 --> 06:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
licensed but they are certified with
 
06:49:42.230 --> 06:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
their company yep and their company is
 
06:49:44.628 --> 06:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
also approved by the utility
 
06:49:46.948 --> 06:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
okay so this will not be removing any
 
06:49:48.868 --> 06:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
any requirements for certification
 
06:49:48.878 --> 06:49:49.670 align:start position:0%
any requirements for certification
that's

06:49:49.670 --> 06:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:49:51.430 --> 06:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
removing requirements for a licensing
 
06:49:54.310 --> 06:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
which does not exist right
 
06:49:56.708 --> 06:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
okay thanks you've clarified it greatly
 
06:50:00.788 --> 06:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:04.310 --> 06:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay any uh any further questions for
 
06:50:06.310 --> 06:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative baruti
 
06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
06:50:11.190 --> 06:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
some years ago we passed a license
 
06:50:14.070 --> 06:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
requirement for somebody who puts in
 
06:50:15.670 --> 06:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
solar panels
 
06:50:18.468 --> 06:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
now that's on the roof
 
06:50:20.310 --> 06:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
and that's got to be a licensed
 
06:50:23.510 --> 06:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
electrician correct and that still holds
 
06:50:25.510 --> 06:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're not going to get me to
 
06:50:25.520 --> 06:50:26.708 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're not going to get me to
put

06:50:26.708 --> 06:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
put
 
06:50:28.948 --> 06:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
10 000 volts in your house and blow it
 
06:50:28.958 --> 06:50:30.390 align:start position:0%
10 000 volts in your house and blow it
up

06:50:30.390 --> 06:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:50:32.230 --> 06:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct we're still going to
 
06:50:34.628 --> 06:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
have that requirement for licensed
 
06:50:34.638 --> 06:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
have that requirement for licensed
electricians

06:50:35.990 --> 06:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
electricians
 
06:50:38.468 --> 06:50:38.478 align:start position:0%
yeah this seems to apply only to
 
06:50:41.350 --> 06:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
installation of power line extensions
 
06:50:43.110 --> 06:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with installations of
 
06:50:43.120 --> 06:50:44.230 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with installations of
solar

06:50:44.230 --> 06:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
solar
 
06:50:44.240 --> 06:50:47.430 align:start position:0%
solar
panels

06:50:47.430 --> 06:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:47.440 --> 06:50:48.788 align:start position:0%
 
extension

06:50:48.788 --> 06:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
extension
 
06:50:49.830 --> 06:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
could be
 
06:50:52.390 --> 06:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
what they're doing with the new grid
 
06:50:55.110 --> 06:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
right with redundancy
 
06:50:59.510 --> 06:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:00.948 --> 06:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
some companies
 
06:51:02.948 --> 06:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
and i know this from personal experience
 
06:51:06.150 --> 06:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire electric co-op
 
06:51:08.390 --> 06:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
will bring the power up to the head of
 
06:51:10.468 --> 06:51:10.478 align:start position:0%
your driveway but let's say you have a
 
06:51:12.390 --> 06:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
driveway that's
 
06:51:15.430 --> 06:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
600 700 feet long
 
06:51:16.868 --> 06:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
and you need to get the power down to
 
06:51:18.628 --> 06:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
your house
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
and you need maybe two or three poles to
 
06:51:24.150 --> 06:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
get it down there
 
06:51:26.548 --> 06:51:26.558 align:start position:0%
the utility will charge you like a
 
06:51:28.708 --> 06:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a poll
 
06:51:31.590 --> 06:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
to do that power line extension
 
06:51:34.150 --> 06:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
but you can hire a private contractor to
 
06:51:35.990 --> 06:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
do that extension and they might do it
 
06:51:39.350 --> 06:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
for five hundred dollars a poll
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
so i think that's what we're talking
 
06:51:43.670 --> 06:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
about here with power line extensions
 
06:51:46.708 --> 06:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
i i know someone who actually did that
 
06:51:48.468 --> 06:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
at his house and he saved a lot of money
