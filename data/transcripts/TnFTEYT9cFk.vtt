00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
the time being
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
1:20 let's open the um subcommittee work
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 194 FN and we'll
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
open with a
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
discussion would you like to be
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
recognized representative rung yes thank
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of the original bill
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the amendment is to
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that the state department of
 
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.710 align:start position:0%
ensure that the state department of
historical

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
resources um keeps a current list at
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
least every 10 years a list of all items
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
in the state monuments physical
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledgments of that are of
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
historical relevance that they they
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
compile this inventory and they make it
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
available to education groups whatever
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
and they can easily do that through the
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
through a
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
website so I think that's the intent I
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
think we all agree that that should be
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of division of
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
historical resources is to keep a list
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
of our historical resources and make
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
sure they're
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
accessible I think from uh the
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
conversations we had previously in this
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
committee H is that there was some
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
question about the implementation of
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
that like what historical things are we
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
specific specifically talking about and
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think we also were disadvantaged
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't get
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
firsthand um testimony or comments from
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
the director of the division of
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
historical resources to ensure that it
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be coming at an
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
additional cost to the state that it was
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
something that he could easily absorb
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
within his
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
Department um that he had the staff to
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
be able to do it so um to me I I I I
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
don't really think there's anybody here
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
that disagrees with the intent I think
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
where we're starting from is just on
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
those specifics am I
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
correct that's my interpretation of
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
where we're at right now how about
 
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.590 align:start position:0%
where we're at right now how about
everybody

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
else that's what I think me and Andy had
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
talked about before just a scope how far
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
down are we going is it going to be a
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
grave site which we you know MEC and all
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
our things we have you know a specific
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
gravite or is it just the entire
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
Cemetery or our graveyard or is it um
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
every house that we have a plaque on
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
those are all histo historical things
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the even Historical Society
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
in March is still trying to get some of
 
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.950 align:start position:0%
in March is still trying to get some of
those

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
together oh Madam chair is that okay
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay um absolutely actually
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative Hy when I was waiting for
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
this hearing to begin I was doing a
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
search of the rsas and I search under
 
00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
monuments and monuments except for a
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
specific Monument that's used to
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
designate a
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
boundary um all other references to
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
monuments are separate from grave or
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
headstones gravestones or headstones so
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have to be worried that
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
by including historical monuments that
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's including headstones unless a
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
headstone is deemed to be a historical
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
artifact so maybe it would be the
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
headstone of a historic hisorical figure
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
would be included but just by calling it
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
a monument does not in fact the the
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
current statues actually isolate that
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
word from gravestones so what I see
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
doing and I'm not I I I I'd like to get
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
other people's insight into the
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
amendment but what I see is the marac
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
historical society for example they
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
collect they have a list or you know
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
they know what the historical markers
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
buildings groups of people whatever are
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
in their town and so that every 10 years
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to make sure that an
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
updated not even them the the division
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
of historical resources would have to
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
reach out to historical societies and
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
say hey give me your latest list of
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
historical items so that we can update
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
our list on our website um are we
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
capturing all of the historical items no
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sure not we're that's why we have
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
historical societies to always look and
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
an examine and and determine what is
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
historical in nature this is to me is
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
just a housekeeping bill to make sure
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
that all historical items in the state
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
get funneled up to the state division
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
who has that responsibility and that
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
accessible representative Healey yeah so
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's what I brought up last time
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
historical commissions are formed by
 
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.710 align:start position:0%
historical commissions are formed by
lsrs

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
lsrs
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
societies are volunteers so we got to
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
make this volunteers for them uh it
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be a mandatory thing for them
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
because they don't do they don't do like
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
the historical commissions do um my
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
hometown New Bedford Massachusetts i l
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
searched they have 273 in one
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
town I don't know how far you want to go
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
down that's what I that's what I think
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
Andy was talking about too you know we
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
from like I said historical houses I
 
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
okay graveyards leave it out just a
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
graveyard itself and you know Matthew
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
thon's grave would be one and nowed but
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I say you know we have a lot
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
of these all over the state and we could
 
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
catalog these I have no problem with
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
that um but I if you want to get below
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
that I just want to know how far we're
 
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.350 align:start position:0%
that I just want to know how far we're
going

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
down yeah I I don't I think that I agree
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
with you that a lot of these private
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
organizations like the May Ma histor
 
00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:28.870 align:start position:0%
organizations like the May Ma histor
iCal

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
iCal
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
Society um they wouldn't be compelled or
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
there would be no mandate on them to
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
share what their inventory with the
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
state but they would be invited to share
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
that with the state I just think this is
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
really a perun amendment that just the
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
probably the most important thing it
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
does is it um directs the division of
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
historical resources to ensure that they
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
have an inventory or they keep at least
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
a current inventory of every 10 years of
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
things that are are of historical
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
importance to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
I believe they're the ones that Define
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
that they can reach out to people to
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
keep that list current maybe there are
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
maram Historical Society can reach out
 
00:24:16.909 --> 00:24:16.919 align:start position:0%
to them and say hey we we've just
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
designated this home as a historical
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
site um you know please add that to your
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
list next time it's updated but that the
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources they
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
would then be compelled to ensure that
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
that inventory is publicly accessible
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
and I think I don't want to speak for
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative German but I think that
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
was probably his biggest interest is we
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we make history
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%

00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
mean every I agree with everything about
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
history is my thing
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
well there is so much of
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
it that this is everything is
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
historical and we we need to be able to
 
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
have a we be able need to be able to
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
draw boundaries on the extent of what
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
without Mr Wilson be here we really
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
can't do that with it to to any any
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
degree of specificity
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
so I would really suggest that we look
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
at changing this bill to a
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
committee to be a you know I don't like
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
it I know the speaker don't want like it
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
and uh but the it's our only way of
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
really Sal
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
salvaging this this bill at the moment
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
is because then if you have people who
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
will be able to meet
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
to together and they would be have to
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh over the
 
00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh the rest of the year to be able to
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
sit and work out what a bill would
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
really look like and with all the
 
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
specificity of of doing doing uh that
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
necessary uh I right now still wonder
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
about saying his uh will Mr
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
Wilson's statements that oh I don't
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't need any more money I
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
got we can we can do this without any
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
additional money well I think Finance
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
might want us be interested in just that
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
comment alone that you've got what are
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
you doing now
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
that do you have that you have extra
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
time to be able to do something else
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
something that could be very sign
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
ific that has to be worked out uh you
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
know is and what is the scope I if all
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is an Excel
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh that's one thing but is
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
how good is that for a uh uh for anyone
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
trying to dig into the uh to be use that
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
as a tool to uh to to dig into the uh
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
into a historical
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh in in a historical search
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh I just don't I'm not certain where we
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
can I don't think we can get there from
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
here with what we have so I would
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
suggest a uh a Comm a committee not a
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
commission commiss committee ends at the
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
end of this it will end at the end of
 
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.549 align:start position:0%
end of this it will end at the end of
the

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
session representative Rong
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect to my my
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
colleague from Hudson I actually think
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
we should recommend interm study or itl
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
for this bill and I say it with complete
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
respect for representative ger but Mr
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
Wilson isn't here and he is a a real
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert and a real
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholder that we needed his input um
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
I don't even know if he would show up
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
for a study committee um and so I I just
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
be I I just think we have to let this
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
bill die um I mean if there is interest
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
in interm study some people can work
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
over it on the summer and recommend a
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill in you know late
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
2024 but um we have so many unanswered
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
questions that he's the only one that
 
00:28:47.399 --> 00:28:49.549 align:start position:0%
questions that he's the only one that
can

00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
answer um representative Harvey bolia
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
Ryan thank you represent presentive Rong
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
for I totally agree um I don't think
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to get anywhere with um a
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
study committee and I don't see anything
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
really wrong with the bill it's just
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
um that I just need to have Mr Wilson
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
here and just what what's the impetus or
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
problem uh why can't he do it on his own
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
anyway but
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I agree thanks for bringing
 
00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:26.310 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I agree thanks for bringing
that

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:38.789 align:start position:0%
that
up

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know if he would be
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
interested but it may be a good idea
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
just to ask the speaker to send Mr
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
Wilson a letter asking him if he can do
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
this without
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
legislation um and maybe you know a
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
letter from the speaker might say that
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
we really want to avoid any legislative
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
remedy we feel that this Falls within
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
the purview of your Division and um
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
could you please tell us if this is
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
something you can do and if so would it
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
come at an additional cost and maybe
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
that way we could get get a response
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
from him um and that might help Drive
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that might happen in the
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
next

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:37.509 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
Rula would you mind weighing
 
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
in thank you okay well it's being
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
relative to having the
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
speaker uh I think
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh my uh speaker has a lot more things
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
to worry about right at the moment than
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
this this issue if anything it would
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
come from the
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
committee I mean you know I obviously
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair right at the moment maybe
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
I'll resign by four at the end of the
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
day but
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know it that we could do that but
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
even then though it
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh it doesn't it that really doesn't
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
to talk to make a decision specifically
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the dis disposition of this
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
is is a is a disposition inorm study is
 
00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:41.070 align:start position:0%
is is a is a disposition inorm study is
a

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
disposition uh well it it there but we
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
have to we have to get to that first
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
what do what would and then we could as
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
part of that we could then uh
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
discuss what the ramifications
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:02.629 align:start position:0%
discuss what the ramifications
afterward

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
now my understanding is that one of the
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
approaches for this could be that we
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
would um model alongside of the marker
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
program that we already have there's um
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
a list that you can
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
download There's a form that you can
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
fill out if you want a revision of a
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
historical marker
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
or you have a problem with what it says
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
and you think it should be removed I
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
mean there's a lot of things about the
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
marker thing that probably wouldn't
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
transfer over so if you wanted to have
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
like we wouldn't be asking communities
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
to take down
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
something when we're talking about
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.549 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
um the issue we have right now that I
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
see is we have have a bill that we know
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
is flawed because it's
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
directing um the wrong Department to
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
handle this okay it's directing the
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
division of archives and Records to do
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
this so that's why this amendment came
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
forward but if we recommend the original
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
Bill be amended with this we already
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
know there's flaws with that because we
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
want more specificity we want to get
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
feedback from the uh the direct dtor of
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources so
 
00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
because if we were just if this
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendment was the
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
bill I think we have more options but we
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
have to pass this amendment before we
 
00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
can really do anything so I'm of the
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
mind that um we recommend interim study
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
a group of us can work together over the
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
summer to craft language of a bill
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
that essentially would be this amendment
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
with addressing some of the issues that
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
have come up in committee or that the
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
interim study group comes up with so
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
that when the next term begins we have a
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
much more a propriate bill that
 
00:34:14.399 --> 00:34:16.030 align:start position:0%
much more a propriate bill that
addresses

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
concerns because see because the thing
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
is we're not really debating the bill
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're debating an amendment that hasn't
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
been accepted
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
yet a inter study is about the only
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
thing we can do um and then hope for the
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
best that that interm study group
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
recommends a a more solid bill in the
 
00:34:38.359 --> 00:34:39.990 align:start position:0%
recommends a a more solid bill in the
next

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
term representative
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
Ryan my understanding is the markers are
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
not monuments that's a they're totally
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking um apples and oranges here
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
so um that's a whole different area that
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right now
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
yes that's right and it's a different it
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
is what they have right now is only for
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
the markers it's not for anything else
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
and as far as just plugging into it we
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't couldn't just plug into it but
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
we would hope I mean we would have heard
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
today how this could have played out
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
should he have been here I think a
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study is something to
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
consider but it's also something to like
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
discuss as a
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.109 align:start position:0%
discuss as a
caucus

00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:30.190 align:start position:0%
caucus
what

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
what
I

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
sorry Brian for clarification could it
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
would an interm study um group be able
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
to go ask the people who are in charge
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
of this task if that was in their scope
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
and sequence yes absolutely and I'm
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
pretty sure we could get mileage for
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
going up there and finding out exactly
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
what they do and seeing how they do
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
it representative Ren Zula uh just uh by
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the original Bill the
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
original Bill call
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
says including physical markers of a
 
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.990 align:start position:0%
says including physical markers of a
historical

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.750 align:start position:0%
historical
event

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.309 align:start position:0%
event
so

00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
markers our part are actually part of it
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
Bill oh
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean the and M M Mr
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
Wilson's uh M Mr Wilson's uh division
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually controls those markers and
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
issues them and uh does all of the you
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
know the work around them so there is a
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
list of that because that's right in his
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
right in his middle of his his
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
ballpark so it's the other stuff that
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions but uh I was um in my phone I
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't on Facebook I was actually
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
looking for the email that Ben Wilson
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
had sent a while back that had some of
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
his thoughts in it and honestly I can't
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
seem to track that down the the first
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
hearing was that in the beginning of
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
February somebody have those emails I
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
representative rang is saying that she
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
has that email
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
Donnelly thank you um it would also be
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
very interesting to hear from the
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
historical societies to get their
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
feedback as to what they think and how
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
much energy that this would take so I I
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
personally would think that would be
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
helpful with the study is to hear from
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh the volunteer organizations and what
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
they think uh the burden of this would
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
be on them and and and what's the
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
process that they would have to follow
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
comply I think that's really important
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
the impact for them they would have a
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
chance to come forward and shape the
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill if it has you know that shaping is
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
needed representative
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
rang I have the email U Madam CH I'll
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
read it it started with an email I sent
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
to Mr Wilson I said Ben could you
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
from archives and Records management to
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources thanks
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
in advance his reply was um in
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
consultation with the bill sponsor we
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
decided there would be no fiscal impact
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
to the division of historical resources
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore no need for a fiscal note
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
the DHR division of historical resources
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
is structurally organized to help
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
develop and maintain this kind of
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
educational tool within our community
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
outreach program thanks for the question
 
00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:05.829 align:start position:0%
outreach program thanks for the question
Ben

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
I think that's really helpful actually
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like he we can do this
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
but we need to know
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
how so we would like him to be more
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
specific um do you have thoughts on what
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative Donnell suggested I mean
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of historical societies and
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
including other people
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
um well my thought is that we have a
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources they
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
can Define what constitutes historical
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's up to us to Define
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
it or to say this Monument is historical
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
or this isn't that's their job to do
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're the
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
professionals let them Define what's
 
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
historical um let them Reach Out I mean
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
there may be a historical society that
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't want anything to do with the
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
state division of historical resources
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
but leave it up to this department to
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
gather the historical resources identify
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
them in the state to the best of their
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
ability and
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
then you know catalog them put them on
 
00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.190 align:start position:0%
then you know catalog them put them on
the

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
website I really don't think this is
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
rocket science but I am troubled that Mr
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
Wilson isn't here to confirm this and
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
that we're relying on an email that was
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
sent on January
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
31st um
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
and you know I mean I think this is a
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea on the part of
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
Representative J's part it's a way we
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
can really support education in the
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
state at no cost it's using the
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
resources that we already have available
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
um but this is what happens when good
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
ideas enter the Sausage Factory of
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
legislation these kind of things you
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
know clog up the mechanism and we have
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
questions here everybody has very valid
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
questions but we don't have the person
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
here to answer them and so I'm really
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
kind of uncomfortable moving
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
forward um on a really good idea when
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
the person who's going to be responsible
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
idea hasn't hasn't been here and so I
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
think that's why I was recommending
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
interim study because we're going to get
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
in the weeds of this of this amendment
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
and and it's not it really shouldn't be
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
up to us it should be up to them to be
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the weeds of this defining I mean so
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that's just my I I
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
think the cleanest and safest way to
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
proceed is just interim study unless by
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
some luck Mr Wilson walks in that door
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
we can address those issues either with
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment maybe we'd have to have
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
another amendment and then it would be
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
you know clean but right now I don't I
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
don't see where we're there
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
there with the executive hearing on
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
November 1st do you think there's any
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
time between now and
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
then possibly I mean
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
could you know the difficult the thing
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
I'm grappling with and maybe it's just a
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
personal thing is we understood from Mr
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
Wilson that he couldn't come last week
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
and so we had it on the agenda for today
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
he said he was available
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
today and and he's not here
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah do we want to have another
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
meeting and and hope he can show up um
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't see how we can do anything
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
without him um and and anything and I'm
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
afraid of us doing anything without him
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
um he's going to be the one to dot the
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
eyes and cross the
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
teas so I I I don't know I guess it it
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
up to it's up to you madam chair
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
chairman Rulo to decide if we want to
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
extend the
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and and try another day
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
where he can be be here to answer the
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions um I do know there were I I'm
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
not sure this amendment as is will fly
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the I think we need to clarify and
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
address some of the concerns we've had
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
especially with other when we mention
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
other um historical
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
groups I don't know but that's that just
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if anybody else has any
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
ideas or if they think we can move
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
forward without Mr Wilson and and fix
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
this I'm not really I don't want to meet
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
again and possibly have them not show
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
up um I mean I love the history bit and
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
I love the promotion of history that
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
that the this behind this bill I mean
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
you can go right on to New Hampshire
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
.gv into the marker site and it pulls
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
up view the New Hampshire historical
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
Highway marker Map There's a list of
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
markers by towns there's a list of
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
markers by marker
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
number um there's a marker Quest form I
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
know they're thinking of more markers
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
than this but uh I don't think there's
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
any dire need to get it done like ASAP
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
because we do have this reference that's
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
very well organized already um under
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
historical resources
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
thanks representative ger what are your
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts about um carrying the bill
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
study thank you very much and I
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the work that you all
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
have have put into this and um I mean I
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
think in the end what I think would
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
happen is a study would result
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
effectively in this um and and I say
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
that because I wrote this working with
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
Mr Wilson and the frustration of course
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
is that he he isn't here so the language
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's here uh first of all I I have to
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
say again
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
that in in all fairness with my friends
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
and colleagues I'm a little frustrated
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
with the expressions of concern about
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
this being open-ended it's simply not it
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
refers specifically to public monuments
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
maintained at public expense that is a
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
finite List It exists in every Community
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
because they already do it it it
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
involves no further Gathering of
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
information it is not a nebulous
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
category it is an existing defined
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
Universe of
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
objects uh so um and again that was
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
written in consultation with with Mr
 
00:45:52.319 --> 00:45:54.190 align:start position:0%
written in consultation with with Mr
Wilson

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
Wilson
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
um some of the other language issues
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
again in terms of flexibility I don't
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
the bill does not require the department
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
to work with any particular entity in
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
any municipality so whether that's a
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
historical sitey again that was um and I
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand we don't have Mr Wilson here
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
but that was in you know working with
 
00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
him because they have relationships with
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
communities so I wasn't going to direct
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
them that specifically they had to work
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
with a historical society or they had to
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
work with a particular Department in
 
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.390 align:start position:0%
work with a particular Department in
certain

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh they have those
 
00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
resources um and we have unfortunately
 
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
only an email at this point uh but to
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
indicate that there is no Financial cost
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
so I'm also as I think you probably
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
would be in my case a little frustrated
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
at the concern about the cost when the
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
department has said that this fits
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
within what they already do I'm not
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
really sure what the point of asking a
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
department is uh for a fiscal note if
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
then the response is going to be well we
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
don't believe you when you say that
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal note so
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
um and and I and I I apologize for for
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
being blunt but we're all colleagues and
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
those are just my uh reactions I don't
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
really think a study committee is going
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
to result in anything other than than
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
what we have here I think what we have
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
is um unfortunately that the director
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to confirm what as it said
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
this language was written specifically
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that it would not have a fysical
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
impact so that it would be done in a way
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
that fits within work that the
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
department already does and so that's of
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
course a source of my frustration and
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
there is no as we mentioned last time
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
there is no enforcement right in the end
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
this is voluntary there you know the
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
department isn't going to chase anybody
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
down they're not going to expend extra
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
resources to do that uh so it is
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately voluntary the reason why it
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
was uh I wrote it as as a bill that
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
would go into statute as opposed to
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
Simply uh seeing if the department could
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
could do this
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
you know on its own was the maintaining
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
it every 10 years right that that would
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
be the statutory implication here U so
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
that is and I am entirely uh in you know
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
I'd love to work with the Department to
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
help them do uh more in this area so to
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
me it's not that the activity itself per
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
se has to be in statute but it's the
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's done every 10
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
years uh is the part that's important to
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
me so again I want to thank you all for
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
the time and effort that you put into it
 
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
I share your frustration that
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we haven't been able to he
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
director representative Ryan can we
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
approve the
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that seems to clarify no what
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
the questions that we had from the
 
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.910 align:start position:0%
the questions that we had from the
original

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
Bill Mr chair do you care to weigh in on
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
that procedural
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
question right but the amendment it's
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment itself would off have to
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
be approved by the full committee uh but
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh but there's I think the amendment
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
itself uh clears up an original problem
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
that was that was noted at the very
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
beginning but uh whether an amendment is
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
there or not there's still problems and
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's really I think what we
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
were hearing for those additional
 
00:49:34.109 --> 00:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
Wilson please would it be feasible and I
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
understand if the answer is no uh with
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
the session that you have coming up
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
right on November 1st if you were to and
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
I I absolutely get you know we we don't
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to do anything which depends on the
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
director being here um because we've
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
already gone down that road twice uh but
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
if he were to confirm to the committee
 
00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.470 align:start position:0%
if he were to confirm to the committee
in

00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
writing again what he had said earlier
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
in the year I understand months have
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
gone by things may well have changed but
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
if he were able to confirm that as
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
amended which again is based on the
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
conversations I had with him that this
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
is something that they can do with the
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
resources that they
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
have is it possible then to have the
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee on November first vote to
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
approve the amendment and then have a
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
vote over whether or not to approve the
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
amended Bill if and again that would be
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
if uh the director responds with a
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
confirmation that there are no
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
required representative run I think
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's a very good idea because we've
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
never received any testimony from Mr
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
Wilson um all we have is this email so I
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
think why not why not just ask him if he
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
would write a letter of testimony to
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
submit to the committee um when we have
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
our executive session um about this
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
amendment if if he's in favor of it if
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
he's not in favor of it and if
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
he uh can make a statement regarding any
 
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:15.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and then we're going to be
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
an executive session anyway we can then
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
vote to uh approve the amendment and
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
then vote for the bill as amended
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
because I really think the sticking
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
point at least with me is we don't have
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
anything from directly from him um and
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
when you look at all the bills that come
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
through our committee we always have at
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
least written testimony if not also oral
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Department that's
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
impacted so I think if we can get that
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
testimony from him at least written for
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
the executive committee um I would be
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
fine with that but without that
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
Department's statement
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
Bill representative Ryan and then
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative Healey would that excuse
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
me thank you would that satisfy um
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
representative R's concerns about the
 
00:52:10.359 --> 00:52:12.470 align:start position:0%
representative R's concerns about the
original

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:20.510 align:start position:0%
original
Bill

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
no the only thing I was going to say he
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
if he could also just include what he's
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to win include in this how far
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
down he's going to go like you said so
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
he would Define the scope is that what
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
you mean representative Healey Define
 
00:52:32.799 --> 00:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
you mean representative Healey Define
scope

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
yep did you put down what you know what
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
was the need for the
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill exactly um if there was a reason
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
why he can't do it already I think you
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
before representative run uh chairman
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
Rulo at that executive committee um the
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
ex excutive session would he be able to
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
be called on by you to answer any
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
clarification really thinking about
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
this technically
 
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
yes but it's almost but I'm at the point
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
now where having gone twice
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
position I mean I'm not I I feel that
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm maybe getting to the point
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
allowances how many how much more allow
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
how many more allowances can we
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
have we can we have a situation where
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
nobody bothers to
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
testify but they'll just send in a
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
letter and and then when we get when the
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
letter is is when there's issues well
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
well then they come up and
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
testify that such a bad
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman I totally agree with
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
you on that but I'm also
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
weighing weighing the advantages of
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
getting this addressed and taken care of
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
because it is a really good idea and I
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
know our our
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
teachers all throughout the state would
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
really appreciate having this resource
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
and knowing that at least every 10 years
 
00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:35.150 align:start position:0%
and knowing that at least every 10 years
it's

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
updated so I think the benefit of having
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
this pass
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
outweighs the sense
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
of discomfort there's a feeling I have
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
between discomfort and disrespect about
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
not being able to have this kind of
 
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
testimony so I agree with you but I but
 
00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
when you are thinking about it just
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
think about the benefit this will
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
state well I think about
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
everybody who comes to
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
testify to this committee and other
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
committees that you know we have a
 
00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
committees that you know we have a
process

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
and at some
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
point pushing the envelope the envelope
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
breaks and I think that you have to step
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
back and say well do we want to set a
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
precedent that we can that we can
 
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.549 align:start position:0%
precedent that we can that we can
allow

00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh The Lax
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
Behavior to
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh that there has to be some kind
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
of push back against it so I'm going to
 
00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
that representative Donnell thank you I
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Rulo if you
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
open this the doorways to uh you know
 
00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:10.510 align:start position:0%
open this the doorways to uh you know
the

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
uh not showing sending letters it does
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
open the doorway for others because it
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
does set a president so it's uh we all
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
took our time to be here today so it
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
would have been quite nice to see him
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
yes it would have I agree
 
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.549 align:start position:0%
yes it would have I agree
[Music]

00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I I really would have a hard
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
time iing this
 
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill but to move to getting me on that I
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
mean the other options are
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
studies which may not bring us
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
to getting the information from the
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
expert that we you know the person that
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
in the department that this really
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
affects so I
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of at an impass with it I don't
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
want to see it go itl but I know that if
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
we did an interim study that the fact
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we would study it would really be
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
the only procedural difference between
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
study

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to be my optimistic
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
self and I'm going to expect that at our
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
executive session we have a very nice
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
letter from Mr Wilson outlining the
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
impact this amendment would have on his
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
Department um the benefits if there are
 
00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
any costs or disadvantages to it but we
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
really get an official Department
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
statement and our committee has made a
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
very bright people I think we could read
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
that and understand if we should move
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
ahead to accept the amendment and then
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
pass the bill as amended so I I think
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that let's let's um
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
bring it to the executive session I
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
think as far as the subcommittee
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
goes um we are
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
recommending I think do we have to take
 
00:58:27.069 --> 00:58:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
no so I think we just let's leave it up
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
to the full committee and if and if we
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
have a letter and if it's acceptable to
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
the committee and the committee decides
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to accept the amendment and
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
pass the bill as amended then we're good
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
to go but if we we don't have
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with that letter that the
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
the division is in support of this then
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
um then at that
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
time I would I would recommend itl
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
and wait for it to come back the
 
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.069 align:start position:0%
and wait for it to come back the
following

00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
term it would be the same procedurally
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then we wouldn't be obligating the
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor and all of us to continue to
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
work on something just simply because we
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the information and we we're
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
not getting it right
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
away um and I understand um I want to
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
just address what representative branula
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
was saying yes we would not want people
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
to send in letters and not come in and
 
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
testify but we should take what we have
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
right now deal with the work that's
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
before us and vote objectively on the
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
information and not you know in do
 
00:59:33.599 --> 00:59:34.710 align:start position:0%
information and not you know in do
anything

00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
punitive which would be to you know to
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
me no there's no rush on this but kids
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
grow up and they go away and this is a
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
family activity at a time when you know
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
there's just so many things that can be
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
done with this Monument list that I
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
think would be really powerful that
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to wait if we can do
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
something less last minute and just see
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
what the rest of the committee said I
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem with this 10 to
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
10 and having to work it out on the
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
floor either so and I just say that
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
because we're procedurally up against
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
the wall we want the bill but we can't
 
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.230 align:start position:0%
the wall we want the bill but we can't
get

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:17.799 align:start position:0%
there go ahead represent yeah I just I
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make one statement clear I
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
really really support this but I think
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
as the committee any any committee it's
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
really important for us to understand
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
directly from the Department uh any
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
division um what their responses to
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
actions we take
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
legislatively um I don't think I could
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
ever consider a bill that impacts let's
 
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
say Dees without Dees weighing in on it
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes we override there what what
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
the comments they make if if they are
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation it doesn't we're
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
not rubber stamping what they have but I
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
just think what the the a bet the worst
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
president I see here is passing a bill
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
that impacts a division without getting
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
input from that division on that impact
 
01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
and that goes across the board for any
 
01:01:14.359 --> 01:01:18.990 align:start position:0%
and that goes across the board for any
standing

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee go ahead represent go ahead
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative hey and I would put out
 
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
one more um request that you show up on
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
the 1 if he can just in case we do have
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
any questions again so you know you
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
though he puts this letter out there may
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
be questions that come out of that
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
letter so I would say if he can make it
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
on the first put that uh invitation out
 
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.549 align:start position:0%
on the first put that uh invitation out
to

01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
that I do think that we should invite
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
him to the first we have to exec the
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
bill either way if he's here and we want
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
to ask questions of him then that would
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
be an
 
01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.190 align:start position:0%
be an
opportunity

01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
um but I think we've gone as far as we
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
can without you know that exactly what
 
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
you said the agency needs to weigh in we
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
in motion to adjourn do we have a second
 
01:02:22.279 --> 01:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
in motion to adjourn do we have a second
second

01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
