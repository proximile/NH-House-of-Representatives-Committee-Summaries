you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:39.840 --> 00:02:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.840 --> 00:03:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.840 --> 00:07:28.469 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we'll open up the
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
work uh session on
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
hb680 uh there's a continued work
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
session from the previous
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
meeting we met on monday ago and
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
we will try to continue where we were on
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
the bill in going through the initial
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
presentation of that bill that we were
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh we had dropped off at page
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
14 are there abouts
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
well i think we think we actually
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
finished up through the accountability
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
section i mean yeah we were we did get
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
we did get through
 
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.430 align:start position:0%
we did get through
um

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
were we on page
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
top of page 16 or
 
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.710 align:start position:0%
top of page 16 or
our

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we did get through uh the
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
whole bill but i don't think we spent a
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
lot of time on sections 15 and 16 on on
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you know and i think it's it's worth
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
spending a few minutes talking about
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe while we're while we're
 
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.230 align:start position:0%
that maybe while we're while we're
waiting

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so mike i'm wondering if you can
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
what happens if
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
these turnaround plans
 
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
these turnaround plans
get

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.509 align:start position:0%
 
developed

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
the goals are not met so so there's
 
00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.150 align:start position:0%
the goals are not met so so there's
there's

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the accountability
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
sections margarine thanks
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
um that are designed to be
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know punitive or pejorative to um to
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
any school district
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.070 align:start position:0%
and and um
and

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's important i think that that
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
what um what we do as a state and and
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
and conducted obviously through the
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
that they're able to collect information
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can you know maybe
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
even down the road more accurately
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
measure student performance
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
and right now the data that we have are
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
basically the how students perform on
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
the statewide assessment tests
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
and attendance and graduation rates
 
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.190 align:start position:0%
and attendance and graduation rates
and

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
graduation rates are certainly important
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know in terms of how how school
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
districts are
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
performing so our attendance rates too
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
and and you know it's it's you know i
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
think we're fortunate that a lot of us
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
on this committee have been members of
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
school boards before
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
and um and certainly i recall our
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent saying all the time that
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
time is the currency of education
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and so the amount of time spent
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
in school um you know uh you know with
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh with you know teachers providing
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
instruction um
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh and with your classmates is uh is is
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
really important so so
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
so the the factors that are currently
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
being used in in 1680 as far as
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
measuring student performance basically
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
the tests attendance and uh and
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
graduation rates
 
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
graduation rates
um

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.550 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
the top part of
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
of uh and i want to try to find the
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
page that we're on
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
page 11 and 12
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so that top part
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
um starting on page i think
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
nine and going into ten really talks
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
about um you know data that the uh that
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the department uh uh could be collecting
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh to um you know to help um determine
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
how uh how students are doing in in
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
districts across the state and then uh
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
the part that you're talking about
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
really begins i think in section 11 at
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page 10
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about um
 
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about um
uh

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
schools the basically the bottom twenty
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
percent of school districts would be um
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh would be
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know considered to be
 
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:10.870 align:start position:0%
you know considered to be
underperforming

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
underperforming
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
and and again this isn't this isn't
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
trying to be punitive it's really trying
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
to trying to find ways where we can
 
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.629 align:start position:0%
to trying to find ways where we can
support

00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.710 align:start position:0%
support
administrations

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
administrations
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and you know we've heard a lot about in
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
the committee too about things like best
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
practice folders and stuff like that but
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
support the administration in being able
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
to um to
 
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.829 align:start position:0%
to um to
help

00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know improve students whether it's
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
performance on tests or or graduation
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
rates and attendance rates
 
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.150 align:start position:0%
rates and attendance rates
and

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
my experience
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
has been that
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the school where i taught
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
which was always called underperforming
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
was that we were always trying to
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
improve and
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
we focused all the time on
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
making those indicators go up and we
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
worked really hard at that so that other
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
things kind of got left behind yeah and
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
and maybe my experience is
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
worry about it i worry about calling
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
schools underperforming and
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
and and making them have an improvement
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
plan that
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
may or may not
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
really be implemented well or may have a
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
change in
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
leadership i know we lost
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
superintendents for a while we were
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
saying we had a superintendent of the
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
week because we hadn't didn't have a
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent for longer than a year at
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
a time
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
all those things come in um
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
but aren't
 
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.230 align:start position:0%
but aren't
necessarily

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.910 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
credited and so the blame comes down to
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
the classroom teacher and i just feel
 
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.269 align:start position:0%
the classroom teacher and i just feel
like

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.629 align:start position:0%
like
then

00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's the other ones that are striving
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
so hard to meet all their kids needs and
 
00:14:04.949 --> 00:14:04.959 align:start position:0%
i know i get emotional because i just
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
feel like there's a
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
and i know maybe this is not the
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
function of this committee but
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
somehow or other we have to make sure
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the people who are working in those
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
underperforming schools where the kids
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
growing the way they're supposed to grow
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we understand that that's not for
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
lack of effort on behalf of the people
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
who are working with those children
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
and that there's other things that can
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
influence how well a child performs
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
that's out of the control of uh
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
of the local school
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i think there are two categories
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
of quote unquote underperforming schools
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
mandated in federal law in the essa
 
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
mandated in federal law in the essa
program

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's part of that's coming
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
down i think it dates back to no child
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
left behind sure um so you know that's
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
that's a federal requirement so there's
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
not much we can do about it we have to
 
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
not much we can do about it we have to
comply

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
comply
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
with that provision and i think that
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.629 align:start position:0%
there's um
uh

00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
percentages in terms of was it percent
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
and ten percent something like that uh
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
to define whether a
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
school is in
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
category one or two which i think
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
i think they're still called tsi and csi
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
so so i i think with this bill and i
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying marjorie and and
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
glenn that you know what we're
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know there there certainly are
 
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.870 align:start position:0%
you know there there certainly are
requirements

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
at through um through through sf
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
um and no child and formerly no child
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
left behind but the the most important
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
thing about house bill 1680 is that it's
 
00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.710 align:start position:0%
thing about house bill 1680 is that it's
designed

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
designed
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
right at the top
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
to establish
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
a a foundation opportunity budget
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
so that a school district can educate
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
all of its students to a statewide
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
outcome which is a really strong outcome
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
in in new hampshire
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
right now that's not how school
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
districts are
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
are financed and funded in in new
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire so so the access to resources
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the hillsborough deering district
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
have are very different than the access
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
to resources that other districts across
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
the state have like let's just pick
 
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.389 align:start position:0%
the state have like let's just pick
lincoln

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
lincoln
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
um you know for instance
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
and um and and frankly they're they're
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're different than than the access
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
to resources that um that we might have
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
in hopkinton i mean which also has high
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
property tax rates um
 
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:39.269 align:start position:0%
property tax rates um
so

00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.389 align:start position:0%
so
so

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
so by by by starting with a a foundation
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget plan
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
designed so that so that the
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
hillsborough deering district can
 
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
educate their kids to a statewide
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
average outcome the hopkinton kids can
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
the homeland district can educate it
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
kids its kids to a statewide average
 
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.870 align:start position:0%
kids its kids to a statewide average
outcome

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh will uh will
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
go i think a lot further
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
for um uh
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know in making sure that under
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
districts are so being supported by the
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
state and i'm not saying being supported
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
by by well you know you know you should
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
get rid of all your teachers or you
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
should you know
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
do this and do that administratively but
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
but getting the financial support they
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
need to be able to meet to be able to
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
have you know have a realistic budget
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
and um and so that's what the whole
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill is about when
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
we're when we're getting to this part
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
marjorie um
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
and this is important to talk about the
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
accountability doesn't even come in
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
until two years after the first part of
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
comes in and i'm not saying that our
 
00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:49.590 align:start position:0%
comes in and i'm not saying that our
current

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
accountability standard is necessarily
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
the right way to be measuring uh schools
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
but but we understand that it's going to
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
take time and it's probably going to
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
take more than two years time
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
um for um you know for for uh student
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes to uh to begin to move in the
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
direction that the opportu that the
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.029 align:start position:0%
direction that the opportu that the
foundation

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan um predicts they will
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh i i'd like to just kick in here
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about the policy
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
and accountability portions of this and
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important that we also
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
be looking at 193e
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh 3
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
where we have correct
 
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
where we have correct
corrective

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
corrective
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
and technical assistance provided to
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
districts which aren't achieving what
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
they need to with many of these
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
subgroups within
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
targeted monies and and when i say
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
targeted i say it very
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
with quotes around because it's really
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
not targeted money as we have right now
 
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.390 align:start position:0%
not targeted money as we have right now
and

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
look at if you're in corrective and
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
technical assistance in the third year
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
it gives the commissioner education
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're under current law right now
 
00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.870 align:start position:0%
we're under current law right now
to

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
assess the schools how they're spending
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
their funds are the funds being directed
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
towards the purpose of those funds
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
but that's only in the third year
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
that that is it says to require the
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
school to provide an accounting of how
 
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
funds are being used to provide the
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate uh education
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
assess how the school is expanding its
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
educational funds and may order the
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy funds be redirected to address
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
those areas that are
 
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.390 align:start position:0%
those areas that are
failing

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
failing
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and won't read anymore so that's in
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
current law right now i
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
i oftentimes ask the department how how
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
often do you get to this point
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
where we see that the
 
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the gap between some of the students
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
who are in these subgroups is getting
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
larger between those that are achieving
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
those or not
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that is a significant certain
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
concern i know of the commissioner and
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the department right now
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
so i anything which we do pass that has
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
this in here
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
like i'm looking on page 12
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
line 16-17 where you're talking for
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
about persistent disparities which are
 
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.350 align:start position:0%
about persistent disparities which are
reflective

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
reflective
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
it says establish statewide targets for
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
addressing persistent uh disparities
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
and you develop this plan
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.789 align:start position:0%
and you develop this plan
i

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
anything that we do
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to really have some
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
some language inserted that really gives
 
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.230 align:start position:0%
some language inserted that really gives
the

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner the opportunity the ie the
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
department to target those monies where
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
and i'd i'd look at 193e
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
and and do the comparison to make sure
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
because there was some good stuff
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be was being
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
done or not i can't say
 
00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:52.070 align:start position:0%
done or not i can't say
so

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to put this in
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not arguing with people and i'm not
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
finding fault but
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
what if the way to close these gaps
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
is to get rid of the lead pipes
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
leading into the homes in the town
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
because this kids
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
have a high level of lead
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
in their water
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
or what if the way to get rid of these
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
gaps is to provide
 
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
gaps is to provide
um

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
preschool

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
preschool
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
universal preschool
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
to all the students in the district so
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
that kids entering kindergarten
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
are all entering
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
at about the same starting line
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
what if those are the things that are
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
needed is it
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay so those are the kinds so those
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
could potentially
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
enter into
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
um the money that the district receives
 
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.029 align:start position:0%
um the money that the district receives
to

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about representative
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
porter is exactly what i've always
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
screamed about
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
what is the aspiration of the community
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
what is the shape of the family what is
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
this you know all those issues which are
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
ones where you can throw a lot of money
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
at something and it's not necessarily
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
going to touch and achieve what you're
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
trying to do there are a lot of issues
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
that money can resolve but there's some
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that it can't you know the it's it's
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's almost like culture
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
so i i i concur with you
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh however there
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
there are situations that we all know of
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
that if the
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
the instruction may be matched more the
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
learning style of the student and we get
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
those two things on the same level so
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
instruction can be teaching one way and
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
the child learns a totally different way
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
those are all
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
in every school we've had in services
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
and time for teachers to understand that
 
00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:55.029 align:start position:0%
and time for teachers to understand that
and

00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
we want to be looking at that component
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
as well as we want to be looking at the
 
00:22:59.039 --> 00:22:59.909 align:start position:0%
as well as we want to be looking at the
the

00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
those other issues that you're speaking
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
to representative porter there's a whole
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
lot comes together in trying to see how
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
to close these gaps
 
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.630 align:start position:0%
to close these gaps
so

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
can i can i jump in here for a comment
 
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
can i can i jump in here for a comment
um

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
accountability is good
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
i mean accountability in and of itself
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
is a good thing because it allows us to
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
sort of trace the dime in the dollar and
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the outcomes that we want
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
are the outcomes that we're getting what
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
i think this bill does in a way that uh
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
is frankly exciting to me is when when
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
you talk
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
about the school improvement plans and
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
the persistent disparities
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
it actually spells out what the process
 
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.230 align:start position:0%
it actually spells out what the process
is

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
should those disparities be uncovered
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'm looking on page 12 section roman 2
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
line 21.
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
that section starts with uh
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
districts establishing targets for
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
addressing persistent disparities
 
00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:06.549 align:start position:0%
addressing persistent disparities
and

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
it tells you what has to happen not what
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
we want to happen but what has to happen
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
that each district shall develop an
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based three-year plan that each
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
district shall be developed by the
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent in consultation with the
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
school board and shall consider input
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
shall consider input and recommendations
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
from parents other relative
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
community stakeholders
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
special education english learner parent
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
advisory council school improvement
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
councils i mean i think that
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
utilizing the brain trust to do the
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
finances is part one
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
but coming up with a solution that we
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
can at least all get on board with on
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do when we uncover
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to uncover is part
 
00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:57.029 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to uncover is part
two

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
and i i don't want that to get lost
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
because of the price tag
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
not that we've got an unlimited amount
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
of funds obviously we don't and that's
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
why we're all sitting here but uh
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
but i do think that there is
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
accountability in this bill that is very
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
clearly spelled out
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that was very
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
helpful you're right i have not
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
spent enough time cruising all the
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
different little parts that are in here
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
but yes so something that's also part of
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
that accountability is that is is and
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
and we we don't have that in in our
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
current this in our current statute
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
is um is the connection
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
of of student outcomes through
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
accountability because it's met you can
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
measure these things
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
performance on statewide tests
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
ascendance graduate rate graduation
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
rates plus down the road additional
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
metrics can be can be considered but but
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
how that feedbacks feeds back into
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
the the funding formula
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
as it's reevaluated at least every 10
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
years at least no less frequently than
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
and um and and because of the the
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know the method the statistic
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
basically a statistical method of
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
analyzing what what um school districts
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
how they're spending their money what
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're spending money on and what their
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
student outcomes are
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
that can be
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
that that's a very tight feedback loop
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
with with accountability
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
and and so now really for the first time
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
accountability gets some gets put right
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
into the the system of how you go about
 
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
into the the system of how you go about
costing

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
costing
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
a foundation opportunity budget that
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
closes these opportunity gaps for uh for
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
students in the uh in the state
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli i did think of
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
you repeatedly as i was reading this
 
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.789 align:start position:0%
you repeatedly as i was reading this
bill

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
bill
yes

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
and quite surprising one might say but
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
the references to parent involvement in
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
this in this bill which i know is
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
something that is near and dear to you
 
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.950 align:start position:0%
something that is near and dear to you
um

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
i i i mean i i
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
i applaud you representative luno for
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
the number of times in the variety of
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
ways that you were able to
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
sort of put a highlighter over the need
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
to get community involvement in
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
total ownership of the school plan in
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
really do what
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative ladd and representative
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
porter are talking about and that is
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
meet the specific needs of a community
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
not just a sort of the
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
generic needs right right and not just
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
at budget time not just when you're
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
voting at the school district meeting
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
but um but when considering how your how
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
students are performing and and what um
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
i mean this is more than just
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
aspirational this is
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know i think this is what what
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
voters have expected for a long time in
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and why
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
um why new hampshire has such good
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
student outcomes
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
well i think that the the flight path
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
you're talking about with the benchmarks
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
along the way towards achieving those
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
academic standards which are set by the
 
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
academic standards which are set by the
state

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
now how we do it
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
is set by the local
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
so what we've got to do is ensure that
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is our specific benchmarks as you
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
allude to represent mullen along the way
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
that give us the metric give us the
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
information that's needed to say
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're on course or we're not on course
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
and no matter how you slice and dice
 
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.909 align:start position:0%
and no matter how you slice and dice
this

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be strong
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
supervision there's going to have to be
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
strong alignment between what is being
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
taught and those academic standards that
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
we have set
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
we're measuring our achievement based
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
upon standards which are in a given
 
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:05.269 align:start position:0%
upon standards which are in a given
instrument

00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
instrument
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
if that instrument's not measuring what
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
our academic styles are properly we've
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
got to get on top of that too and that's
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
where the course the repeal to repeal
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
the in oversight committee is very
 
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.789 align:start position:0%
the in oversight committee is very
important

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
but i believe that
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
if all this has to be connected
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
and and they're going to be those hard
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
times in a school where you see that the
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
school may be teaching something which
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
is not part of not going towards that
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
academic standard that's you may have
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
good teachers but teachers that are not
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the same page as that academic
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
standard is that's where that
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
supervision is critical
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
and supervision can come in from the we
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
refer to that as the thinning of the
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
garden in bedford representative ladd
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
and it has i can guarantee you that it
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
has not always been a popular approach
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
because it means that some people's
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
favorite units of study
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm aware of the fact that we
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
had a unit of study on corn in bedford
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in the elementary schools
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
and it was fascinating and it was fun
 
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.350 align:start position:0%
and it was fascinating and it was fun
and

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
it had to go
 
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.870 align:start position:0%
it had to go
because

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
the outcomes from you know the outcomes
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
that were being measured and the
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
benchmarks that were being uh attempted
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the unit
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
were a mismatch they're not matching and
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
i believe as the school principal for so
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
many years i had to watch out for that
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we had a number of field trips going
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
out sometimes the field trips were one
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
so wonderful socially and all that but
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
no relationship to
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and there's only x
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
number of days in the school year and if
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
you sacrifice 10 to do these wonderful
 
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
you sacrifice 10 to do these wonderful
things

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
go and watch the red sox play baseball
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i can see that matches up with a pe
 
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.149 align:start position:0%
yeah i can see that matches up with a pe
type

00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
standard somewhere along the way so but
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that what we should be doing um
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
so right right and and and what you're
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
saying there rick about how
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
how um
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
how how spending gets tied to outcomes
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
to student performance
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's um that's something that's uh
 
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.870 align:start position:0%
that's um that's something that's uh
that

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's sort of tied in with the
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
efficiency um
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know of of how districts spend money
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
and and also it's it's uh it's tied in
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
with the information that um that air uh
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
analyzed when they were looking at how
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
districts across the state do spend
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
money and we talked a little bit about
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
this last week
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
districts that tend to have
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
have fewer resources tighter budgets
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
tend to spend money more efficiently
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
than um than than districts that don't
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
that that actually comes out in the in
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
the in the evidence statewide
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
and um and when looking at the data you
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
can actually sort of see what what sort
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
of um spending categories or or what
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
sort of spending doesn't manifest itself
 
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.950 align:start position:0%
sort of spending doesn't manifest itself
in

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
student outcomes the way other um
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
budgeted line items you know spending uh
 
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:23.350 align:start position:0%
budgeted line items you know spending uh
does

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
and um and i think that's what um
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
what's really what what what sue
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
referenced in on page 12
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
section 13 line 23 evidence space 3 or
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
plan to meet its targets so you're
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
really having a targeted student outcome
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
and make sure that you're spending um
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
your budget is aligned with um with
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
achieving those outcomes
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead would that relate then
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh infamous doe 25 form and what's being
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
reported to the state um
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
making sure that it can take
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that it has that level of
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
detail to determine that absolutely
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
let's uh take advantage of we got uh doe
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
hats arrived at our doorstep
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
and welcome mark
 
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.669 align:start position:0%
and welcome mark
um

00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.789 align:start position:0%

oliver

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
i was just listening very much and
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
getting educated on the academic
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
perspective of this i wonder if maybe
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's an element that might be better
 
00:33:35.679 --> 00:33:38.070 align:start position:0%
there's an element that might be better
considered

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
in the health
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
and property value and those kinds of
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
issues if you were to give this
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
performance thing and there were at
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
least an implicit or maybe explicit
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
connection between the lead pipes that
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative porter was talking about
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
and the health and mental acuity of
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
students that it might be shifted at
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
least into higher community interest and
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
maybe more of an imperative and
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
therefore you could achieve not just the
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
school system not having lead pipes but
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
making the town
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
agree that nobody should have lead pipes
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
and that way you can begin to achieve
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
that objective
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
but with more direct community
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
involvement yes the person selling their
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
house is going to howl
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
of course they don't want to have any
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
more restrictions but the fact of the
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
matter if you can't sell your house
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
until you've changed the pipes then
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
you've changed one unit in town no
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
matter what the aquifer might be or
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
where the source of the alien might
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
eventually be traced to you could get
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
the appropriate state officials in to
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
determine that and then move from that
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
point just a thought
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
if you um representative ford if you
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
look at page 11 roman 4 starting on line
 
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.669 align:start position:0%
look at page 11 roman 4 starting on line
28

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
28
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
i think you're going to find that it
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of exactly what you're
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
saying it talks about
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
the social services and health needs of
 
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
the social services and health needs of
students

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
child welfare expanding law enforcement
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
as necessary
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
workforce development there's a whole
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
section in there that i think is is
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
exactly bull's-eyed in on what you're
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i i understood that part but
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
what i was really responding to is i
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
heard you all talking and you were sort
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
of taking the blame on the school system
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
and then trying to deal with it and i'm
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
saying it's not all us folks
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
other people need to take part of the
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
blame too
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
i think we got to be very careful before
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:40.550 align:start position:0%
i think we got to be very careful before
we

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
do a lot of subjective type stuff here
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
um there are districts right beside each
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
other in the direct opposite polar
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
polarized from each other you know and
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the same condition
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh so there are a lot of factors there
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
are multiple factors which come into
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
what is achievement what is growth
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that what you got to do is
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
incorporate all those factors as
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
conditions and they may weigh
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
differently with different districts
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
so there is that uniqueness where local
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
control and and everything's different
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
every valley in this state has a
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
different way of doing something it's
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
kind of unfortunate in one way but
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
another way it's kind of wonderful that
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's still new hampshire
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
so let's go on and get involved here
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
with the next part mark and and and dave
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
and let's let's go jump beyond the the
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
page which we've been on with 12 and and
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
13 and start talking on the top of you
 
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
13 and start talking on the top of you
know

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.190 align:start position:0%
know
the

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
page 14 when you start talking things
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
like the statewide education property
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
tax and getting on to specifics
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'm curious to know
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
about and and i'll explain it is that
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
how we come up with what is the average
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
cost or the cost you're saying shows
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we're at the performance level we
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
have to be what is that dollar figure
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
how did we get that dollar figure
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
from the doe 25
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
and and so that whole conversation we
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to have somewhere along the way
 
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
have to have somewhere along the way
here

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
so let's start with page 14 or so and
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
move onwards i think it was about that
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
where we stopped somewhere where we we
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
had some information on statewide
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
education property tax that was provided
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
earlier um
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
we can start there or we could even leap
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
and go on on some of the other pages
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
which yeah so let me um
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
let me take an after fact um could we
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
invite um representative ames sure to uh
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
to take us through the um um the uh the
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
revenue and um
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and the and the swept um
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
before before we take tackle that rick
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
you asked a really big question about
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
how do you determine what the um what
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
the district budgets are to to
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
to you know to achieve
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh a certain outcome performance level
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
in a in a school district and um and
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
that is done through uh through
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
and uh and it was done through um
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
using uh
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
really using 10 years worth of
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
doe you know data collected by every
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
district and connecting it with the with
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the average student outcomes in each of
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
these districts
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
so what i'd what i would suggest we we
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
may want to do and uh whether we do it
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
next week or do it at some point down
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
the road is um is maybe hear from the
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
people that that did that analysis and
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
they can they can really get into um to
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
exactly how that's done but it's
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
basically looking at formulas that that
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
that contain
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
student characteristics like like you
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
know the the number of english language
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
learners the number of students on ieps
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
the number of students free and reduced
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
prices there's a whole discussion there
 
00:39:04.079 --> 00:39:04.790 align:start position:0%
prices there's a whole discussion there
and

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
i'm with you on that i think that would
 
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
be uh we need to have that discussion
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah uh let's take advantage of the
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
folks we have right now with dick and
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
mark right and and and get this
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
explanation here let's get it down to
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
about 15 000 foot sounds good all right
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
so we're i think rick you've moved us uh
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
just beyond adequacy i mean beyond the
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
accountability section to the top of of
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
page 14
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
where we talk about the
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax i think
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
we touched on it a little bit
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh last week
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
with representative ames and attorney
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
artinger and um and maybe we can sort of
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
start where uh where we left off uh
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
there and and then go through um
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
go through how um
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the effect on um on
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
charter schools and um and and basically
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
per pupil funding and then going into
 
00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:09.109 align:start position:0%
per pupil funding and then going into
the

00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
welcome dick
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i actually didn't expect to be
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
sitting up here because
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem but i feel like
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
another chair that's more comfortable
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
i've got several in the back that's not
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
it i
 
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.190 align:start position:0%
it i
i

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to go ahead with the property
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
tax statewide property tax issue i
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
thought we had covered a good part of
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
that last time
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
um i had a handout that i
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
i gave to you all i dropped my papers
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
back there so it was hard to find things
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
that the sections that relate to
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
reform of the statewide education
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
property tax reform
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
are also in another bill
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
that bill has been processed by the
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
house ways and means committee
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
was re it was uh reported out it was
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
retained studied
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
reported out with a
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation for interim study and the
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
house acted on that
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
putting it into interim study with ways
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
and means
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
in january
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
so that's where
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
where that
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
and those provisions sit on the ways of
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
means study i would on the side on the
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
net ways on the inside
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
i would say that the uh
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know it was really unanimous felt
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
that this was an important
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
provision that
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
would bring a greater degree of
 
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
would bring a greater degree of
relief

00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
to property taxpayers
 
00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.670 align:start position:0%
to property taxpayers
than

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
has been there before and
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
that relief is enabled by the reform of
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
the statewide property tax
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
basically bringing into play
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
resources sufficient to provide
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
substantial relief to
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers from
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
not just the statewide education
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
which is a low rate
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
but also from the school tax
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
itself the local school tax so both
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
of those rates as applied to a
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
particular homeowner's property produce
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
a cost to the
 
00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:40.710 align:start position:0%
a cost to the
taxpayer

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that cost is what
 
00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.150 align:start position:0%
and that cost is what
is

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
that cost will be relieved in some
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
fashion depending on the homeowner's
 
00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:53.589 align:start position:0%
fashion depending on the homeowner's
circumstances

00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
through this bill so that's that's
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's a 30 000 foot level
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
description of this we can go into
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
details but i'm not sure that you should
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh spend much time on those details up
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
to you of course
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
basically it's raising uh income levels
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
for eligibility from where they are in
 
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.470 align:start position:0%
for eligibility from where they are in
the

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
law right now
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
paid out for relief to a homeowner up to
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
a maximum of a thousand dollars
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
because it also has in it a cap on
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
on what can be spent under this program
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
of 25 million dollars so
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's definitely an attempt to stay
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
within bounds but also to provide
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
substantial relief
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's basically it
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't go over section by section when
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
i said that
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
i didn't before when we spoke
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
briefly about this in the previous
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
meeting of this subcommittee but
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
we can certainly do that if you want to
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
what are how are you get how are you
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
arriving at this figure of the homestead
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
value of 150 000. why that figure it was
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
a raise from the existing level i i
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
don't have in my head what the existing
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
level is but it's much lower
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
it was sort of taking
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
look at looking around and how did how
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
did the previous level relate to prices
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
and how does this level relate to prices
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
at this time i don't recall exactly to
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
tell you the truth there's a substantial
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
increase above the well
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
maybe explain to me who sets that uh
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
that rate uh is it uh
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
which department sets that or is
 
00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:43.670 align:start position:0%
which department sets that or is
legislature

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's in statute but how do i know that
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
mine that my homestead's valued at 140
 
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
mine that my homestead's valued at 140
000.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
your assessed value so we're looking at
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
assessed property value right right
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
over at
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
the school funding fairness project
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
and also in municipal and county
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
government we had had a bill
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
that ended up getting stuck on the table
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
because of covet that addressed the fact
 
00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:24.710 align:start position:0%
because of covet that addressed the fact
that

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.069 align:start position:0%
that
originally

00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
originally
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
tax statewide property tax abatement was
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
set put in place there were a large
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
number of people who were able to take
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of it but over the course of
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
time because property values had
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
increased but the level was so low
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
but in the program the number of people
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
who were eligible to climb because of
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
the value of their property declined and
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
it was it was
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
we had actually recommended passing a
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill that raised
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
that level um
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
because it was just out of whack it had
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
been in there for 10 years and it was
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know you weren't you were only
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
eligible if your house was worth 60 000
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
or something and that had been
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know very very few so um
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
that was a bill that we we did pass i
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
think this year that already did go
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
through so
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's set on assessed value and um
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
and this was a reasonable assessment
 
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.069 align:start position:0%
and this was a reasonable assessment
given

00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
given the
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
increase in property values that we've
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
seen in the state in the last year or
 
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.230 align:start position:0%
seen in the state in the last year or
two

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
that's where it came from
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
does that make sense am i well i i i
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
i understand the concept behind all this
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to see
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
achievement levels of students that are
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
coming out of these homes or 150 000 or
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
less if there's any relationship
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that was part of the
 
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.190 align:start position:0%
i don't think that was part of the
um

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.470 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
calculations representative ames can
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong we weren't we're
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
not looking at
 
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.230 align:start position:0%
not looking at
um

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
the achievement of the students we were
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
looking at how
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
getting some property leaf property
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
relief for low-income families property
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
tax relief for low-income families
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
that was the goal of that bill
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that that's the goal of of raising
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
these caps
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
these these homers might homeowners
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
might not have any children you know
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
they might have got that
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's just to help because the property
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
tax is going up and up and up um
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
especially in low
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
property value towns the taxes going up
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
this was a way to help
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
stories that we hear always of the
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
the elderly people living on a fixed
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
income or the low-income families that
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
are struggling to pay their taxes and
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
are attacked property taxed out of their
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
homes because they can't afford it
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
anymore that was what the goal of this
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
was to help those people get some
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
property tax relief
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
i you know and and in addition i think
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
it's also an important distinction
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
because representative porter mentioned
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
programs that invo that evolve
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
abatements this is not an abatement
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
program uh in fact the the school
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
district and the municipality still
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
collect all of the property taxes that
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
they would collect even without this
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
program this is a refund that
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
that goes directly to the homeowners
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
so it does not take money out of the out
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the either the local property tax
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
revenue collected and doesn't place any
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
additional burden on
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
on on other
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers that that do not um
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i i use the wrong term i'm sorry
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
representative i did misspeak with that
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
statement refund
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
in in developing 1680 there was a
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
recognition that
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
the burden the tax burden in some
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
communities was much too high
 
00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:05.910 align:start position:0%
communities was much too high
and

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
that needed to be
 
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.790 align:start position:0%
that needed to be
be

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.270 align:start position:0%
be
fixed

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
but it all there was also recognition
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
that the tax burden for some homeowners
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
even with very low rates in those
 
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
even with very low rates in those
communities

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
was still too high and
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
that for those homeowners there needed
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
to be relief so this is
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
responding to the reality that after
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
done if 1680 is done there will still be
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
significant dependence on the property
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
tax wherever you live whether it's
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
bedford or portsmouth or
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh claremont and uh
 
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
uh claremont and uh
and

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's where you live and if your
 
00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.270 align:start position:0%
that's where you live and if your
circumstances

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
are not up to the level that enables you
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
to stay in your home by paying whatever
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
the property tax may be then this bill
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
is intended to provide help to you
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
in those situations so it's a part and
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
parcel of a larger picture
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
and inevitable we think
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh continuing dependence on the property
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
tax but even more even
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
in a more even way
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
and providing relief to individual
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
even once all of that happens still need
 
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.309 align:start position:0%
even once all of that happens still need
help

00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
let's keep moving here unless can i just
 
00:50:32.319 --> 00:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
let's keep moving here unless can i just
um

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
in deference to representative ames's
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
work um
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if i did not mention
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are in fact folks in
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
bedford who have been there for
 
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.950 align:start position:0%
bedford who have been there for
generations

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
generations
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
they're farmers whose land
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
far exceeds property values that have
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
typically allowed for any kind of
 
00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:56.470 align:start position:0%
typically allowed for any kind of
abatement

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
abatement
 
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.670 align:start position:0%
abatement
however

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
their income
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
has them cash strapped and sometimes
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
losing their homes because they can't
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
afford to pay
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the taxes
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh and so i'm hopeful that
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
we keep that in mind when we're when
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
we're tossing around uh
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
names of communities because right
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
within my very own community i have
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh as one would call them the haves and
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
the have-nots so
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
i'd like to pick up on that actually uh
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
and point out that in this bill there's
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
another section that sets up a study
 
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.670 align:start position:0%
another section that sets up a study
committee

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
on the property tax relief program
 
00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:42.150 align:start position:0%
on the property tax relief program
to

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
other categories that may not be reached
 
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.510 align:start position:0%
other categories that may not be reached
renters

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
renters
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
what about renters you know
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
this provides no help to renters this is
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
a homeowner tax relief program
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
and what about farmers maybe there is a
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
special aspect to
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
farming and farms that
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
that can be targeted in a
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
through a statewide relief program and
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
that's not sort of dependent on opting
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
in at the municipal level that's
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately addressed statewide so
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's why that study committee is in
 
00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
that's why that study committee is in
there

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.309 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
this

00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is targeting homeowners
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
but we know that renters
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
are affected by property tax it's
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
indirect but we know that's true let's
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
look at that and see if there's some way
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
we can deal with that too
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i i concur with you represent
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
mullen what you just said
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
all across northern new england you had
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
people turn their property into tree
 
00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.870 align:start position:0%
people turn their property into tree
farms

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
farms
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
especially in maine along the coast
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
where they couldn't afford to stay on
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the coast yet their incomes didn't match
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
current use which we have here in the
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
state uh for those properties which are
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
larger than that 10 acre
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
that was my concern to begin with the
 
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
that was my concern to begin with the
its

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
income as well is is the driving force
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
you go up to lincoln
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
and franconia area
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
and properties are valued very high
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
but incomes are not
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
at the same level as the valuation the
 
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.990 align:start position:0%
at the same level as the valuation the
property

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:20.230 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
and

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
we've put a lot of emphasis in recently
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
in reducing the uh
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
business tax rates
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
in in the states so that there's some
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
relief for businesses paying their taxes
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
but we've done
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt i think to give some
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
property tax relief to people who who
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
need it um as well so
 
00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.630 align:start position:0%
need it um as well so
just

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
so just throw that in for a little can
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
we move beyond now this area right
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
let's go and get beyond the statewide
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
education property tax i'm sure that
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of concern
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
from some communities on that
 
00:54:00.559 --> 00:54:01.750 align:start position:0%
from some communities on that
uh

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have to rehash that right here
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
now no i i don't think so and i think
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
we've gone through most of the bill now
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
um and um and and we do have um mark
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
from uh from the department
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
maybe it's good to good to pivot over to
 
00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:17.109 align:start position:0%
maybe it's good to good to pivot over to
yes

00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
after that we can start looking at
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
oh and i and i think it's also worth
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
just highlighting and and um
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative ames talked about it how
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
um how ways and means has retained
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
essentially this tax portion of the of
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
the bill and the property tax relief
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
um for not retained it's been it's been
 
00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:43.910 align:start position:0%
um for not retained it's been it's been
uh

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
interim studied so so they have that and
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
and in committee and we'll be uh interim
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
studying that so um so i think that's
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something that i think
 
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.750 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something that i think
helps

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
helps
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
as well thank you
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
we should have these spreadsheets on a
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
little wider paper
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think i should just grab one dick oh
 
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:58.789 align:start position:0%
i think i should just grab one dick oh
sorry

00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
sorry i was wrestling without mark
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
manganello administrator of school
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
finance with the department of education
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the uh the font is
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
the font is i think 12 or 13 but um i
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
was wrestling with a printer and i in
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
the printer one so that
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
this is what we have
 
00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:18.470 align:start position:0%
this is what we have
uh

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
so before what i handed out was a fiscal
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
year 24
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
adequacy spreadsheet um there's a lot
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
going on in this formula so it's
 
00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:26.789 align:start position:0%
going on in this formula so it's
actually

00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
the first page is working as looking at
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
just the weights and then the second
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
page starts dealing with the grant
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
amounts um there's usually it's now
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
getting harder and harder to put an
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy spreadsheet on
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
on one page so i thought i could split
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
it up and that might help with the small
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
font but
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
it's still pretty difficult to read so i
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
up at the top i just want to say that
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
this is a preliminary analysis
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
typically the process whenever the
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
department's looking at an adequacy
 
00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:54.950 align:start position:0%
department's looking at an adequacy
change

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
the department can certainly do an
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
analysis by itself but we prefer to have
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
the lba involved
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
it adds for a better quality control
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
process so this is my
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is my first crack at trying to see
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact of 24. as uh
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
for hp 1680 as introduced
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
just like when policymakers are dealing
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
with adequacy formula changes it's trial
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
and error sometimes it's also trial and
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
error for the department as far as
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
making these calculations and being
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
introduced to a new formula
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
so that's what this this spreadsheet is
 
00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:28.950 align:start position:0%
so that's what this this spreadsheet is
um

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i'll start i'll start by
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
with the first page it's the weights and
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
i think um uh mr artinger walked through
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
that uh last week
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
um these weights are
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
eventual essentially what you're doing
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
is you're calculating you're adding up
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
the weights and eventually you will
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
times the weights by 6 500.
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
so 180m so each school has one adm
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
or each school that educates is
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for educating a student has
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
an adm
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to count as one weight so
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
one student count essentially costs
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
counts towards uh
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
6 500 dollars in the in the
 
00:58:05.119 --> 00:58:06.789 align:start position:0%
6 500 dollars in the in the
formula

00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
then we move on to fnr fnr is 1.49 so i
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
think that turns out to be around 9 000
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh per fnr student because the weight is
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
1.449 for each fnr student
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know you know while we're looking at
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
base adm and fnr adm one of the
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
challenges we're currently dealing with
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
as we as education knows is the fnr
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
numbers are
 
00:58:30.079 --> 00:58:31.109 align:start position:0%
numbers are
uh

00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
a challenge right now so that 34 000
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
number that's probably low um
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's probably more than 35 or 34 000
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
students out there
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for fnr but as you all
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
know about the usda wish issue and the
 
00:58:46.079 --> 00:58:47.589 align:start position:0%
know about the usda wish issue and the
waivers

00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
both house and senate are trying to
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
figure out how to deal with fnr data
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
currently we have a hold harmless for 22
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
23 we have a modification
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
to the fnr data using a governor
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's formula that he
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
introduced in hp2
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's based on ratios um but 20 fiscal
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
year 24 has no modification in law to
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
address fnr data so i just put in the
 
00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:10.870 align:start position:0%
address fnr data so i just put in the
the

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
currently collected number which is
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know low it's not modified it's 34
 
00:59:15.839 --> 00:59:16.870 align:start position:0%
you know low it's not modified it's 34
000.

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
um so just give away roll on i think we
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
ought to be asked questions as you go
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
through sure so the ratio would be let's
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
say in
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
fy 19
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
to the regulation here's the percentage
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
and now taking that same type of ratio
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
and applying to whatever our enrollment
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
is right now that would be the number of
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
f and r we would have yep that's the
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
modification in 23 correct it's a ratio
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
base so you're looking at um actually
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh school year 1920 seeing what your f
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
and ratio relative how many f r students
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
do you have relative to the total
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
students um if it was 50
 
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:56.870 align:start position:0%
students um if it was 50
um

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
then you look at the current data where
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
you might have an enrollment drop but
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
you might have a really significant f r
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
drop and um we apply that 50 ratio so if
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at current data and say
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
you have 100 kids we would apply that 50
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
ratio to bring your fnr numbers to 50.
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
um but the actual data might say the fnr
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
numbers are 10. so we're going to bring
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
you up to 50. so that modifies the fnr
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
data to match historical ratios of fnr
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
to total students
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
that's the 23
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
modification that's occurring does that
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
parallel the application to the federal
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
government for various grants what we're
 
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
government for various grants what we're
doing

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of using a ratio to identify
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
our fnr has that been approved by the
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
feds um
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that um
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
the fnr of course it's um the feds um as
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
an idea the feds um i don't know where
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're at as far as
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
allowing flexibility in our fnr numbers
 
01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:54.710 align:start position:0%
allowing flexibility in our fnr numbers
um

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
we could yeah it's possible but yeah um
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
i have no information on that as far as
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
if we're using that for our federal
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
grants i know carl perkins is based on
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
fnr too
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes a lot of grants use fnr data yes
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes right thanks thanks rick and thanks
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
mark for um for this and this side
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
discussion i think is really important
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
on the free and reduced price lunch data
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
it obviously affects much more than new
 
01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
it obviously affects much more than new
hampshire

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
and affects every other state and it
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
affects um federal uh programs uh as
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
well so um so
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
and and mark you've been involved in our
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
ad hoc
 
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.109 align:start position:0%
ad hoc
um

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
um committee to to study this
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
have um have has the has the usdoe
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
provided any further guidance on on use
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price launch data than
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
what we've talked about so far
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
so the only
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
most states
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is unique in a sense
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for federal funding new
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire allocates based on fnr data
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're kind of the exception not the rule
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
most states use census data but new
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire has because we have very small
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
we don't historically like the census
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
data has margin of error we haven't
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
relied on it it can produce really odd
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
results when you have
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
census data determining poverty
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
so we've always used fnr data but we're
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
kind of the exception so at usd um
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
usn might not have a global policy to
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
deal with it because new hampshire is a
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
little unique
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
um what we have
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh talking with uh our
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition program
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility for us to use
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid data as a direct cert
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
so currently we use snap tanf
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
foster data to certify who is fnr data
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't need an application for that
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
we can just go to dhs's database and get
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
information about the income of that
 
01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
information about the income of that
family

01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
so we're currently exploring the
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
possibility of having using medicaid
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
data to direct cert our fnr data and so
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
that might put less pressure on
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
communities to get those applications if
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
we have a bigger pool of data to direct
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
cert from but
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little it's a pilot program so
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
you usa doesn't just allow anyone and it
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
involves the center for medicaid
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
services allowing that data their data
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
um to be used for that so um it's going
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
to be a process where we've started
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
looking into it
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
and seeing what we need to do to far as
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
far as to get into that system and be
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to use medicaid to direct cert
 
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.589 align:start position:0%
allowed to use medicaid to direct cert
um

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
but at the moment that's um we're just
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
exploring that thank you very much yeah
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
we won't pursue that we know that karen
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
nunberger's committee is looking at that
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
right now and there are some states that
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
have been approved to use that
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
information but uh we're going to have
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
to hold on that
 
01:03:50.079 --> 01:03:52.069 align:start position:0%
to hold on that
yeah

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:52.950 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's the fnr data and
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
a lot going on with student data of
 
01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
a lot going on with student data of
course

01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
this is this this this bill is looking
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
10 years in to the future
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's a 10-year phase-in
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
and you know student data
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
obviously pandemic impacted as well
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
hard to know how to predict that as well
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
fnr data has had some variability
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic as well
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
but just moving on
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
sped data there uh 29 762 times the 4.29
 
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.870 align:start position:0%
sped data there uh 29 762 times the 4.29
weight

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
weight
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
that gets you the the sped weight
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
english language learner
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
4 600 students there times it by the
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
2.20 weight
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
you get that weight
 
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
you get that weight
the

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
kind of tricky one and this took a lot
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of playing around with and trying
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
to get this right is this new metric
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
these those metrics are we're pretty
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
used to dealing with but this new metric
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
is based on
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
over here the big column that says
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
weights it's based on the number of adm
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
in your school district uh you follow a
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
very specific formula to get a very
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
specific weight
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
and so reading this bill
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
i um
 
01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:02.789 align:start position:0%
i um
i

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:03.910 align:start position:0%
i
assumed

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
assumed
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
i know it says adma but we're making the
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
assumption admr
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
universally at the moment
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
um because we paid adequacy of admr and
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
eventually this committee hopefully
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
we'll see senate bill 386 which is going
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.839 --> 01:05:22.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the adm of the school
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
district not the adm of the town to
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
calculate this weight so for example
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
acworth is part of fall mountain acworth
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
only has 79 admrs in the town but the
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
school district of fall mountain has
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
north of
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
1200 students
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the school district
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
that athwork is a part of
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at do what bucket do
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
they fall into they fall in the one to
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
200 they fall into 201 to 600 do they
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
fall etc do they fall in the bucket as
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
described in law
 
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.710 align:start position:0%
described in law
um

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm first determining what bucket they
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
fall in
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
and then i'm adding in that negative uh
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very small small small fraction
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm even smaller with a print on the
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
page uh very very small fraction so for
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
fall mountain it's it's um negative zero
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
zero zero four nine times 80 m and for
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
this calculation i'm timing it by the
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
adm of the school district
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
um so i'm timing not by 79 but by
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
something north of 1200 which is fall
 
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
something north of 1200 which is fall
mountain

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
and then we're adding at the very end
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're adding and basically when you
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
times a negative number times a positive
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
number like the adm of a school district
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're producing a negative number but
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
then we add uh at the very end we add
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
something to it so we're adding 1.008
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
for that particular school district and
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
it brings the number positive and so
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
then you take that positive number and
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
then you would times it by the admr of
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality to get the weight for
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
that municipality so it's it's a little
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
technical there's a lot going on there
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
but that's a new calculation and i
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
believe i did my math right
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
one of the other kind of uh
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
challenges with this is some towns are
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
part of multiple school districts so
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
when i was trying to calculate that
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
essentially i looked at
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to mix amherst is not a
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
good example but i'm going to go down to
 
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.950 align:start position:0%
good example but i'm going to go down to
ashland

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
ashland
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
ashland is part of two school districts
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
their high schoolers are part of the
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
pemi baker district and then below that
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
they're part of the ashland school
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
district so i apportioned out the
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
weights based on how many students
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
attend uh within the town of ashland are
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the particular
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
district so
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
some of their students fall in that
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
under 200 bucket and some of those
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
students fall in this 201 to 600 bucket
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
and basically i apportioned out the
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
weight based on the percentage of
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
students that fall within each
 
01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.710 align:start position:0%
students that fall within each
uh

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
that attend each district
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a little complicated um but
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the methodology i use for
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
this um i believe it's it's how we would
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
do if this bill were to pass
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that's how the department
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
would approach it but um
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
might need to study it further to make
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure it's accurate and it does what it
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
needs to do um so that's kind of a
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
technical aspect um any questions about
 
01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:06.470 align:start position:0%
technical aspect um any questions about
that

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
i know it's kind of a new concept
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
th this whole concept in this
 
01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.589 align:start position:0%
th this whole concept in this
uh

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh handing out somebody based on the
 
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.070 align:start position:0%
uh handing out somebody based on the
population

01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.590 align:start position:0%
population
is

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.870 align:start position:0%
is
are

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
some some
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
dis states break it even further
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
dis states break it even further
by

01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
elementary middle
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
high school population
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
and some break it up by geographic
 
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
and some break it up by geographic
location

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
um i understand where we're going uh
 
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
um i understand where we're going uh
it's

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
it is
somewhat

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
somewhat
complicated

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh for these districts which have
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
we may have to revisit it a little bit
 
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
we may have to revisit it a little bit
but

01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
so so rick and mark
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
excellent work on this
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
um i think what um you know when mark's
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the the complexity it's
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
not so much with um
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
with with you know free and reduced
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
price lunch or special education or ell
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
those are you know
 
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.950 align:start position:0%
those are you know
um

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
we call them weights but essentially
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
that's the same as as the differentiated
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
cost factors that we have in the current
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
um you know in the current formula where
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
special education has a differentiated
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
cost factor of 0.5
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
pretty close to 0.5 you know multiplied
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
against the base cost of an adequate
 
01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:36.309 align:start position:0%
against the base cost of an adequate
education

01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
where it gets where it gets tricky in
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
here is in the school size so this is
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
this is determining
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
a um
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's a formula
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
driven by student characteristics and
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
district characteristics so fall
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
mountain a great a great example so you
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
might have a small municipality sending
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
to fall mountain but it's the district
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics as you've applied uh
 
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.709 align:start position:0%
characteristics as you've applied uh
here

01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:01.910 align:start position:0%
here
and

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
and uh those those district
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
characteristics as they relate to total
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
district enrollment or or adm
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
have yes a complicated formula because
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to have enrollment cliffs
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
where if you took on one more student
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
then you would lose
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of money so or or in
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
to tremendous amount of grant
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
potentially so
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
this this formula takes on you know the
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
formula of you know y equals mx plus b
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
where you've got the the slope and the
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
y-intercept and that's the negative part
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
which always becomes positive when you
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
add the the intercept
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
into it and gives you a smooth
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
transition as the size of your school
 
01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
transition as the size of your school
grows

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
grows
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
and um and and you and you you know can
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
increase efficiencies with uh with
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
larger in larger districts
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
um so so you know we think it it really
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
does does approximate
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
what uh what uh what our total statewide
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
budget uh comes to in fact in the in the
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
final column here mark you uh you get
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much right on
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
what the um what the total um state
 
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
what the um what the total um state
spend

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
combination of local revenues and state
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
revenues spent on um on you know uh
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
publix by public school districts across
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
the state in the uh the year where where
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
this calculation was was based which i
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
think was
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
was uh fy 19 so
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and i'm sorry f1
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
yeah fy 19. yeah
 
01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
yeah fy 19. yeah
and

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
just to talk about it this is a new
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
concept that i just went through pretty
 
01:11:52.719 --> 01:11:54.709 align:start position:0%
concept that i just went through pretty
quickly

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'll say that um
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
i had multiple columns this is a roll-up
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
obviously i had multiple columns of work
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
of dividing out the districts dividing
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
out the buckets so i could present it
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
that way which would
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
it just would be a
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
lot more columns on the spreadsheet um
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
but yeah it is a new it is a new concept
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of uh a lot of excel
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
columns that went into it and this is
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
just a roll up of where it ended up um
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
but yeah it's and thanks for that uh the
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
sort of explaining of the algebra with
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
that that's that's helpful to understand
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
so uh and then uh to
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
moving forward that's the weights for
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
the school district size
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
as as uh we don't have uh this formula
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically call out geography
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
but you maybe you could
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
school district sizes sometimes a proxy
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
for geography not exactly um
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
well in other states geography is very
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
very important
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
i was in one state where hydrofoil
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
served as a school bus
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
and you had to have a pilot's license
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
run the hydrofoil but i i think in terms
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
of looking at weights in schools it
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
costs more
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
i feel and some people debate me to
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
educate a high school student than it
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
does a
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
elementary student due to the technology
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
required in that high school
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
credits to graduate
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
and we that's how we came about with the
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
universal class initially in the old
 
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.550 align:start position:0%
universal class initially in the old
formula

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
formula
but

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.430 align:start position:0%
but
there

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
i i can explain how a pinkerton works
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
where all these sending districts are
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
going to pinkerton
 
01:13:38.159 --> 01:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
going to pinkerton
and

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe that's
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a discussion for another
 
01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.830 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a discussion for another
day

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
day
because

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's an ongoing discussion which we
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
have um
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
don't go there right now please just
 
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
keep marching along with your formula
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
yep uh
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
the grades are the next part of the
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
equation as representative vlad chairman
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
lad was pointing out grades is also part
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the formula here um grades six to
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
eight uh 38k in the states add that 1.42
 
01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.870 align:start position:0%
eight uh 38k in the states add that 1.42
weights

01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
weights
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah one or multiply by that 1.428 you
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
get a weight there
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
nine through 12 12th grades um 59 51k in
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
the state multiply by 0.42 weight you
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
add that to weight total and then we're
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to get to the end we're going to
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
sum up all the weights we just produced
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
we went through
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
the methodology here to get all these
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
weights we have 450 000
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
units of weights if you want i guess you
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
want to call them that
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
now we're going to times that by that
 
01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.430 align:start position:0%
now we're going to times that by that
6501

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
6501
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that gets us that 2.9 billion dollar
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
number which represents luna was talking
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
about uh we typically spend um north of
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
3 billion a year when you look at all of
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
our k-12 district
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
funding expenditures um it's uh so it
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
gets close to that that three billion
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
dollar number
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
and so this is the weights i'm going to
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
move on to the next
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
one last question mark so if i change
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
the weight in special ed from a 4.29
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
to a 3.29
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to increase somewhere
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
else i'll wait somewhere else to come up
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the amount of money we need at the
 
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.510 align:start position:0%
with the amount of money we need at the
end

01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
if that's what your objective was
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're looking to hit that
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
target that three billion dollar target
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
then then yeah you would have to play
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
around with it as far as take from here
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
add to here
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
so i i'd like to ask representative ames
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
and represent luna is that 303 billion
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
target what we're aiming for based upon
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing out of the doe 25. so
 
01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:45.910 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing out of the doe 25. so
so

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
short short answer is yes and um and
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
what that what that 3 billion you know
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
2.957 or whatever it it it comes to
 
01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
2.957 or whatever it it it comes to
um

01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
and so this is the total spend less
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
federal less federal dollars um
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
that that total statewide um
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
school district budget gives you yields
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
a total statewide student outcome
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
so so that statewide budget
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
approximately three billion dollars gets
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
you a statewide outcome which the
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
average is is
 
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:24.870 align:start position:0%
average is is
is

01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
strong nationally it's strong regionally
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and it means you know the average
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
student's 50th percentile is the is the
 
01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
student's 50th percentile is the is the
average

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
average
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so what um
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
what uh what what this what this bill
 
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
what uh what what this what this bill
does

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
is is carves up that that three billion
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
dollars into district budgets what would
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
it take the the hillsborough deering
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
school district to educate its average
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
student to a statewide outcome what
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
about manchester what about hopkinton
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
what about bedford what about haverhill
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
what about wolfeboro and and um and and
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
it does that for every every district in
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
and um and it used
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
well it did that and then it determined
 
01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
well it did that and then it determined
weights

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
weights
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
that would allow you through a more
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward algebraic you know
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
formula that we could put in statute to
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
to essentially come to the same numbers
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
as what the statistical analysis did
 
01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
as what the statistical analysis did
so

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you if you then
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
change the special education weight
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
bring it bring it from
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
let's say 4.29 to 3.29
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
and increase the
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch weight from
 
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.510 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced lunch weight from
1.49

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
1.49
 
01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.790 align:start position:0%
1.49
to

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
to i'm making it up you know 3.75
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah you might get to the same
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
three billion dollar number but now
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
you're no longer approximating the um
 
01:17:58.159 --> 01:17:58.870 align:start position:0%
you're no longer approximating the um
the

01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
budgets that would be required for
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
hillsborough deering to get to a
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
statewide outcome and for manchester and
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
bedford and haverhill and every other
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
district to get to a
 
01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
statewide outcome you're now departing
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
from that that from that
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh model
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
um you know based on what districts are
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
spending and what outcomes they're
 
01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.709 align:start position:0%
spending and what outcomes they're
getting

01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
so you can do it you can get to the same
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
total spend but you know your but you've
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
you've now left
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh you've now departed from the idea
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that we really want to close
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps between
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
hillsborough deering manchester bedford
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro and all the other districts in
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
see you know the one area that when we
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
had the commission that i was concerned
 
01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
had the commission that i was concerned
about

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
is that we have a targeted amount of
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
money to get the kids to the performance
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
level that we want
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
in order to achieve that we have these
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
weights strung across all these levels
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
but i i believe that even in the special
 
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
ed domain here
 
01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.669 align:start position:0%
ed domain here
that

01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
to fund
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
a child that's getting very little iep
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
support but has an iep
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
another a 26 000
 
01:19:18.239 --> 01:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
another a 26 000
amount

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
is high
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
um and i don't want to see districts
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
starting to say i know how to get more
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
money in my budget i'm just going to
 
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
give more ieps out and believe me i've
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
seen this happen in schools
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
and sometimes kids are identified too
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
early they're over identified etc
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that's not good for the child
 
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.830 align:start position:0%
and that's not good for the child
either

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:42.630 align:start position:0%
either
so

01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
so if the average cost is twenty six
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for all our
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
are our children that have ieps which
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know roughly i'm taking the four
 
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
you know roughly i'm taking the four
point

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
two and multiplying by the yeah getting
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
roughly 26 grand
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
in my head so
 
01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.350 align:start position:0%
in my head so
if

01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's the amount of money we need to
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
run our programs then
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
targeting money towards a
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
outcome that's a performance outcome not
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily targeting towards the
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
providing the service for that child
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm really communicating
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
clearly what i'm trying to address here
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
but many states have
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
weighted amounts based upon iep
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
and based upon the cost to deliver that
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
particular iep we know we have some kids
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
are very very expensive children in
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
terms of their iep and others
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
years ago we just had in monitoring and
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't get any service now they
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
have some support and maybe 15 minutes a
 
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.870 align:start position:0%
have some support and maybe 15 minutes a
week

01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
does that cost 26 000
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
i see there's room for abuse on this
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
this weight weighted formula so so a
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
couple things on that rick and and i
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
think your points well taken um on it
 
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.629 align:start position:0%
think your points well taken um on it
that

01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
but but also there's a there's a
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
self-correcting element to to um to this
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill as well where where the formula is
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
redeveloped every
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
analyzed no no less frequently than
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and i would advocate
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
every five years based on on current
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
spending and what the um what what the
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
outcomes um uh
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
these districts are
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
are are delivering for their for their
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
students so so
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps what what what could be done to
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
also help address this
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
sort of in a in a nip it in the bud um
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint is to include that in the
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
accountability uh standpoint you know
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
provisions to uh to help prevent or
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
any any sort of um you know inflation
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
of either of of any of these student
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics whether it's
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch special
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
education ell
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
to prevent any abuse on um uh you know
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
on on that but
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
but you know fact of the matter is the
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
same is true today
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
where um where we have the
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid factors and you could
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
clearly i suppose a district could
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
inflate the number of of you know
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
english language learners or or students
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
in special education to um
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know to to get additional money and
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
there's currently no feedback mechanism
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
in the um in the system but there is a
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
significant difference between seventeen
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and twenty six thousand
 
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and twenty six thousand
dollars

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.430 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
certainly a significant difference but
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
but again what this is what this is
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
about doing is is identifying the
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
budgets for every district that that are
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
required for um for state outcomes
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
statewide outcomes and um and districts
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
are still responsible to um to to get as
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
far into that um that that meeting that
 
01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:01.830 align:start position:0%
far into that um that that meeting that
cost

01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh through the um through the local
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
minimum contribution and and where the
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
state comes in is is if that's not
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
sufficient to get there so that
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
hillsborough deering wouldn't need to
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
work any harder than newport wouldn't
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
need to work any harder than hopkinton
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to work any harder than
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro in order to um to to get to
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
their uh their foundation opportunity
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
budget and the the state grant comes in
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
to um to make up the difference see i
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'd only propose that
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
as we did here in that center column
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the weights for your the
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
number of students you have within your
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
district there's various categories
 
01:23:40.239 --> 01:23:41.189 align:start position:0%
district there's various categories
there

01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
to then have a similar breakdown
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
in special ed
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
where you could do it by weights of need
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
doing your formula here your whole
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
concept it could be done
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's just a lot more work to do that and
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see some other you know
 
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see some other you know
options

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
discussed at least
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
as you've brought up rick and i and i
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
think it's it's it's something that the
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
commission uh also recommended and and
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was not able to um
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
to review is is those different
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
categories that that may have different
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
cost factors to them and i think that's
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's we had that discussion yes that's
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
very relevant to to do i know that's
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
something that the research team was
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
very interested in getting but we i
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
think we only had the data for one year
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason and
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
so so as that data becomes available i
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
think that's something to look at
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
something also i think important to
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
point out in um in the um
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the it's in the bill and and
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
certainly in um it's in the bill through
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budgets were
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
calculated that it does not include
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
categorical grants like special
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
education aid um
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know as being one of those so so for
 
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.669 align:start position:0%
you know as being one of those so so for
for

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh students who fall into for special
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
education students that that fall into
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
categories that you were talking about
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's outside of
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
this budget because it's contained
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
within categorical
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
i may be jumping ahead of you mark but i
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to just
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
ask you i'm looking across the um rows
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
here i'm looking at antrim one of my
 
01:25:38.239 --> 01:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
here i'm looking at antrim one of my
towns

01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
and the final figure
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the far right
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
is six million four hundred ninety
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
is that the figure according to all
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
these numbers that it costs
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you're no i'm sorry
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
my little my little uh
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
eyes are
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay but the same figures okay that's
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
what you according to all these figures
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's how much
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
it would cost to educate
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
to provide adequate education for the
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
kids in antrim given all these weights
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
and numbers
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
so i i as far as the policy aspect i
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
would refer to members on the commission
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
um it's the it's it's antrim's part of
 
01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh reaching that um
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
statewide average outcome is that
 
01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.110 align:start position:0%
statewide average outcome is that
correct

01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then from that
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
we figure out how much the state's going
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
to contribute and the town's going to
 
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.030 align:start position:0%
to contribute and the town's going to
contribute

01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
right so that okay so that's what that
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
figure is yeah so the so so the way that
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
would work and let's just
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
because i was just looking down the
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
thing and there's some huge numbers in
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
there like concord's got 68 million
 
01:26:54.239 --> 01:26:55.270 align:start position:0%
there like concord's got 68 million
um

01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of different
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
differences and i know that's because of
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
the number of students but
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to know what that figure
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
was and i think you answered yeah so i
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
think mark's probably going to walk us
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's on the second um
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
part of the handout
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
we'll walk us through how you get to
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
that okay i have one last comment on
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
this front page
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
weight for fnr and we know that poverty
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
is a significant factor
 
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
is a significant factor
that

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
contributes to
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
our metrics which get back an
 
01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
our metrics which get back an
achievement

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
and then i look at the the sped column
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
and we have 34 000 youngsters in one and
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
29 or close to
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
30 in another
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
and yet the weights are so different
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
would we get more mileage if we were to
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
take some of that weight and move one
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
other way if in fact
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
we were to get into a breakdown on the
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
different weights for
 
01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.910 align:start position:0%
different weights for
for

01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
special ed ieps different ieps and put
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
the difference over into a weighted
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
we we posed your question to the sped
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
bureau um the one you had last week
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd um as far as the doe 25
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of it cost of special education
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
i actually ran i ran the math real quick
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
about uh 780 million and sped cost uh
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
k-12 district education 780 million
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
divided by 30 000 is approximately that
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
26 000 average that's the only
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
information i have available to me uh
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as the co sped students and
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
cost of sped students uh
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
but yeah as far as getting granular i i
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't have that information yeah and and
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
using averages like that is not always
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
the best way to
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's certainly some outliers yeah
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to see that plotted out on
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's let's move on to the second
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
sheet then okay
 
01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
sheet then okay
so

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
the second sheet is um
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
where uh we that 2.9 billion number um
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
rolled that over into the second sheet
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
so that's how we ended calculating all
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
those weights we got to that 2.9 billion
 
01:29:05.830 --> 01:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
dollar number
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
um so that's the first that's column c
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
in column d is the adjusted annual
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget so
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
this is going to be adjusted over i
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
think in the bill is introduced adjusted
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
over i think eight years
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
or you know several years and so the
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment first off um no matter what
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
the adjustment will always be 95 95
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
off that 2.9 billion dollar uh so 5 off
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
that 2.9 billion dollar number that's
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
the first adjustment that is made to
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
calculate the annual foundation or just
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
an annual foundation opportunity budget
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
but then there's another adjustment and
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
this judge judgment is going to
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
progressively get
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
higher so the amount decreased will be
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
progressively lower uh over time
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
in that first year in 24 under the bills
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
introduced it's 70 percent and then i
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
think the next year it's going to be 74
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
so over time over the the phase-in
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
period the adjusted annual foundation
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is going to grow each
 
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.590 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget is going to grow each
year

01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
that percentage
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
cut from it is going to decrease each
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
year so eventually holding all these
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
weights constant eventually it would be
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
95 percent of that 2.9 billion right now
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
applying that 95
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment plus the 70 adjustment it's
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
equal to 1.9 billion
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
so that's how that and basically
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
the way to think about this as far as
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
comparing it to this is kind of the cost
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education so this is the
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
benchmark that the state is determining
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
it is it's uh uh uh schools must achieve
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
this is sort of the benchmark uh similar
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
the way adequacy is cost of inadequate
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
education is so that number is going to
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
progressively get big holding student
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
weights constant which i know is not um
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
the case um holding student weights cost
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
it as we uh increase the
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
percentage applied until we get to 100
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the adjusted annual foundation
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget that's going to get
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
closer to that 2.9 billion number
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
then the next step so that sets the
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
standard the next step is looking at the
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
local side
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
so the next step is a five dollar per
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
thousand with the equalized valuation
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
property statewide um
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
five dollar per thousand tax rate
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
applied to each of these towns um and so
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
i i did it just consistently applied the
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
five dollar per thousand uh there's some
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
possibility to um under the bill i think
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's some possibility to go under
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
five five dollars and then there's a
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
potential financial penalty but um we
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
can get we get out of those weeds later
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
or we can get into those weeds later um
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
so column e there's five dollars per
 
01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
so column e there's five dollars per
thousand

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
thousand
um

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
so if we do five thousand dollars per
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
thousand and we look at every single one
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
of these community that's going to raise
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
1.1 billion dollars uh statewide
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
so we have our standard which is 1.9
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
billion and then we're going to look at
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
the the five dollar tax rate which is
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
the locals can bring in 1.1 to achieve
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
that standard that's their sort of their
 
01:32:06.639 --> 01:32:07.910 align:start position:0%
that standard that's their sort of their
contribution

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
um but we're not done there yet the con
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
the minimum actual minimum local
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
contribution is to look at
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
what is the adjusted annual foundation
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget and what does the
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand and pick the
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two so that's going to be
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
the actual minimum local contribution
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
or expected to hit
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
so the standard is 1.9 billion the
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
minimum local contribution of the local
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is expected to be around a
 
01:32:38.239 --> 01:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is expected to be around a
billion

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
billion
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
we uh do that standard that 1.9 billion
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
minus the one uh 1 billion and we get
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
how much the state com
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
contribution is the state opportunity
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
grant and that's about it's 935 million
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know essentially 2 billion minus a
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
billion equals a billion
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's the state opportunity grant
 
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
that's the state opportunity grant
then

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a transition grant and
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
this might be new and i'm good this get
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
really technical and i i cuz i only
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
found out about this a few years ago but
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
the bill says and and the rep the
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
authors of the bill might want to
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
revisit this because it might not have
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
been uh what they intended
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
but when we say total education grant in
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 198 we do not actually mean all
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
money that gets distributed under rsa
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
198 colon 42. the total education grant
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
as defined in as implied in statute does
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
not actually include stabilization and
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
it would not include that swept hold
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
harmless so this is probably not the
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
intent uh uh if the representative
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
speaks that this is probably not the
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
intent of this this uh
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
calculation but i included that number
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
here so that might be something if that
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
was not the intent it might need to be
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
revisited um uh by the sponsors of the
 
01:33:56.719 --> 01:33:57.750 align:start position:0%
revisited um uh by the sponsors of the
bill

01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.830 align:start position:0%
bill
um

01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
so normally our 23 adequacy is expected
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
to be i think uh
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
954 billion uh when you include
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
stabilization the swept hold harmless
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
but right now i am only showing
 
01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
780 million so that's just
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
a technical thing with the adequacy law
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
using that definition of total education
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
grant i'm going to look at
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
is your total education grant for your
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
particular municipality is it higher
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
under the 23 formula
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
is it is it higher under that than what
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
you would be getting as a state
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity grant if it is
 
01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
opportunity grant if it is
um

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh if it is then you're paid the delta
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
the variance you're essentially hold
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
harmless in this transition grant
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
and for 24 under the bill is introduced
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
the transition grant is going to be 100
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the bill
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
progressively has that grant decline
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
over i believe an eight year period
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
over several years that that transition
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
grant will eventually climb and decline
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
until it's non-existent so it's a
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
phase-out so there's two things going on
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
here if we go back to the beginning the
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
annual foundation opportunity budget is
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
phasing in so that's ramping up
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
this the obligation the state uh the
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
state and local uh institutions must
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to funding their schools
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's going to ramp up over time and
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
the transition grant is going to what
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
holds you harmless is if this formula
 
01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:22.950 align:start position:0%
holds you harmless is if this formula
negative

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
negative
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts you that is going to
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
progressively transition down over time
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the phasing up and the
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
phasing out
 
01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.430 align:start position:0%
phasing out
so

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
the your state funding is going to be
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
that opportunity grant plus a transition
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
grant if you're eligible for a
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
transition grant so the number there is
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars and 48 million
 
01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:45.030 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars and 48 million
um

01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
then the sort of unique thing with this
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
program this this bill
 
01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.629 align:start position:0%
program this this bill
is

01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
now swept is uh 100 not 100 it's 97
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
deposited in the education trust fund
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
and a municipality uh uh gets to keep
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
three thousand sorry three percent
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the swept warrant um
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh for themselves
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
so it's actually swept is not an
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
education grant anymore under this bill
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's a municipal grant
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
but since we're comparing apples to
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
apples here swept is currently an
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
education grant so i'm adding the 3
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
retained swept as basically state aid
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
just to make it apples to apples here
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
even though this swept to the three
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
percent swept or retained will be going
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and not the school
 
01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:33.350 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and not the school
district

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
everyone's getting a three uh everyone
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
that pays everyone every community pays
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
swept every community is getting a three
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
percent retained uh three percent of it
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
retained the rest is going to the
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.070 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
uh

01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
so that is how swept is factored and
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
factored in with this bill
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
and then if we go to the very end here
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
we have hb 1680
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
total state funding total state funding
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
is going to include that opportunity
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
grant that transition grant and you're
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
swept retained
 
01:37:01.199 --> 01:37:02.070 align:start position:0%
swept retained
um

01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
and it equals 1 billion 59 million and
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
then if i look at current law adequacy
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh current law adequacy is estimated to
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
be 100 951 million
 
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:12.950 align:start position:0%
be 100 951 million
so

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
overall we have a net change of 107
 
01:37:15.679 --> 01:37:17.189 align:start position:0%
overall we have a net change of 107
million

01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the town by town
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
some communities are receiving
 
01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.270 align:start position:0%
some communities are receiving
less

01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
less and i think a lot of the reason why
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're sweet receiving less is because
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the way the transition grant is
 
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.470 align:start position:0%
of the way the transition grant is
structured

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
structured
 
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
i've not played with these numbers too
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
much but um
 
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
much but um
uh

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
you're losing if you're losing a swept
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
hold harmless grant or you're losing a
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
stabilization grant factored in as your
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
23 hold harmless that's gonna
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
put a negative number in there
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
also another thing to consider uh for
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
the the sponsors to consider is
 
01:37:53.119 --> 01:37:54.629 align:start position:0%
the the sponsors to consider is
uh

01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless truly isn't a hold
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
harmless uh
 
01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
oh sorry it's not gonna show up as it is
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
a whole harmless but it's not going to
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
show up as a whole harmless on these
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
type of spreadsheets because 24 has the
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
cpi adjustment that 23 doesn't have so
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's also producing some negatives
 
01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.550 align:start position:0%
that's also producing some negatives
here

01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
so that's just things to think about as
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
far as when you look at a spreadsheet
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
what is it telling you um that's that's
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
currently as far as i've got as far as
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
playing with these numbers and looking
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
at what this build does uh
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's the that's uh some of my insights
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
but other than that
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
so in
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
likely more in reality a lot of that i
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
mean right now you're using the same adm
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
as as fy23 is that right um
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh so uh correct
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so so so sorry no um no that's not
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
mostly correct except for there's no fnr
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
modification uh but yes right right
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
so so the what what i would say in p
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
when we see negative numbers they're
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're really um what's the term um
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
artifacts coming from the fnr the the
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
in fy 24 we don't have an f and r
 
01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
in fy 24 we don't have an f and r
modification

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
modification
 
01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.790 align:start position:0%
modification
um

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
they get it right yeah and and then the
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
cpi indexing um
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
well um it's mostly cpi so
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh the 23 there is an fnr modification
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
to help districts out uh 24. i am
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
comparing it to 24 current law i'm using
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
24 current law adm numbers and uh to for
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
to build the hb 1680 analysis um i'm
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
also using it to compare it against
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
current law so that's actually apples to
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
apples the cpi is not the apple store
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's when there's yeah so so so
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
essentially negatives in p are really
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
are really artifacts from from that as
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
opposed because the the hold harmless
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
really is there to bridge most of that
 
01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.910 align:start position:0%
really is there to bridge most of that
um

01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the hold harmless truly is looking
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
at 23 and an attempt and functionally
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
holding you harmless although the
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
definition of total education grant is
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
different than say what you get under
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
our say distributed um
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
um but no uh the the hold harmless is
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
designed uh certainly does what it's
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
intended to do it's supposed to hold uh
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh it works as a whole armless it looks
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
back one year but just when you're doing
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
an analysis and you're comparing current
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
law versus
 
01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.189 align:start position:0%
law versus
projected

01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
projected
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
proposed law
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
it creates those mark i'm looking at the
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
two largest school districts in the
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
state manchester and nashua
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing manchester coming out
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
with an additional 12 million dollars
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm seeing nashville coming out with
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
an additional thirty thousand dollars
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh both have
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
double digit and a thousand students
 
01:40:50.070 --> 01:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
and what would be the right reasoning
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
for one district
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
getting so much more
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the other not
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
i want to say
 
01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.070 align:start position:0%
i want to say
so

01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:02.830 align:start position:0%
i don't know
that's

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'll have to look into that i have no
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer off the top my
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
head i was going to say stabilization
 
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely not stabilization
 
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.709 align:start position:0%
but it's definitely not stabilization
[Music]

01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know i have to look into
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a really good observation as
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
far as the difference there thank you
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i want to get back to
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
the five dollar um
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
where are we looking at that
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
i'm look
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah column e okay so
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'm unders if i'm understanding this
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
right and i could be very wrong
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
we're using a
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
an assessed value in the town
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
of five five dollars per thousand
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
assessed value
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
is that a universal assessed value
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
around the state or just in my
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
particular town so
 
01:41:51.679 --> 01:41:52.870 align:start position:0%
particular town so
a

01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
four-bedroom 2500 square foot house
 
01:41:56.719 --> 01:41:57.750 align:start position:0%
four-bedroom 2500 square foot house
in

01:41:57.750 --> 01:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
nashua would have the same assessed
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
value as a 4 bedroom 25 square foot
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
house in hillsborough or bedford or
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
the amherst no it's based on the the
 
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
property values in your town what i was
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
nodding my head was because it's
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
equalized so your your community might
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
have its own assessment schedule
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
each community does their own assessment
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
some of them are really
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh more frequent some are really
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
assessing every year some are assessing
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
on a delay so it's equalized to match
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
what is the market um
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the market value
 
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.709 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the market value
assessed

01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
assessed
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
in my own town so if my house my 2500
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
square foot house in hillsboro has an
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
assessed hillsborough value of
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars i'm going
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
to pay five
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars times 200
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
for my tax but that's same size house in
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
bedford which might have a 500 000
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
assessed value would be paying five
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars times five hundred
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
years that's correct okay thank you
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
this whole business of valuation of
 
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:04.790 align:start position:0%
this whole business of valuation of
property

01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to my insurance company
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
and find out what the replacement value
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
on my home is it's going to cost the
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
same amount to replace it in the south
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
as the north the value of material and
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
all has gone up
 
01:43:18.870 --> 01:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's out of whack
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
and and just talking long term so this
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
this bill has a a 10-year
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
long-term phase in
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the department has been
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
the department has been
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
kind of we've been comfortable
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
projecting adm out
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
to some extent because we're used to adm
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
we know that data we can see it's pretty
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
consistent um the pandemic has certainly
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
made projecting adm more of a challenge
 
01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.709 align:start position:0%
made projecting adm more of a challenge
because

01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
we're kind of a wait and see we don't
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
know a lot of kids
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
left their district public school um
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
immediately following the pandemic we
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if they're going to come back
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
right now it doesn't seem like it maybe
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
they'll come back later
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
so adm's harder to predict and then i
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
think another thing as far as projecting
 
01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
this out for the full complete phase in
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
and phase out components of it um
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
that five dollars per thousand is
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
property values increase so we have the
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget and then
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
we have that five dollar minimum
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
um if adms are decreasing that's going
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
to go down
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
and if property values are increasing so
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know before you make an adjustment
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
um say every five to ten years you make
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
an adjustment but that's that's what i
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
would predict is the trend line but i
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
definitely don't have any methodology to
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
tell you about the the future of the
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
real estate market i just know that it's
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
very very hot right now so i would
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
expect equalization equalized valuations
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
to rise
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
are we using
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion i know adm
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
a verse adm are
 
01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:52.229 align:start position:0%
a verse adm are
um

01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
this seems to be based premised upon adm
 
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.430 align:start position:0%
this seems to be based premised upon adm
a

01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh so i did the whole the whole
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
calculation is based on admr okay
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
um adma is where student attends the
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
school amr is the resident district um
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
so this is all r this is all r thank you
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
and there was um
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is getting a little
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is getting kind of technical uh
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative luna and representative
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli were going uh having a
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about how to talk about
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
those weights for the school district
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
um so i think representative luna
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
expressed uh
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
he would like the school district to be
 
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:28.830 align:start position:0%
he would like the school district to be
based

01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
based
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the adma of the student
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
where the student attends the adma of
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
that district um
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
i can totally see the logic in that but
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to be
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
difficult you have to be workarounds so
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
we'd have to
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
every student
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
every student essentially belongs to us
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
every student attends a school district
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
essentially belongs to a school district
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they have a name that school
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
district has an adma but for students
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
that we send out of state we would not
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
have the adma of that particular
 
01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.070 align:start position:0%
have the adma of that particular
district

01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
and for students that go to non-public
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
schools we can't really calculate the
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
adma of that so it's just all admr to be
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
universal and i think it probably
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
achieves the intent um but that's just
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
from a data perspective we have to use
 
01:46:17.679 --> 01:46:20.149 align:start position:0%
from a data perspective we have to use
admr

01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
admr
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
um rick yeah mark also brings up a
 
01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:23.990 align:start position:0%
um rick yeah mark also brings up a
really

01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
important other point that is not in the
 
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:26.870 align:start position:0%
important other point that is not in the
bill

01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
um but um but uh representative ames and
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
i have discussed it is dick still here
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yes right there um
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and and dick i think you brought it
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
to um to really our our
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
discussion but as valuations rise
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the five dollar
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
local contribution may need to be
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
adjusted uh downward um um
 
01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:53.430 align:start position:0%
adjusted uh downward um um
uh

01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
given given the fact that the the east
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
the the um you know the 100 of the
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
predicted cost
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
is really stable for
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know for let's say a decade of time
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
so so that's something that i think um
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
you've you've mentioned that we do need
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
to consider that in in in legislation is
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
that right
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and mark that's what you were
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
talking about right yeah just projecting
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
this um you would expect ev to change
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
rise we expect it to rise currently
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
unless there's a real estate market
 
01:47:29.679 --> 01:47:30.629 align:start position:0%
unless there's a real estate market
crash

01:47:30.629 --> 01:47:30.639 align:start position:0%
crash
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's going to certainly impact
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
further just represent porter you have
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
your hand up yeah sort of because
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
it works i just go for it yeah okay so
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand of local
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
valuation plus
 
01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
valuation plus
swept

01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
swept
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
that but the swept money is not being
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
counted as local contribution now that's
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
being counted as
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
state contribution
 
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
state contribution
uh

01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the swept is um
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
the swept is just now under this bill
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
swept is just a
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
tax source to the etf um you don't uh
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
you were
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
municipality gets to retain three
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
percent of it but basically it's just
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
dollars for the etf so when a
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
constituent looks at their tax bill
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to see school tax five
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand swept tax
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
whatever the rate is for that year for
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
swept tax um yeah the the local school
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
tax might be more than five dollars
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
depending on if they want to um uh
 
01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.470 align:start position:0%
depending on if they want to um uh
uh

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
raise additional funds above the state
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right but yes they'll that
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
when a taxpayer is looking at their tax
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
bill under this proposal hb 1680 um
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they'll know that their swept is
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to the education trust fund uh
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
that their community is keeping three
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
percent that it's not one hundred
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
percent uh
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
are there further questions right from
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.629 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mark for
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.430 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
on the transition grants
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
yep am i correct that i could estimate
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
how much less
 
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
a community is going to get in a
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
transition grant from year to year by
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the just at the percentages
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
based upon the original transition grant
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
i see representative ames is nodding his
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
head behind you so a little more than
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
that because
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget goes
 
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.310 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget goes
up

01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
every year too
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay so you have you have both these
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
things sort of converging at the same
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
time as the foundation opportunity
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
budget goes up in the state grant to get
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
you there goes up the transition grants
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
are going down
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
if the transition grant goes down by 10
 
01:50:06.639 --> 01:50:08.790 align:start position:0%
if the transition grant goes down by 10
percent

01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
but the foundation opportunity grant is
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
going up would the difference actually
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
be less than 10
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
on that figure are you are you looking
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
at uh i'm sorry you're are you looking
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
at bedford
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
okay bedford caught my eye as well when
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
i was going through this and i have um i
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
did an analysis on 25 um it's not in
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
front of you but i did look at 25 for
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
bedford because i was curious i saw
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
bedford got that 76 000 uh decrease and
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
i i couldn't off the top of my head i
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't think of why that was and it's
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
because of the cpi adjustment um when
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
comparing 24 current law versus hb 1680
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
proposed law
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
um but i did look at bedford because i
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
thought what representative luna was
 
01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
pointing out what happens to a community
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
like bedford right
 
01:50:51.599 --> 01:50:52.390 align:start position:0%
like bedford right
there

01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
decrease when you increase the annual
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget bedford
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a transition grand town
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
anymore they become a state opportunity
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
grand town okay so so yes so the math
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
could get it's going to move around a
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
little bit but as that foundation
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget increases there'll be
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
less transition towns
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
right in the long term
 
01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:14.550 align:start position:0%
right in the long term
so

01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
how can we predict
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
one million four hundred and fourteen
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar transition grant
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
is that just gone in 2025
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:51:30.719 --> 01:51:31.990 align:start position:0%
uh uh
uh

01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.189 align:start position:0%
uh
us

01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
if we're no longer
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
that transition grant disappears because
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
you're getting a state opportunity grant
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's greater than your 23 numbers
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
you're 23 uh yeah and can did when you
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
did the numbers do you know what the
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
increase in that state opportunity grant
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's on my computer but i can okay i
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
can email you it doesn't have to be now
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to know what the sticker
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
shock is going to be all right thank you
 
01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.189 align:start position:0%
shock is going to be all right thank you
mark

01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
so so what's going to be the the
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
the reaction we get from the loudons in
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
the world and the molten burrows the
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
world and the wolf pearls of the world
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know it's over a million dollars in
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
those communities
 
01:52:25.199 --> 01:52:25.990 align:start position:0%
those communities
um

01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
so so you know and i think this is that
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's a really good um question rick
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
and and i think there's a couple of
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
that that really dr factor into that
 
01:52:36.239 --> 01:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
that that really dr factor into that
conversation

01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
certainly the uh the the discussion
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
last week with respect to
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
towns that raise more through the
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax than
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of an education and whether
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's actually constitutional
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
and um and and that's uh that's
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
certainly that's one of the main
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh considerations behind ways and means
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh continuing to take a look at um at
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
that policy
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know the other um the other piece is
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
is i would say um
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
the uh you know continued series of
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
litigation that we've had here in the
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
state with respect to school funding and
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh ultimately in the
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
conval case it's going to be found
 
01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:25.830 align:start position:0%
conval case it's going to be found
whether

01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.709 align:start position:0%
whether
whether

01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is is providing a
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh funding plan um
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
for school districts or if they're or if
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.030 align:start position:0%
they're not
and

01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and then i think there's the
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
sort of like the i don't want to call it
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
an anecdotal piece but certainly places
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
that have high property tax values uh
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
feel that that somehow they're not being
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
treated fairly in in our school funding
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh design
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know mark's done a tremendous job on
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
this and and uh and i can't wait to be
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
able to sort of sit down with with dick
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and and and go through go through
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
this and and bring some questions back
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh next week on um
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh on this but uh but also the number of
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
students that live in um in districts
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
where uh where they're now seeing their
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.390 align:start position:0%
where uh where they're now seeing their
budgets

01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.589 align:start position:0%
budgets
um

01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
designed so that they can close the
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity gap so that the students in
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
those districts the average student in
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
those districts has a real good shot at
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
a state average outcome as opposed to
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
what their what they what what they're
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
getting right now
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
and when you take a look at the number
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
of students that that are positively
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
affected by a plan um like this it's uh
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's really overwhelming and uh and it's
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
strong at the start and i should say
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's overwhelming after a decade
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
and um and you know these are the things
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
that i think i i certainly am not nearly
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
as eloquent as representative milor is
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
when he talks about
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
closing these gaps and why we do this as
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
a student-centered
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
program as a student-centered policy
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
looking at you know what it's not it's
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
not just the kids in hopkinton i'm
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about but it's the kids in
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
claremonts the kids in newport i talk
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
about newport all the time because it's
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
25 minutes up the road
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
and um and they've got some of the
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
highest taxes in the state and and
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
and honestly
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
the lowest
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes in the state and you know i
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
hate to hang that on any school district
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
but certainly
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
those students
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
deserve better
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
yep we certainly have some issues out
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
there you have the conval going on but
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
you also had londonderry earlier which
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
all students regardless of the community
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
live in whether it's a poverty community
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
or a wealthy community
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
are due an adequate education as we
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
define an adequate education
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
and so you're going to have you know
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
different sides of
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
the coin here coming in and and
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
questioning this
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
so we have our work cut out in front of
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
us here in terms of policy and and i and
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to say that that students
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
in new london certainly
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
certainly they deserve the opportunity
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education as do you know
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
students in wolfeboro and students in
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
newcastle and we had uh
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
bill ardensher come in and say ardently
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
that he sees that this would pass the
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues at least that's
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
what i interpreted from that and then
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to have the opposite saying
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute we have an attorney
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
saying the opposite so
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
regardless how we go it's going to be uh
 
01:56:46.719 --> 01:56:48.709 align:start position:0%
regardless how we go it's going to be uh
contentious

01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
contentious
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and can i ch change
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
the topic just a little bit and talk
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
about charter schools
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
because i i'm very i tried to read the
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
bill on the charter school area and i'm
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm confused
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
so can you just give me a very brief
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know five sentence
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
how are they funded and and how do they
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
work into this and how do their how do
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
their um
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes get measured if they're not
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
required to do what public schools are
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
required to do other public schools i
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
can give you five sentences on all of
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
that so so currently charter schools the
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
the department of education does collect
 
01:57:29.119 --> 01:57:30.229 align:start position:0%
the department of education does collect
performance

01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
performance
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
data on charter schools uh for many
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
charter schools that have
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
disaggregated subgroups that are that
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
are less than 11 in in
 
01:57:41.109 --> 01:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
in student count
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
that data is not reported uh publicly
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
but for those some of the larger charter
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
schools you'll see that the the the data
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
is publicly available regardless the
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
department has the data and they can
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
calculate um you know
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
performance budgets and things like that
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
um currently charter schools are funded
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
um using the per-pupil formula that's in
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
the statute right now they don't receive
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization they do receive
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
factors and they receive another
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know remember thirty five thirty
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
six hundred thirty three hundred dollar
 
01:58:19.599 --> 01:58:20.470 align:start position:0%
six hundred thirty three hundred dollar
kicker

01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
kicker
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but it's it's it's the it's
 
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
the per pupil funding calculated in
 
01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.109 align:start position:0%
the per pupil funding calculated in
9840a

01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
9840a
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
plus an additional 30 300 3400 3500
 
01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:37.990 align:start position:0%
plus an additional 30 300 3400 3500
35

01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
35
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
for non-vlax yep yeah yeah for non-villa
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
and then velox has a different different
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
different funding formula
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
what um
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
what what house bill 1680 does is
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
develop a funding mechanism for school
 
01:58:50.639 --> 01:58:52.629 align:start position:0%
develop a funding mechanism for school
districts

01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
it's all it's it's it's a funding
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism for school districts and how
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
much does it how much does it cost
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
a school district to educate all of its
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
students to a constitutionally
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
defined adequate um
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education that's defined based
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
on outcomes
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um and so so what uh what are in the
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh the sections of the bill
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to charters and they
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
would obviously equally apply to any
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
other per-pupil um um programs like efas
 
01:59:27.199 --> 01:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
other per-pupil um um programs like efas
um

01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
that um that that
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
it needs to be studied that the
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner needs to take a look at
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the way to fund
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
charters what's the way to fund efas
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
what's the way to calculate those uh
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
variables and that's what you bring to
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
the um you know to the to the budget
 
01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:48.470 align:start position:0%
the um you know to the to the budget
discussion

01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh or or codify in statute either way
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
but um but but what we what we do know
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
is that is that is that the basis in
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1680 is uh is is how to fund
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
okay we gotta get we're close to
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
wrapping up for today but
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
what we have is one more subcommittee
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
meeting here this is an early bill
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
so this committee has to make a
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
on where we're going on this we've had
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
now an opportunity to go through the
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
bill and look at those policy
 
02:00:27.199 --> 02:00:28.629 align:start position:0%
bill and look at those policy
considerations

02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
and now we've heard uh gotten the
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets on
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know how to fund this program and
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
where revenues may be coming from or how
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
they're you know broken out over all
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
these towns
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
so we've we've got some basic
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
information here
 
02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
information here
and

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
many just questions been asked
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
i would ask that we all be thinking of
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
further questions to discuss at the next
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
meeting here
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then close that meeting we're gonna
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to make a recommendation either otp
 
02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.550 align:start position:0%
have to make a recommendation either otp
itl

02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
otpa i there's a lot to this and quite
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
frankly i see a lot of study
 
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
to square this away
 
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.350 align:start position:0%
to square this away
in

02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
taking it down maybe some of the other
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
alternatives we've just discussed today
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
that i don't think we're going to have
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
all those answers so i don't want to you
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
know be saying this is how we have to go
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
be be looking at this in between this
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
week here and come up if you have any
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
questions i know everybody will run back
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
and look at the line for their community
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
look at as a whole for the student in
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
the state statewide that's what it's all
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
about so
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
any other discussion from the committee
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mark thank you rick
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
and members of the campaign dick i
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to apologize for my questioning
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
assessment portion i had not read
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
thoroughly that section that

you

03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:11.840 --> 03:04:07.830 align:start position:0%

03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:45.840 --> 03:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:40.309 --> 03:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
i think we might as well get started
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
here but five after people may still be
 
03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
parking and all that but uh
 
03:07:46.469 --> 03:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
we'll get started
 
03:07:51.429 --> 03:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh as i was talking just on the side uh
 
03:07:53.349 --> 03:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on right now in the
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
university system and they're in
 
03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
transition but in my discussion with you
 
03:07:58.720 --> 03:07:59.670 align:start position:0%
transition but in my discussion with you
uh

03:07:59.670 --> 03:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
even though they're actively engaged in
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations and all that uh i gather
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's therapy your opinion here that uh
 
03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that need not interfere with our having
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
this discussion that we're having
 
03:08:11.600 --> 03:08:12.710 align:start position:0%
this discussion that we're having
concerning

03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh how best to a the
 
03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
community college system in uh
 
03:08:20.070 --> 03:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
delivering its programs and attracting
 
03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
students and retaining them
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so i think we'll continue today
 
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
with just your input back
 
03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:32.389 align:start position:0%
with just your input back
um

03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
with possibly the idea that it won't be
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to have another meeting
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
if we just set up a process by which
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
we're able to continue
 
03:08:41.279 --> 03:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
we're able to continue
uh

03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other about
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
what's in progress and and how we may
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
assist you in improving access in the
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
is there anything in the committee at
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
this point that anyone wanted to bring
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i apologize i couldn't stay at the
 
03:09:04.710 --> 03:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
last meeting right through to
 
03:09:07.110 --> 03:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh three o'clock or 3 30. i don't know
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
when you left
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
what i did is i left early
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i went up and had a meeting with
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
president don burks at psu
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
a real good meeting we discussed a
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
number of topics but we also discussed
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the relationship he has with kids
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
that are coming down from white mountain
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
to plymouth state
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that maybe perhaps have the
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
associates degree and how
 
03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
president burks is addressing that in
 
03:09:38.469 --> 03:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
terms of when they get engaged and
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
matriculated towards a four-year degree
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i shared with him
 
03:09:48.150 --> 03:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
the legislation that i had obtained i
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
did a search with the education
 
03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
commission in the states and looked at
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
all states in the country in terms of
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
do they accept an associate's degree
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
from their community college system and
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
at the university level
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
of going on and getting that four-year
 
03:10:08.070 --> 03:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
degree so that the student that's
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
applying doesn't have to go and jump a
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
lot of hoops and then a lot more
 
03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
expenses to take certain courses which
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
not have been uh
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
aligned with the
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
the where the uh they need for the
 
03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
the where the uh they need for the
four-year

03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i showed him the
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
sample legislation we had from tennessee
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
and he had already been familiar with
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
some of the things going on there seeing
 
03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
some of the things going on there seeing
that

03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:34.229 --> 03:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
tennessee's i guess made quite a few
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
gains in terms of relationship between
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
the community college system and the
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
four-year schools
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that's in fact when we looked at
 
03:10:44.070 --> 03:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation earlier for concurrent dual
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment the the manner which we
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
adopted ours was exactly what wyoming
 
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
was doing they have seven community
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
colleges there that go on to a similar
 
03:10:55.830 --> 03:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
type university system so
 
03:10:55.840 --> 03:10:56.710 align:start position:0%
type university system so
um

03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
we looked at tennessee and i gave him
 
03:11:00.870 --> 03:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
the sample legislation he said this
 
03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
looks good this is what we are wanting
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
to do and in fact are doing at uh
 
03:11:08.950 --> 03:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
plymouth state
 
03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
so what i've done is i've gone ahead and
 
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
worked with legislative services last
 
03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:14.469 align:start position:0%
worked with legislative services last
week

03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
and had an amendment put together
 
03:11:17.439 --> 03:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
and had an amendment put together
which

03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
everywhere tennessee was new hampshire
 
03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
is and it basically says an associate
 
03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
science or associate of arts degree
 
03:11:28.309 --> 03:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
graduate from any institution
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
in community college system of new
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire shall be deemed to have met
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
all general education and university
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
parallel core requirements for transfer
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
to any institution in the university
 
03:11:42.150 --> 03:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire as a junior
 
03:11:44.389 --> 03:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
and then part two not withstanding
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and this is where
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
president burks and i had some
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
discussion uh admission into a
 
03:11:51.670 --> 03:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
particular program school or college
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
within a university in the community
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
community system in new hampshire
 
03:11:58.389 --> 03:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
shall remain competitive in accordance
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
with general applicable policies
 
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
so that you're wanting to come in with
 
03:12:04.790 --> 03:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
your general ed background from the
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
associates or you want to get into
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
engineering obviously
 
03:12:10.070 --> 03:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
you may have to look at the policies
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
that that program is run by and you may
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
not have what's necessary but you could
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
come in as a general liberal arts type
 
03:12:19.349 --> 03:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
you know student
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
so i put this forward for a discussion
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
today because it may it's associated
 
03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:25.429 align:start position:0%
today because it may it's associated
with

03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
the the idea of the community college
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
being offering four-year degrees but
 
03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
this is just backing it off a step or
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
two and the four-year degree would be
 
03:12:37.830 --> 03:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
offered by the
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
four-year accredited school but the
 
03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
associate's degree would lead towards
 
03:12:45.269 --> 03:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
that uh first portion of that four-year
 
03:12:45.279 --> 03:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
that uh first portion of that four-year
degree

03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i put this together so we could have
 
03:12:51.510 --> 03:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
that discussion today
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
seems logical to me
 
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
but uh there again too it hasn't it's
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
only been passed by
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
one one college our one university
 
03:13:03.030 --> 03:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
president at this time so
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just offer that out for
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and probably work with today
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
03:13:11.349 --> 03:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
it may help us get to the end zone we
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
want to get to
 
03:13:14.389 --> 03:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of the other issues that are going
 
03:13:14.399 --> 03:13:15.349 align:start position:0%
a lot of the other issues that are going
on

03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
can be dealt with through the higher
 
03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
education study committee which is a
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
statutory committee between the senate
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
and the house and it's met once this
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
year i'm sure we're going to have to
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
meet many more times this year
 
03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:28.389 align:start position:0%
meet many more times this year
but

03:13:28.389 --> 03:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:13:31.269 --> 03:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
i also would suggest that
 
03:13:31.279 --> 03:13:32.070 align:start position:0%
i also would suggest that
the

03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:13:34.469 --> 03:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways that issues like
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
this can be resolved
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
at the local level by that i mean at the
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
community college level and at the
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
university level without statutory
 
03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:45.030 align:start position:0%
university level without statutory
uh

03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
rationale or
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislation i put this forward though
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
with the idea that
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
this is going to put the message out to
 
03:13:57.030 --> 03:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in our state that kids are
 
03:13:59.670 --> 03:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
finishing the community college system
 
03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
hey i'd be interested in knowing if they
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
should come out of a massachusetts
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
school with an associate's degree
 
03:14:08.550 --> 03:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
whether they would come in the same way
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's a possible way to attract students
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
from out of state and we're competing
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
after that same demographic maybe this
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
way to really attract them to our own
 
03:14:37.190 --> 03:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
the world's going to hear you mrs
 
03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:44.950 align:start position:0%
the world's going to hear you mrs
preventure

03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
preventure
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and now members of
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
catherine provencher i serve as the
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
chief administrative officer of the
 
03:14:54.389 --> 03:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
university system
 
03:14:54.399 --> 03:14:55.510 align:start position:0%
university system
um

03:14:55.510 --> 03:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
i so thank you very much representative
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
vlad for for the amendment um
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is the first time i've we've had an
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it so
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
my initial reaction is i need to do a
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more research
 
03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:10.710 align:start position:0%
little bit more research
the

03:15:10.710 --> 03:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would just point out
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
i would say this isn't just relative to
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
community college system degrees
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
and representative ford i believe you
 
03:15:24.229 --> 03:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's important to make
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
sure that we aid the community college
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
system students and of course it is but
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's about access
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
to public higher education in the
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
granite state in its entirety
 
03:15:37.590 --> 03:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
rather than just the community college
 
03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
rather than just the community college
system

03:15:38.950 --> 03:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
again the first another
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
initial thing that jumps out to me is
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the effective date within 60 days of
 
03:15:45.040 --> 03:15:46.229 align:start position:0%
the effective date within 60 days of
passage

03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
passage
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how long it would take to
 
03:15:52.469 --> 03:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
facilitate all this work when i look at
 
03:15:55.990 --> 03:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
the the tennessee statute and forgive me
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know enough about the structure
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
of tennessee's statute but when i look
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
at the language
 
03:16:03.429 --> 03:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
the the piece that an associate of
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
science or associate of arts
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
degree from a tennessee community
 
03:16:12.070 --> 03:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
college is deemed to have met all the
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
general education
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and university parallel core
 
03:16:15.920 --> 03:16:17.190 align:start position:0%
and university parallel core
requirements

03:16:17.190 --> 03:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:16:19.750 --> 03:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
is under a subsection
 
03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:20.790 align:start position:0%
is under a subsection
where

03:16:20.790 --> 03:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:21.750 align:start position:0%
where
um

03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
all state institutions of higher
 
03:16:25.750 --> 03:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
education have collaborated and
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
developed a transfer pathway for at
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
least 50 undergraduate majors so
 
03:16:30.960 --> 03:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
least 50 undergraduate majors so
again

03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
i have not researched this but from the
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
plain language it looks like a pathway
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
for 50 majors was
 
03:16:42.150 --> 03:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
already set up
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then those associate of science and
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
associate of arts
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
transferred over and i'm sure the
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
chancellor president lloyd can
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
answer questions about
 
03:16:55.990 --> 03:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
some of the curriculum and all of the
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
associate of science and associate of
 
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
arts degrees at the community college i
 
03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
just don't know enough about the core
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum for all of their associate's
 
03:17:05.439 --> 03:17:06.550 align:start position:0%
curriculum for all of their associate's
degrees

03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
and do they all transfer into the
 
03:17:12.550 --> 03:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
general education requirements at the
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
four-year schools
 
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
the this right here
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah there were a whole slug of them out
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.389 --> 03:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:17:53.750 --> 03:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
mark rubenstein on behalf of the
 
03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
we actually see this as as
 
03:18:01.510 --> 03:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
a helpful and constructive step
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
our our commitment to our students
 
03:18:07.030 --> 03:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
focuses on the programs that we offer
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
we serve to educate
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the expectation whether it's a
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
physics course or
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
and we believe we teach that
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
with quality the same concepts that that
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
would be found in any other institute
 
03:18:26.790 --> 03:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institution
 
03:18:28.950 --> 03:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
so for us in a lot of ways not only is
 
03:18:28.960 --> 03:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
so for us in a lot of ways not only is
this

03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:29.760 --> 03:18:30.630 align:start position:0%
this
uh

03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
clear about the efficiency for students
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
and contributing to affordability
 
03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:35.670 align:start position:0%
and contributing to affordability
through

03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
pathways that don't require repeating
 
03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
courses but it reinforces that
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
commitment to quality that the
 
03:18:43.590 --> 03:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
consistency that you would expect
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
whether you're learning in berlin
 
03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
whether you're learning in littleton
 
03:18:48.550 --> 03:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
whether you're learning in durham
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
is what we would expect too
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
so we we see this as a constructive step
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh as you note in the second paragraph
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
represent vlad the
 
03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
amendment would still require admission
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
to a program the still expectations are
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
established by the university system for
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
receiving students into those programs
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
but students otherwise eligible to be in
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
those programs wouldn't necessarily need
 
03:19:14.309 --> 03:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
to repeat coursework that in fact is is
 
03:19:16.630 --> 03:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
demonstrated as consistent within the
 
03:19:20.950 --> 03:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:23.190 --> 03:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know enough about the
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
the curriculum and the associates
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
and actually um chancellor you might
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
know because you can sit on both sides
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the table here so
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
all of the the all of the curriculum can
 
03:19:35.429 --> 03:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
you put the mic in a little closer all
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
for all of the associate's degrees
 
03:19:42.550 --> 03:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
issued by the community college
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
in your opinion would meet all of the
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
gen ed requirements
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
for programs that are designed for
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go back and forth here for
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
just a minute but that that's a key
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
point for programs that are designed for
 
03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:08.469 align:start position:0%
point for programs that are designed for
transfer

03:20:08.469 --> 03:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
which gets me back to the first section
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
tennessee statute that talks about a
 
03:20:16.550 --> 03:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
transfer pathway
 
03:20:19.590 --> 03:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
where the amendment doesn't talk about
 
03:20:49.830 --> 03:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.950 --> 03:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
well first of all i i put this out just
 
03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
to really steer some conversation and
 
03:21:00.309 --> 03:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
the direction and really to respond to
 
03:21:03.190 --> 03:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
what i had heard
 
03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
what i had heard
from

03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
some others that
 
03:21:09.429 --> 03:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money and time put into
 
03:21:11.910 --> 03:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
these associate degrees
 
03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:13.429 align:start position:0%
these associate degrees
and

03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
and coming from a
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
a perspective that when i'm looking at
 
03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
our high school curriculum we're now
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
looking at it not by course but we're
 
03:21:25.190 --> 03:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking at by competencies
 
03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
do those competencies that are required
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
for a student even at the
 
03:21:32.710 --> 03:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
collegiate level or the post-secondary
 
03:21:32.720 --> 03:21:34.309 align:start position:0%
collegiate level or the post-secondary
level

03:21:34.309 --> 03:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:21:37.349 --> 03:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
are the competencies there
 
03:21:40.229 --> 03:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
through that associate degree be it for
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
a associate's degree in the science or
 
03:21:45.349 --> 03:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
associate of arts
 
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
do they parallel with the competencies
 
03:21:50.229 --> 03:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
are necessary for a person to enter in
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
the junior year of of
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
four-year degree
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
when i was in the service there were a
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
number of courses or
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
areas where i received competency from
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
the university of maryland
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
for my participation in various programs
 
03:22:12.229 --> 03:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
within the us army
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
without having to do it through the
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
specific another college or some other
 
03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
place i got they granted me credit for
 
03:22:22.710 --> 03:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
that i sort of like i think what
 
03:22:22.720 --> 03:22:23.670 align:start position:0%
that i sort of like i think what
uh

03:22:23.670 --> 03:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh dr rubinstein's done with the some of
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
the programs while he was at granite
 
03:22:28.479 --> 03:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
the programs while he was at granite
state

03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
um i i feel that there's there's really
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
a need
 
03:22:34.479 --> 03:22:36.309 align:start position:0%
a need
to

03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
support those students that come in with
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
the associate's degree so they don't
 
03:22:41.190 --> 03:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
have to start taking courses all over
 
03:22:43.750 --> 03:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
again if we're not aligned down below we
 
03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
need to be aligned
 
03:22:49.830 --> 03:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.840 --> 03:22:51.030 align:start position:0%
 
credits

03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
credits
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you get at one level that stacks up
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
and leads towards that other end which i
 
03:22:59.269 --> 03:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
think that that's something that the
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
the four-year system is
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
has definitely thought of and hopefully
 
03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
working towards at different levels i
 
03:23:07.510 --> 03:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a statutory
 
03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a statutory
responsibility

03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
that can be done through your your
 
03:23:12.630 --> 03:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
boards that you have the administrative
 
03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
board and all that between the
 
03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
presidents and and working with staff
 
03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:17.830 align:start position:0%
presidents and and working with staff
um

03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's just that we're running out a lot
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
of time we need to get on this and move
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
quickly here there's a lot going on at
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
the higher education levels in terms of
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
restructuring and organizing and and
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
trying to capture the students from all
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
over new england and beyond to come to
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
our schools here and i think this is one
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
way of doing it so yes uh we do have
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
copies of the tennessee bill i think you
 
03:23:43.590 --> 03:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
had it i gave you a copy
 
03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i if it's transfer i'd like to see
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
us work something here where we can come
 
03:23:51.910 --> 03:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
out with language which is supportive of
 
03:23:53.670 --> 03:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
03:23:56.790 --> 03:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
goal and and get something moving along
 
03:23:56.800 --> 03:23:57.670 align:start position:0%
goal and and get something moving along
here

03:23:57.670 --> 03:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:23:59.190 --> 03:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:24:00.870 --> 03:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
an outcome can be
 
03:24:02.950 --> 03:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
told to our public that yeah you got
 
03:24:04.790 --> 03:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
that associate's degree you can go earn
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
a four-year degree
 
03:24:08.710 --> 03:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
go for it and you won't have to spend
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
more money in replicating what you were
 
03:24:11.279 --> 03:24:12.389 align:start position:0%
more money in replicating what you were
told

03:24:12.389 --> 03:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
told
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know that was
 
03:24:16.469 --> 03:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
working towards a college degree and do
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
it again
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
to me there's i think we can go beyond
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
that and i do concur with
 
03:24:25.510 --> 03:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
president marx at psu i think it's a
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
03:24:27.750 --> 03:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:24:29.510 --> 03:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
what if you know where they're coming
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
from with what they have then we should
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
be and it's within our state community
 
03:24:36.389 --> 03:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
college system and our state university
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
system we gotta tie these two
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
organizations together so that we're not
 
03:24:42.309 --> 03:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
losing time and money on the part of a
 
03:24:42.319 --> 03:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
losing time and money on the part of a
student

03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
just to step in and clarify one issue
 
03:24:51.429 --> 03:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
though that i did hear from a little bit
 
03:24:51.439 --> 03:24:52.309 align:start position:0%
though that i did hear from a little bit
of

03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
no one is saying that you
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
should be exempted from taking
 
03:24:59.190 --> 03:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
prerequisites for a required course
 
03:25:01.670 --> 03:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's not any idea of that at all the
 
03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
gen ed thing is just
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
just the idea that basically if you pass
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
gen ed requirements in any institution
 
03:25:11.429 --> 03:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it should satisfy that
 
03:25:14.550 --> 03:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
requirement in all other institutions
 
03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
requirement in all other institutions
that

03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
will never protect you from the faculty
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
members they didn't teach english
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
history the way i teach it look we live
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
with these creatures
 
03:25:26.710 --> 03:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
we know them and we just say no no no
 
03:25:29.030 --> 03:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you charlie and sit down you know
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
03:25:32.870 --> 03:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
that will always be the case we had
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
someone in a
 
03:25:37.190 --> 03:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
high school who was saying that their
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
chemistry course couldn't be replicated
 
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere else you had to take it right
 
03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
there you couldn't get a high school
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
diploma from them
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
we all deal with these kinds of things
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
in academe
 
03:25:50.950 --> 03:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're talking about
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about if you're
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
requiring some kind of social
 
03:25:57.429 --> 03:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
studies or other things that this course
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
at this university should be equivalent
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
to the one over there that is the
 
03:26:01.439 --> 03:26:02.469 align:start position:0%
to the one over there that is the
principle

03:26:02.469 --> 03:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
principle
 
03:26:05.349 --> 03:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
that's being required not the
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
course specific kind of representative
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
ford i'd like to add one last thing on
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
line 12 of this proposed legislation
 
03:26:16.229 --> 03:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm open to a you know modifying in
 
03:26:19.190 --> 03:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
any way it says university parallel core
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for transfer
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about transfer there
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
and meeting requirements to get into
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that particular program you might be
 
03:26:30.710 --> 03:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
wanting to get into it's contingent upon
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
those aligning and meeting the
 
03:26:34.710 --> 03:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of the program you're
 
03:26:37.110 --> 03:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
transferring into if they don't then you
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
have the option at the university level
 
03:26:43.349 --> 03:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're simply requiring you to take in a
 
03:26:47.110 --> 03:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
different math course that's more
 
03:26:48.950 --> 03:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
advanced than the one you took for the
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
gen ed requirement that's
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
fairly customary if i understand
 
03:26:56.710 --> 03:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
in my experience at any rate
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
oliver can i ask a question please jump
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
in uh i'm going back to our meeting last
 
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
week last week
 
03:27:05.269 --> 03:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
i seem to recall i need some help with
 
03:27:05.279 --> 03:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
i seem to recall i need some help with
this

03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
that there was there were either
 
03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
discussions or an agreement between
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
white mountain community college and
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
plymouth to take
 
03:27:15.439 --> 03:27:16.630 align:start position:0%
plymouth to take
i'm

03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:27:17.910 --> 03:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i want to use the word
 
03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
program but take chunks of
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
of of sort of
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah programs that students had
 
03:27:27.510 --> 03:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
completed and those were part of the
 
03:27:30.150 --> 03:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
sort of the agreement if that's the case
 
03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:31.190 align:start position:0%
sort of the agreement if that's the case
then

03:27:31.190 --> 03:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
we've got the beginnings of a pathway
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
between white mountain and plymouth at
 
03:27:35.520 --> 03:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
between white mountain and plymouth at
least

03:27:36.790 --> 03:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
least
 
03:27:39.190 --> 03:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
it seems to be that would be moving in
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
the direction where we would want to be
 
03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:42.870 align:start position:0%
the direction where we would want to be
moving

03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
i need clarification i guess
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
to be sure i'm interpreting that
 
03:27:47.040 --> 03:27:48.710 align:start position:0%
to be sure i'm interpreting that
correctly

03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
03:27:50.950 --> 03:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure can i just respond to that mr chair
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
please so and i want to be clear it's
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily just white mountains
 
03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
with plymouth state the community
 
03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
college system has what's called a block
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
chance uh block transfer or the chunk i
 
03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
like just as well uh the block transfer
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that is for general education but
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
also it's expanded to uh certain
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
programs uh business as a program human
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
services education we've gotten to the
 
03:28:11.670 --> 03:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
point where a lot of those really align
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
very well and do transfer in
 
03:28:15.670 --> 03:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
i will also just highlight of that's
 
03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
plymouth state you know we have that as
 
03:28:18.790 --> 03:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
a community college system we have a
 
03:28:21.190 --> 03:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
block transfer there i'll work backwards
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
i was a keen state graduate my undergrad
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
and you know at that point we were
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
working you know course by course so at
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
the time i went back to nhti and i said
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
which courses actually go to keene state
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
as a transfer so we're still doing some
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
of those one-offs with some of the other
 
03:28:36.710 --> 03:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
institutions i would say plymouth is a
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
little further beyond
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
not mentioning granite state by any
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
means but keene state and in the
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
university system
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire and durham
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have the block
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
transfer with as many as plymouth state
 
03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:52.070 align:start position:0%
transfer with as many as plymouth state
does

03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
we talked about last
 
03:28:55.429 --> 03:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
week though
 
03:28:57.510 --> 03:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of there are
 
03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
agreements and a number of programs from
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
all of the community college system
 
03:29:03.359 --> 03:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
all of the community college system
schools

03:29:04.950 --> 03:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:05.750 align:start position:0%
schools
to

03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
i know the university
 
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
that all those gen ed courses will be
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
accepted and transferred in it's just my
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
again i apologize
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is my first time seeing the
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
language and the amendment it reads that
 
03:29:23.429 --> 03:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
an associates associate of science or
 
03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
associate of arts degree graduate from
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
any institution in ccsnh
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed to have met all general
 
03:29:34.229 --> 03:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
education and university parallel course
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
requirements for transfer
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
to any institution as a junior
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i just
 
03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
maybe president lloyd do all associate
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
of arts and associate of science degrees
 
03:29:51.269 --> 03:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
at the community college system
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum such a you know that you
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned business and social science
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
and all of that i just don't know
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think i'd be remiss if i i didn't say
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
there you know some of it depends i mean
 
03:30:09.269 --> 03:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
there is not an exact uh transfer to
 
03:30:11.030 --> 03:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
every single school that you know every
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
credit is taken in you know and i'll use
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
the applicability term once again as
 
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
well if not always applicable the
 
03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
general education tends to go intro to
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
sociology intro to psych uh you know
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
some of those the quantitative reasoning
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
math you know some of those the more
 
03:30:27.670 --> 03:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
basic level tend to go english go but
 
03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the specific program
 
03:30:32.550 --> 03:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
plymouth state may say intro to business
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
comes in absolutely and here's all of
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
these but it may not because there's a
 
03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
separate paul college of business out at
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
unh for example
 
03:30:40.950 --> 03:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
liberal arts will go because it's a
 
03:30:42.550 --> 03:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
college of liberal arts you know all of
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
our liberal arts will go on there but
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
the engineering school may not so there
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
is not a blanket but i do want to take a
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
half a step back and also say at the
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
community college level our associate
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
degrees are all designed to be
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
transferable that is the intent in our
 
03:30:58.550 --> 03:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
advisory boards our advisory committees
 
03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time making sure that
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
they are transferable i will also say
 
03:31:05.190 --> 03:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
the receiving institutions uh all have
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
different programs and courses so even
 
03:31:09.190 --> 03:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
though it may be transferable to one
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
institution it's not necessarily
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
transferable to a multitude of
 
03:31:12.720 --> 03:31:14.309 align:start position:0%
transferable to a multitude of
institutions

03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up question to what you
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
just said
 
03:31:17.279 --> 03:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
just said
um

03:31:18.150 --> 03:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
is it not possible sometimes at least it
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't my experience so i'm asking if it
 
03:31:25.349 --> 03:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
isn't yours
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
to transfer in credits that may not
 
03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
fulfill this particular requirement or
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
accept it as free electives
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
so they transfer all the credits they
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't lose any college credits they just
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
may have some more requirements they
 
03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
have to meet in their new program sure
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
that's very true i think that happens
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
probably more often than not yeah
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
if if i might replicate it before ju
 
03:31:49.110 --> 03:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
just to add
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
within an institution
 
03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
a student at a university who starts as
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
a liberal arts student finishes the
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
first two years as a junior still would
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
not have satisfied the requirements for
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
junior standing in the engineering
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
program at that same institution so some
 
03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
of this is really the alignment between
 
03:32:09.990 --> 03:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
the two-year program and the four-year
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
that the student is pursuing so i don't
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
think this was intended to overcome and
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
the second clause of the proposed
 
03:32:17.830 --> 03:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that talks about the
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
prerequisites and the admission i think
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
still speaks to the need for a student
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
to have a plan in the first two years
 
03:32:26.469 --> 03:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
that maps to the third and fourth year
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
for the four-year degree
 
03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
oh i i quite agree in my own experience
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else care to pick up on that
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
mr uh chair
 
03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
if if i if i may i have to uh follow up
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
on dr lloyd's uh comment about
 
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
personally and should i in my view
 
03:32:47.670 --> 03:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
have some discretion as to what they
 
03:32:47.680 --> 03:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
have some discretion as to what they
accept

03:32:48.950 --> 03:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
accept
 
03:32:50.469 --> 03:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
to personalize this a little bit i
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
transferred from the university of new
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire to plymouth state many many
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
many many years ago
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
and at that time um plymouth did not
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
recognize plus degrees in other words i
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
had some pl b plus or c plus two anyway
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
the um plymouth would not take the the
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
plus so my b plus turned into a b for
 
03:33:12.070 --> 03:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
example at plymouth now that that's
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
probably probably been changed but
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's a policy of the accepting
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
institution that i think needs some
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
respect so i have a couple questions one
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
of which is
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
english composition is a fairly
 
03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
english composition is a fairly
universal

03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
universal
 
03:33:27.190 --> 03:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
requirement wherever
 
03:33:28.710 --> 03:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
so if
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
in many cases the receiving institution
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
insists on
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
a c or better so my first question is if
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
a student at a community college get a d
 
03:33:42.550 --> 03:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
in say english composition
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
by the the proposed language that miss
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
prevention just
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
focused on which i am too
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like that dee would have
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
to be accepted by the receiving
 
03:33:52.960 --> 03:33:54.550 align:start position:0%
to be accepted by the receiving
institution

03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
institution
 
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:33:58.830 --> 03:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
am i reading that correctly and is that
 
03:34:03.030 --> 03:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
except i would just have a follow-up
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
question and ask if it is coming as
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
intended to come over as a sole course
 
03:34:10.710 --> 03:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
or a whole degree because if it comes as
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
part of a whole degree that had been
 
03:34:14.150 --> 03:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
granted and is buried in there and comes
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
as blocks transferred the credits come
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily the grade
 
03:34:19.349 --> 03:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
so i guess it would depend if you want
 
03:34:21.670 --> 03:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
to just bring the course over a basket
 
03:34:24.550 --> 03:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
of courses versus the entire degree
 
03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
so the d
 
03:34:25.600 --> 03:34:26.389 align:start position:0%
so the d
would

03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
so accepting the course that had a
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
degrade in it would depend upon if it
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
was coming as a folder it's part of the
 
03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:33.990 align:start position:0%
was coming as a folder it's part of the
package

03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
package
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
so the the credits would come
 
03:34:37.590 --> 03:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
but not
 
03:34:40.229 --> 03:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
the great like if i get a d in english
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
comp and east everything else in my
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
program got the associate degree my gpa
 
03:34:47.190 --> 03:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
was 2.8 and i wanted to go to plymouth
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
state as a block transfer they would
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
take the degree not necessarily any of
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
the gpa the grades they would take the
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
credits to walk in okay so even with a d
 
03:34:58.309 --> 03:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
they would take the credit it sounds
 
03:34:58.319 --> 03:34:59.110 align:start position:0%
they would take the credit it sounds
like

03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay and my second question um
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
again going back to lines 20 to 23
 
03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:06.790 align:start position:0%
again going back to lines 20 to 23
um

03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
a program like radiography which i
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned last week or dental hygiene at
 
03:35:14.070 --> 03:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
nhci which i have a little more familiar
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
familiarity with
 
03:35:15.680 --> 03:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
familiarity with
um

03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:16.800 --> 03:35:18.070 align:start position:0%
um
would

03:35:18.070 --> 03:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:35:19.349 --> 03:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
again typically the receiving
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
institution will look at the proposed
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
courses coming in and say okay the
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
designation of this course and the
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
course description doesn't match
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
perfectly with ours but it's close
 
03:35:30.950 --> 03:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
enough we can call it whatever
 
03:35:33.190 --> 03:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
but something like uh dental hygiene
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
where there's no
 
03:35:34.640 --> 03:35:35.510 align:start position:0%
where there's no
uh

03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
comparative course to my knowledge in
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:41.110 align:start position:0%
the university system
um

03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
the language here looks like it would
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
mandate that the dental hygiene courses
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
be accepted and and i'm a little
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about that is that how you i
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
think ms prevents your kind of drilled
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
down on that piece of it so i'm kind of
 
03:35:57.110 --> 03:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
sharing her concern and my question
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
is what would happen to dental hygiene
 
03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:00.630 align:start position:0%
is what would happen to dental hygiene
courses

03:36:00.630 --> 03:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
courses
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
or radiography
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
well if i might and again goes back to
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
the question of the alignment of the
 
03:36:08.550 --> 03:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
first two years in the last two years
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
none of the university system programs
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
are lead to a bachelor's degree in
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
dental hygiene
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
but a lot of programs
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
require about a third 120 credits about
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
a third of those credits are general
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
education about if they're those credits
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
are the major and if they're those
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
credits are elected i'd say you've had
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
you'd have a transfer student who had an
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
awful lot of elective credits in dental
 
03:36:29.920 --> 03:36:31.830 align:start position:0%
awful lot of elective credits in dental
hygiene

03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
hygiene
 
03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
and have relatively little flexibility
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
to complete the bachelor's degree with
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
the last 60 credits of the program but
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
again it would be the degree and junior
 
03:36:42.950 --> 03:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
standing the credits transferring but
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
largely as elective
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
i see so the so the credits the dental
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
hygiene credits would not proof be
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
raised to go away they just could not be
 
03:36:55.110 --> 03:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
applied to the uh to a
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
formal degree in the university system
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
if there's no comparable department
 
03:37:03.030 --> 03:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
within the university system to apply
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
those credits toward a particular major
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
then then yes i think they would simply
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
be transferable as elective credits now
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
again this this is a lot easier for me
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
to say sitting on the community college
 
03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
side of the table than the university
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
system side of the table
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm simply thinking through a
 
03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:21.190 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm simply thinking through a
typical

03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
typical
 
03:37:23.190 --> 03:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
degree in a liberal arts program whether
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's english or history or philosophy
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
where a significant component of the
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
degree program is in fact elective and
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
although a student may choose to use
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
that to explore other areas maybe
 
03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
develop a second major or a minor in
 
03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
this case the student would be bringing
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of dental hygiene courses
 
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
that that probably would
 
03:37:45.190 --> 03:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
fill the elective bucket
 
03:37:47.030 --> 03:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay so they'd be considered as
 
03:37:49.830 --> 03:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
electives and they would count but not
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
towards the degree but as electives as
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
you said they'd have okay a lot of
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.600 --> 03:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:03.190 --> 03:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm not that familiar with the
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
university system um but
 
03:38:09.030 --> 03:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
i live up near colby sawyer college and
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
um was an adjunct there
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
and i know that
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
the nursing program which was one of
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
their big programs
 
03:38:17.429 --> 03:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
they had to qualify
 
03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:20.309 align:start position:0%
they had to qualify
from

03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
i believe it was their sophomore year
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
to actually get accepted into that
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
program and the qualifications were
 
03:38:30.150 --> 03:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know largely due to not only the
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
courses they took but also their grade
 
03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
courses they took but also their grade
level

03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that university system
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
probably works on the same premise on
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
a certain high
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know pre-med maybe and nursing and
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the other
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
advanced that you know pre-law the ones
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
that are going to go on to an advanced
 
03:38:53.349 --> 03:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
degree in some way or expect it to could
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
you talk about that please
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative uh thank you for
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
the question and that i i'm guessing
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
that was what paragraph
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
two in lines 14 to 16 on representative
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
vlad's amendment are
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
trying to address
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the nursing programs are extremely
 
03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:12.229 align:start position:0%
the the nursing programs are extremely
competitive

03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
um to be accepted into even from people
 
03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
um to be accepted into even from people
within

03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
within
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
could be a freshman or a sophomore at
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
unh and you might not get into the the
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
nursing program engineering is another
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
highly competitive program
 
03:39:27.830 --> 03:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
at unh
 
03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:29.110 align:start position:0%
at unh
um

03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i i believe
 
03:39:33.990 --> 03:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative ladd that was the reason
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
for paragraph two in your amendment
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
well that comes straight out of the
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
tennessee law as well so i would i would
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
assume then
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
that yes there you
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
the program remains comparative and in
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
accordance with the policies of the
 
03:39:49.990 --> 03:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
institution you're in program you're
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
transferring into
 
03:39:51.920 --> 03:39:52.710 align:start position:0%
transferring into
so

03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
as a as a four-year school you can say
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
match up what's needed for this
 
03:40:00.870 --> 03:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
but you can come in as a junior
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
and and try to get in that program after
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
you've messed around with us a little
 
03:40:08.309 --> 03:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
bit if they even get accepted in that
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
program you've got to be uh
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
qualified to get into approach i think
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this is saying
 
03:40:16.710 --> 03:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
i i would say it's saying right there in
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
line 15 and 16 or down below on the
 
03:40:22.630 --> 03:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
lower side on 25 to 26.
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
may i just have a follow-up that that
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things i think that
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
is bothering me about this is the
 
03:40:32.710 --> 03:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
accepted as a junior
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm having issue with i i have no
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
problem with them
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
accepting credits and coming in as a
 
03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
package and that sort of thing but it
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
seems to have that written in granite
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
for no
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
other analogy that um it would be
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for first you know people in
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
in nursing and and some of these
 
03:40:54.870 --> 03:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
veterinary science some of the highly
 
03:40:54.880 --> 03:40:56.070 align:start position:0%
veterinary science some of the highly
competitive

03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
03:40:56.080 --> 03:41:03.590 align:start position:0%
competitive
areas

03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative if i may say
 
03:41:07.590 --> 03:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
because the community college system
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
offers nursing programs at all of our
 
03:41:10.160 --> 03:41:11.429 align:start position:0%
offers nursing programs at all of our
campuses

03:41:11.429 --> 03:41:11.439 align:start position:0%

03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
a student who's completed the degree
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
from us the first two years
 
03:41:18.469 --> 03:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
is a nurse
 
03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:20.720 align:start position:0%

03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:24.870 align:start position:0%
academically qualified university system
has

03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
rn to bsn programs notably at gsc i
 
03:41:30.150 --> 03:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
think unh may be offering one now as
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
well that allows students to come in for
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
that junior and senior year with junior
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
standing in fact in granite state
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
program come in
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
after the third year with senior
 
03:41:40.479 --> 03:41:41.670 align:start position:0%
after the third year with senior
standing

03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
standing
 
03:41:44.150 --> 03:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
so so the model is there maybe that was
 
03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
a bad
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh analogy because like i said i know
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
that kobe sawyer nursing is a very
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
hard program to get into
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
as they come in
 
03:41:54.880 --> 03:41:55.590 align:start position:0%
as they come in
and

03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
but i i i think it would be
 
03:42:00.070 --> 03:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to immediately say that they
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
would have junior status i mean i i
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
think some of them
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
might come in you know with
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
credits that would only take them to
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a sophomore and a half or whatever
 
03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know how much of a big deal that
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
is at the university level the status of
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
what year you're in
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's usually based on the number of
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
credits i think that you've accumulated
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
and if i may follow representative
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the arcane world of registrars
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
normally and it varies a little bit 56
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
58 or 60 credits brings you junior
 
03:42:34.710 --> 03:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
standing and to complete one of our
 
03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
associate degrees you are bringing 60
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
credits or more so so on purely just the
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
credit count level student would have
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
junior standing if the programs line up
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
it would be perhaps junior standing in
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
the program they're pursuing if a
 
03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
student was a liberal arts in the first
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
two years associate of arts degree
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
but wants to be in engineering may still
 
03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
need additional prerequisites in math or
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
or physics or or chemistry before
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility so again there may be some
 
03:43:05.590 --> 03:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
some instances where
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
as president lloyd said it depends
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
but but the junior standing would almost
 
03:43:11.670 --> 03:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
be the easiest part that they'd have
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
junior standing even if they still had
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
additional prerequisites
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
to be in junior level classes for a
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
different program than they had started
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.750 --> 03:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
and to be clear and i hope i hope we um
 
03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
effectively communicated that this last
 
03:43:30.319 --> 03:43:31.750 align:start position:0%
effectively communicated that this last
week

03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
the university system is committed to
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
ensuring there's affordable
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
quality access
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
to higher education
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
from the community college system
 
03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not going to say though today
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
that the university system is going to
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
support this language as is i just don't
 
03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
know enough and i'm not i need to go
 
03:43:53.590 --> 03:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
back and talk to
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
others at the institutions again because
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're just seeing this i don't know that
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to come out and say
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely every associate's
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
degree of science and arts at the
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
community college system is going to
 
03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
transfer everyone in as a junior
 
03:44:13.349 --> 03:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
maybe but i i need to do a little more
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
homework on it before i can oppose or
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh care to respond to that
 
03:44:29.110 --> 03:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
mr one more time sure i i want to just
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
say that i think representative tanner
 
03:44:33.269 --> 03:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
is on to something and i i share her
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
concern uh strictly with the word junior
 
03:44:37.510 --> 03:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
because junior
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
if that's in statute that implies that
 
03:44:42.150 --> 03:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
someone who's a junior has two years to
 
03:44:42.160 --> 03:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
someone who's a junior has two years to
go

03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
so if someone
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
does not have the right credits to to
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
match up to a program in the university
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
system um
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
i think the transfer thing is fine but
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
to to strict to come right out in
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
statute and say they'll be considered a
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
junior that
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
03:45:08.710 --> 03:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative tanner had a question
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
first no okay excuse me
 
03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thanks all
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
03:45:15.359 --> 03:45:17.030 align:start position:0%
very much um
so

03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:19.269 --> 03:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you know along along this
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
is i mean i
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
mean shannon will remember this too
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
going back
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
what was it 20 years or something like
 
03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
that when we were essentially doing the
 
03:45:30.150 --> 03:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh with the engineering technology
 
03:45:35.189 --> 03:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
programs at nhti and uh wanting students
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to seamlessly
 
03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
enter their junior year at
 
03:45:40.160 --> 03:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
enter their junior year at
unh

03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
unh
 
03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
and um and it was a it was a tremendous
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:50.309 --> 03:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
in a program that where both the
 
03:45:52.150 --> 03:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
community college had the program and
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
the university system had the had the
 
03:45:55.040 --> 03:45:56.469 align:start position:0%
the university system had the had the
program

03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:45:58.150 --> 03:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact the program worked really
 
03:46:00.150 --> 03:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
well on a two plus two basis where you
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
did your first two years at nhti and did
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
the remaining two years
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
at uh at unh but it still wasn't
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly seamless
 
03:46:12.389 --> 03:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
at um at that point i think it it did
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
sort of come down to
 
03:46:14.399 --> 03:46:15.110 align:start position:0%
sort of come down to
to

03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know concerns over you know
 
03:46:19.590 --> 03:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
credits that would transfer and things i
 
03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
know we've come a long way in in the
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
last 20 years uh for sure but uh
 
03:46:27.269 --> 03:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
but uh but i think those those concerns
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
are valid um and there must be other
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
challenges too i mean you know what
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
about uh you know somebody that may be
 
03:46:38.550 --> 03:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they were and i i don't
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
know where nhgi is in the in the
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
community college um interscholastic um
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh or intercollegiate um you know
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
athletics but for students that may want
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
to continue with with sports
 
03:46:56.309 --> 03:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh at one of our university uh colleges
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they want to come in as a
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
sophomore and be able to be you know
 
03:47:03.189 --> 03:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
three years eligible
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know would this affect um
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility or any other sort of um
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:47:11.520 --> 03:47:12.790 align:start position:0%
you know
tangential

03:47:12.790 --> 03:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
tangential
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't say tangential i mean
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's financial aid or or you
 
03:47:18.389 --> 03:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
know other
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
things that are that um
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know are sort of part and parcel to
 
03:47:25.269 --> 03:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
being a student at the in the university
 
03:47:25.279 --> 03:47:29.110 align:start position:0%
being a student at the in the university
system

03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't propose to speak i presume
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
to speak for anybody other than the
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
community college system but i'm i'm
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
reading from the unh catalog
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
and it reads baccalaureate and
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
associated arts undergraduates are
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
assigned class standing on the basis of
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
semester credits of academic work
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
completed with a passing grade as
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
follows to be a sophomore 26 credits to
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
be a junior 58 credits to be a senior 90
 
03:47:54.880 --> 03:47:55.830 align:start position:0%
be a junior 58 credits to be a senior 90
credits

03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
credits
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
so the concept of junior standing is
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a normal thing independent of
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
how well you did if you got d's in all
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the courses that you took
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
so that your gpa was not a 2-0 you were
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
not going to be online to graduate but
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
you'd accumulated 60 credits
 
03:48:15.030 --> 03:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
by the definition in the catalog you're
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
still you still have junior standing it
 
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
also has relevance as representative
 
03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
luna was touching on for satisfactory
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
academic progress for federal financial
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
aid so the concept of being a junior
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
based on the credit work completed is
 
03:48:31.750 --> 03:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
pretty broadly established in both
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
institutional administration but also
 
03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
federal financial aid administration i
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it necessarily assures a
 
03:48:40.150 --> 03:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
student that they've only got two years
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
to the finish line and ask the parent of
 
03:48:44.950 --> 03:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
any student who's been a super senior in
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
college they will understand that
 
03:48:49.349 --> 03:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
concept that that the finish line can
 
03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
move if the student's academic work in
 
03:48:54.150 --> 03:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
required courses doesn't bring them to
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
i confess i immediately began thinking
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
oh my god we're going to have to deal
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
with red shirting in this issue too
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
i was taken back a little bit but then i
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
recovered as the chancellor spoke
 
03:49:12.319 --> 03:49:28.469 align:start position:0%
recovered as the chancellor spoke
anyone

03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's my finger
 
03:49:29.760 --> 03:49:30.870 align:start position:0%
it's my finger
okay

03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
glenn's only half trained me i'm part of
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
a human service
 
03:49:36.790 --> 03:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
experiment you realize and i'm only part
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
of the way through my training training
 
03:49:38.560 --> 03:49:39.590 align:start position:0%
of the way through my training training
so

03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:39.600 --> 03:49:40.469 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:42.309 --> 03:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'll get there
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
but at any rate uh when we were chatting
 
03:49:46.389 --> 03:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
before about where to go
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
after today and what maybe should be
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
done and what i would suggest and then
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's inviting everybody to say yay or
 
03:49:53.680 --> 03:49:54.550 align:start position:0%
that's inviting everybody to say yay or
nay

03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
nay
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh is at this point we
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
asked the chancellor to
 
03:50:02.469 --> 03:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
get the institutions and also the
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
university is appropriate and see if we
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
can arrive at those kinds of definitions
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we've just been spelling out here
 
03:50:12.070 --> 03:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
about number of hours and put that down
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
and avoid terms like junior status even
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
though it may have one meaning to one
 
03:50:19.110 --> 03:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
person it may have another to someone
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
else and just use the numbers
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
and that way we're not dancing around
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
that but the concept is
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
that if you've gotten all your credits
 
03:50:31.030 --> 03:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
up to a certain level then you become
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
whatever that university says you are
 
03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
i will caution you that this has can go
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
the other way too
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
i transferred from geology which
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
required five credits of integral and
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
differential math and finite mathematics
 
03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
to english which only required three
 
03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
but i got all five credits toward my
 
03:50:54.239 --> 03:50:55.830 align:start position:0%
but i got all five credits toward my
diploma

03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
diploma
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
just the last two were free electives
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
on that so it it happens
 
03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
moving around in any
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
set of programs
 
03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
the one concept that i would say that we
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to honor without fail
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
is the requirement for prerequisites you
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
cannot put a professor in the position
 
03:51:17.590 --> 03:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
of trying to seat someone who is not
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
prepared for the course
 
03:51:21.750 --> 03:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we all understand that but
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
it may
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
be required or need to be put inside the
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
agreement because the professor expects
 
03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
certain or
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
requirements to have been met prior to
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment if the receiving university
 
03:51:37.590 --> 03:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
says that course doesn't require it then
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
you may have to take an additional
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
course that's just what happens when you
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
transfer among
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
programs but we'll have to spell it out
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
in this because it will be that kind of
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
a binding agreement
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else with concerns issues further
 
03:51:53.920 --> 03:51:56.150 align:start position:0%
anyone else with concerns issues further
subjects

03:51:56.150 --> 03:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
not seeing any um yes
 
03:52:02.950 --> 03:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
i stand correct sorry
 
03:52:05.189 --> 03:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
i would hope we still
 
03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass like this
 
03:52:11.030 --> 03:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
we still really need to guide our
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
students to the transfer pathways
 
03:52:16.150 --> 03:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
so they don't
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
think they're going to get to one of our
 
03:52:18.399 --> 03:52:19.429 align:start position:0%
think they're going to get to one of our
four-year

03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
schools as a junior
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then find out
 
03:52:26.630 --> 03:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
they have to take a whole different set
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
of courses and extend their degree out
 
03:52:30.710 --> 03:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
another two years
 
03:52:34.150 --> 03:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
as opposed to where i started with
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
getting students into transfer pathways
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
where they know and there are lots of
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
pathways you take these courses here
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
and they're all going to transfer into
 
03:52:45.510 --> 03:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
your major
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:54.150 --> 03:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
i agree very much that we need to do it
 
03:52:55.590 --> 03:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
probably going to occur naturally as the
 
03:52:58.000 --> 03:52:59.429 align:start position:0%
probably going to occur naturally as the
pathway

03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
development idea continues i mean it'll
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
start to spell out but i think a clear
 
03:53:08.309 --> 03:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
explanation of what's a required course
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
what will be an elective course what you
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
may have done here in your major may
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
only be an elective toward another
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
degree i was required to take an extra
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
year of french
 
03:53:20.469 --> 03:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
you know and i wasn't thinking of it but
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.990 --> 03:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
several years ago when i had the
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
occasion to work with sarah jane steen
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
up at to a psu prior to don coming on
 
03:53:32.479 --> 03:53:33.349 align:start position:0%
up at to a psu prior to don coming on
board

03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
we had a discussion how many years does
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
it take somebody to get a four-year
 
03:53:37.279 --> 03:53:38.469 align:start position:0%
it take somebody to get a four-year
degree

03:53:38.469 --> 03:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh at the university system and when we
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
looked at throughout the country
 
03:53:45.429 --> 03:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
the figures which were oftentimes used
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
were six years it would take about six
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
years for a person to get a degree
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know what it is for unh or keene
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
or plymouth now
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
however it varies tremendously depending
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
upon a lot of personal circumstances of
 
03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
the student
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
availability of courses
 
03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:04.389 align:start position:0%
availability of courses
finances

03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
finances
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
ability to pay all those things stack up
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
i just think it's would be very helpful
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
that students know that by going to a
 
03:54:16.150 --> 03:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
two-year school i can go on there and
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
enter into a four-year school
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
as a junior
 
03:54:22.309 --> 03:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
i i think that what we're trying to do
 
03:54:22.319 --> 03:54:23.670 align:start position:0%
i i think that what we're trying to do
is

03:54:23.670 --> 03:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know we silo a lot of our
 
03:54:28.229 --> 03:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
education for one we do it at the
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
the k-12 levels as well
 
03:54:32.790 --> 03:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
we we tend to have a lot of ownership on
 
03:54:32.800 --> 03:54:33.510 align:start position:0%
we we tend to have a lot of ownership on
it

03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
and we tend to get away from what is it
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
that you need to know to be a good
 
03:54:40.150 --> 03:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
graduate of a four-year school or a
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
two-year school depending upon what your
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
degree is in
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when we miss out on those
 
03:54:48.150 --> 03:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
competencies the ability to do it's
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
always what's on paper you took this
 
03:54:51.830 --> 03:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
this and this
 
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
right now i can very barely tell you
 
03:54:56.790 --> 03:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
what i took when i was in orono or when
 
03:54:58.469 --> 03:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
i was going to get my master's or when i
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
went on to get the 30 hours on top of
 
03:55:00.239 --> 03:55:01.349 align:start position:0%
went on to get the 30 hours on top of
that

03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you what i've learned
 
03:55:05.830 --> 03:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
through doing with my degree as a result
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
of my degree
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm uh
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
i would i would say i'd speak on behalf
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the student and the families are
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
trying to get kids through here and i
 
03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
think this is also a good way of
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
retaining kids in our own state knowing
 
03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:20.790 align:start position:0%
retaining kids in our own state knowing
that

03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
i can go where the school is close to me
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
right now one of seven community
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
colleges which are regionally local
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
schools we got to maintain
 
03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
but the students have to know that this
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
state supports them and going to that
 
03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
next step
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
and when we start saying you can't go
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
because you you're missing out on this
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
or that
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
i think we're missing the purpose what
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
education is all about
 
03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'd encourage us to really think
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
about trying to figure out how we're
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to do this the next step is we've
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
got to get all these
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
these courses throughout all these
 
03:55:55.510 --> 03:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
schools stackable
 
03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
so that we know how they relate to each
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
other and so they can transfer between
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
keene and plymouth state or plymouth
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
state and unh just on that level alone
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
and and so we have a long way to go here
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i see this as a step to start
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
pushing us in that direction
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to see
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
that this is a consideration that's
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
being done on the on the
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
college community college level and at
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
the university level we've done the two
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
plus two we've done the three plus one
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
we've done all this stuff it's time now
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair would anyone else
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
care to address that particular
 
03:56:40.479 --> 03:56:41.990 align:start position:0%
care to address that particular
conversation

03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
well invitation yes uh i guess
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
it puts us in the position now of having
 
03:56:50.550 --> 03:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
to go to those of you who are
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
representing the university and the
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
03:56:54.800 --> 03:56:56.389 align:start position:0%
community colleges
to

03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
take this back to campus perhaps mullet
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
maybe we won't we meet next week but we
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
meet the week after that is two weeks
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
enough time for you to have some
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
conversation this committee's only set
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
up for one more meeting oh really can it
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
well we're going to be getting into time
 
03:57:18.309 --> 03:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
and we're starting to
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
close in on the governor's presentation
 
03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
which i believe will probably be on the
 
03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:24.309 align:start position:0%
which i believe will probably be on the
16th

03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
16th
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
and session which we may be following
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
that they're not in granite they haven't
 
03:57:30.150 --> 03:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
been put in place yet but we're coming
 
03:57:31.349 --> 03:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
up on a lot
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
going on there
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
and this bill is going to have to be out
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
of here by
 
03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
the middle week in march
 
03:57:43.349 --> 03:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
so there's not a whole lot of time here
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
with everything else we have going on
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
can i just jump in and i'll defer some
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the wordsmithing in conversations you
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
know to to the collective group but i
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
just want to go back to something uh
 
03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative luno said and that he
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
said oh shane you know 20 years ago we
 
03:58:27.269 --> 03:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
were working on this i think we shall
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
just take a pause and say we've been
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
working on this for 20 years i mean i've
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
been in the community college system for
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
19 now and we're having some of the same
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
discussion so i'm just i'm excited about
 
03:58:37.990 --> 03:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
this i personally went through this as
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know with my my keen state
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
and nhti relationship and anything i can
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
do to to help whether it's wordsmithing
 
03:58:46.150 --> 03:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the junior status
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
piece we may have to talk about that but
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know i think i'm excited and on
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of the students representative as
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned through the student lens
 
03:58:55.990 --> 03:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
of from 20 years ago to where we are now
 
03:58:57.670 --> 03:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm excited to see this conversation
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
come back around and really you know
 
03:59:01.349 --> 03:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
move the state forward so i just wanted
 
03:59:05.429 --> 03:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'll only add the
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
work ahead
 
03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think that chief administrative
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
officer preventure probably has the
 
03:59:15.590 --> 03:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
heavier lift on the university side
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
because they're the receiving
 
03:59:17.120 --> 03:59:18.710 align:start position:0%
because they're the receiving
institutions

03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
but i i want to clarify that we have a
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
lot of pathways already in place we've
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
built a lot of articulation agreements
 
03:59:28.229 --> 03:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
they align with specific first two years
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
mapping to the last two years so a lot
 
03:59:31.750 --> 03:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
of that's been done
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether or not the language
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
has proposed would open that up to
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
anything more than that second clause
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
says which is that you still need to
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
satisfy the admission requirements you
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
still need to have the applicability so
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not as concerned about whether this
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
efficiently or appropriately but i would
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
defer to
 
03:59:55.830 --> 03:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
cao proventure for the university system
 
03:59:57.750 --> 03:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
side of this because they would they
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
would have to address the the receiving
 
04:00:00.160 --> 04:00:02.469 align:start position:0%
would have to address the the receiving
end

04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned i don't i don't have
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
an answer to that today so if you need
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
an answer in a week then
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
all right i presume
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
given the constraints we're under
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
we would
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
be obliged to ask you to come back in a
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
week and at least with the parameters of
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
what you could uh
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
commit to
 
04:00:31.670 --> 04:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know and without trying to put
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
you in a box in any way uh just to do
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we would anticipate coming back and
 
04:00:37.520 --> 04:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
that we would anticipate coming back and
hearing

04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:00:40.870 --> 04:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's possible and what's planned and
 
04:00:43.590 --> 04:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
if in fact it is useful for us
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
to take any step at this point or have
 
04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
we done at least the shove and we can
 
04:00:50.070 --> 04:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
ask you to come back in
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
sometime in the near future and tell us
 
04:00:55.590 --> 04:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
what the pathways are are looking like
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
i suppose the best way to anyone else
 
04:00:57.840 --> 04:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
i suppose the best way to anyone else
with

04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
questions input
 
04:01:00.720 --> 04:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
questions input
whatever

04:01:01.990 --> 04:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously everybody in this room
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
has had some experience with this
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
it comes out in our stories and we all
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
have a legitimate
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
personal interest
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
as well and we know what a difference it
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
can make
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
my goal in calling for this was to
 
04:01:20.150 --> 04:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
initiate this discussion and to open it
 
04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
up so we could move forward and not stay
 
04:01:22.160 --> 04:01:23.110 align:start position:0%
up so we could move forward and not stay
stuck

04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
stuck
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
20 years ago or wherever it was
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
to see the response and to note the
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
concerns because i think now we can
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
begin to address them and put them
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
behind us
 
04:01:35.279 --> 04:01:36.630 align:start position:0%
behind us
so

04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:39.110 --> 04:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
see you in a week
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.840 --> 04:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:04:05.830 --> 04:04:05.840 align:start position:0%

you

04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.840 --> 04:08:45.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.840 --> 04:17:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
