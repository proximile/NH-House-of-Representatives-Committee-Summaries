00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 align:start position:0%
and again I say good morning everyone
 
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's one of the hardest things of the
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
job of testifying is Turn on
 
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
it gives you a clue you get a little red
 
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
light so we will be kind and gracious
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
because we haven't mastered it either
 
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.990 align:start position:0%

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
my name is Richard head I'm the
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
government Affairs coordinator for the
 
00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I'm joined today by
 
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
judge Ashley who is the Deputy
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
Administrator of the circuit court and
 
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
judge Garner who also sits in the
 
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
just very briefly I'm going to have
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
everyone introduce themselves to you
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'll take 30 seconds because you really
 
00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 align:start position:0%
don't want to hear from me today you're
 
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 align:start position:0%
going to see me the most over the course
 
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
of this session but for today when we
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
turn it over to the judges judge Ashley
 
00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
will give a sort of overview of the
 
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
circuit court and judge Garner will
 
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
really focus on Family Division but
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
first we're just going to introduce
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
introductions and I'll address you for
 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
good morning folks my name is Susan
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
Ashley and I'm the deputy administrative
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
judge for the circuit court judge king
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
was not able to be here today he's our
 
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
administrative judge so you likely are
 
00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
more familiar with him I have the
 
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity as Deputy administrative
 
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
judge to do some of this administrative
 
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
type work but also I do still get to sit
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
in court as a presiding judge down in
 
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
usually Rochester sometimes I sub in
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but that's really where I I
 
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
hail from and so it's good to see all of
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
you today and I'll talk with you very
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
briefly after Richard does
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Michael Garner I'm a
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
circuit court judge
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
um and I sit in Laconia virtually
 
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
exclusively in the fourth circuit court
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
and I'll be talking mostly about Family
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
Division but as a circuit court judge I
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
hear all sorts of cases that come before
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
us and I'll be happy to answer whatever
 
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
questions any of you may have as I go
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
along thanks
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
and on that point we do encourage anyone
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
who has any questions you have two
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
judges who are here to answer any and
 
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
all questions that you may have just
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
very brief excuse me just just a
 
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
reminder to the folks here because we
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
have a lot of brand new reps uh you may
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
ask questions but I'm the gatekeeper so
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
put your hand up and because people
 
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes down the Far Corners are just
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
a bit out of my sight line it is
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate for people to to do that so
 
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
I can see a hand that is up yes fair
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
point Thank you Mr chairman
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize I won't be able to
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
see to the right that well
 
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.969 align:start position:0%
see to the right that well
um

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
so very briefly you know there are two
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
trial courts in in the state of New
 
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have the Superior Court
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
we're not going to focus on Superior
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
Court today
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
um but we also have the Circuit Court
 
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
um in I think it was 2012. uh
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
Consolidated what used to be family
 
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
court probate court and District Court
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
it made them divisions of the circuit
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
court so we now have the circuit court
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
so we no longer have a family court we
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
have family division of the circuit
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
court and the judges in Circuit Court
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
can sit in any of the divisions and in
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
any particular day maybe sitting in all
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the divisions the the cases are all
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
um coming before them there tends to be
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
a a schedule within the course of a week
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
as to the type of cases so there may be
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
a day where you're going to hear
 
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
criminal cases there may be a day where
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
you're more likely to have the family
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
Docket in front of you
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
um but the Circuit Court judges can be
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
sitting in any of the divisions and with
 
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
that I'm just going to talk turn it over
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
to judge Ashley have her talk about
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court those divisions really
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
what it would have uh what it contains
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Richard so
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
um as Richard indicated under Circuit
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
Court there are the three divisions and
 
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
so you'll still see and hear a lot of
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
folks say I got to go down to District
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
Court right so District Court of course
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
pre-circuit Court there were Standalone
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
buildings that was the Local District
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
Court building when Family Division was
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
developed Family Division by and large
 
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions shared space in the
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
district court building so there was the
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
district Division and the Family
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
Division together then when Circuit
 
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 align:start position:0%
Court came along and pulled in a probate
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
as well then we have the three divisions
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
and those courts are scattered
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as Richard said our
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
judges do sit on all of these case types
 
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
or can be assigned to sit on all of
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
these case types and often are doing
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
that within the course of one day
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
probate of course is our smallest case
 
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
numbers but have some significant cases
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
particularly our trust cases but they
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
have the trusts in States guardianship
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
over in facetated individuals Equity
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
matters those types of cases then we
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
have our district division which is
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
probably most familiar to a lot of folks
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
because it has a small level criminal
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
cases also our small claims cases in in
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
civil cases of a certain lower Financial
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
value we do landlord-tenant cases in our
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
district division as well so those are
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
the primary matters that we're handling
 
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:41.180 align:start position:0%
in the district division is very busy
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of folks coming in and
 
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:45.740 align:start position:0%
out of the courthouse for those matters
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
then we have Family Division and
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
obviously this committee is going to be
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
focused by and large on family cases
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
some folks automatically go to divorce
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
parenting which is what judge Garner is
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
going to likely spend a lot of time
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
talking with you about today but family
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
division is not just divorces in child
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
support and parenting cases there is the
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
large spectrum of all things family that
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
are in Family Division so that includes
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
our juvenile case abuse which includes
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases delinquency
 
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.690 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases delinquency
matters

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Chin's cases children in need of
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
services those are all what we often
 
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
refer to as our juvenile cases there are
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
cases that come off of those sometimes
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
like termination of parental rights
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
we have our adoption cases also in
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
Family Division so those are all Family
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
Division case types we also handle
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
guardianship over minors so we have many
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
guardianship over minor cases and then
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
we have our domestic violence petitions
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
again those are the Civil petitions not
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
criminal charges that relate to domestic
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
violence those would be in District
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
division but our standard domestic
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
violence petition one person asking for
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
a protective order against another
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
person those are also handled in Family
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
Division so all of those things come to
 
00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
us on a daily basis there are
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
emergencies involved in almost every one
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
of those Family Division case types and
 
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
so we need to be prepared to respond to
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
those on a daily basis in high high
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
volume but of course we also handle
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
divorce parenting child support and so
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to turn I'm going to turn it
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
over to judge Garner today to address
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
you on those matters but I'm happy to
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
on any of those divisions or anything in
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
particular in Family Division itself
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
just to put the the the
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
little context or scope in terms of the
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
numbers when we're talking
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
um Circuit Court you have about 125 new
 
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
125 000 new cases every year
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
um of those about 64 65 000 are criminal
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
um in the just domestic uh you have
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
about ten thousand
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
um and domestic violence around 4 500.
 
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
so just to put a little scope and
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
context in terms of of what is sort of
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
flowing through that court system thank
 
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.090 align:start position:0%
flowing through that court system thank
you

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
morning again thank you thank you for
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
I ordinarily sit in the Laconia Circuit
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
Court that's the fourth circuit court
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm there as a full-time judge I'm
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
the presiding judge there
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
um I would like to invite questions as
 
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
we go along the time available this
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
morning really won't give me an adequate
 
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to touch on every facet of
 
00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court even every facet of
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
the Family Division but I think it's
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
more important for me to be a resource
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
to answer questions that you may have so
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
that so that you can have more of an
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
informed sense of what we do in the
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
court so feel free to ask
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
if you forget to ask a question and it
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
occurs to you later on
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
um have someone let Richard know and
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
send him an email and I'll be happy to
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
try to respond the only limitations on
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
answering questions are that
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
um please don't ask me about a case
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
that's pending somewhere whether you use
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
the name or not and I'll be grateful if
 
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
you don't ask me to weigh in on
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
particular proposed bills that are going
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
to be in front of your committee our
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch has a way of addressing
 
00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
those but that wouldn't be up that
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
decision wouldn't be up to somebody like
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
me and so I'm just going to defer to
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
them for that
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'm as a circuit court judge I'm
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
cross-trained in all three of the
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
divisions family district and probate
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
we have four courtrooms in Laconia and
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
there are three other judges who sit
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
there part-time
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
each of them with one exception the one
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
who does just probate each of them does
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
all of the things that any of us do
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
I also have a Judicial referee that we
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
work with that's a retired judge who's
 
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
over 70 who
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
sits part-time in Laconia doing
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
primarily juvenile cases but can do some
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
other cases as well and I have a child
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
support referee one of only two or three
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
in the state who does exclusively child
 
00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
in the state who does exclusively child
support

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
and also sits there part-time we share
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
him with Manchester a couple of days a
 
00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.550 align:start position:0%
him with Manchester a couple of days a
week

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
let me just supplement Richard's
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
description of the numbers involved by
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
letting you know the new case filings
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
that we had in the Laconia Family
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
Division last year based on my um
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
my inexpert review of the docket numbers
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
we had domestic relations cases about
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
385 new filings last year and by
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
Domestic Relations I mean divorce
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
parenting and those cases that are
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
exclusively child support typically
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
brought by the division
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
we had roughly half that number of cases
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
that are brought forward and these are
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
cases where there had been in the past a
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
final order
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
and the parties for whatever reason are
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
bringing the case forward to modify that
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
vital order in some way so we had
 
00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:13.459 align:start position:0%
typically about half of the new filings
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
in addition to those are brought forward
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
cases in domestic violence cases we had
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
about 254 domestic violence petitions
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
filed last year in juvenile cases as
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
judge Ashley mentioned these are abuse
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases chins delinquency tpr
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
adoption cases we had 180 of those in
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
minor guardianship cases we had 85. and
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
so totaling that up we're looking at a
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
rough number of about a thousand cases
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
and Laconia Family Division filed last
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
year and I think that's basically an
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
accurate number in terms of the number
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
of active cases we have at any point in
 
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
time probably a thousand it goes up or
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
down obviously but that's the rough
 
00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:59.210 align:start position:0%
down obviously but that's the rough
number

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
in Family Division because I'm the
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
presiding judge and I'm there full-time
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
I'm responsible for something like 55 or
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
60 percent of those cases and that's
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
just how it falls out the part-time
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
judges come in and they get assigned
 
00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:14.230 align:start position:0%
judges come in and they get assigned
cases

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
and manage their dockets which are
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
similar to my dockets
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
I have three basic duties in what I do
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
my first Duty as a judge is to conduct
 
00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
hearings to hear cases and to generate
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
orders from those hearings
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
I think you may have a copy of
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
um recent doctors do they have those
 
00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:41.579 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a copy of three days
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
of recent dockets I think that's Monday
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
through Wednesday of last week
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
that'll give you a sense of what we do
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis two one of those days
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
is a full day final hearing two of them
 
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
were typical list days with a variety of
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
different cases all within Family
 
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.530 align:start position:0%
different cases all within Family
Division

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
Division
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
the second thing that I do as a
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
presiding judge is to field emergency
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
motions that get filed every day and
 
00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
these would typically be in domestic
 
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:11.300 align:start position:0%
violence cases
 
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
for example if if the litigant gets an
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
emergency protective order from the
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
police the night before then that
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
litigant can come to court the next day
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the emergency order stays in place until
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
4 pm and they can come to court and file
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence petition
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are also emergency motions that
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
are filed in parenting or divorce cases
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
really in any of the cases possibly but
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
those are the cases that come up most
 
00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:37.790 align:start position:0%
those are the cases that come up most
often

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
and the presiding judge's job is to
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
review those filings when they're made
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
to determine whether there needs to be a
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
hearing immediately that day on on that
 
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.730 align:start position:0%
hearing immediately that day on on that
motion

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
to confirm that when it's required
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's been notice to the other side
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they have some opportunity to come
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
in and file an objection or a response
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
and to issue an order by the end of the
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
work day about those motions we never
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
know from day to day how many of those
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
motions they're going to be typically
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
Mondays are busy and typically Friday
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
afternoons are busy beyond that there's
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
always a certain number
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
um and so part of my job is to field
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
those motions and take the appropriate
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
steps to issue orders if necessary
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
the last part of my job that's sort of a
 
00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299 align:start position:0%
core function is to sign documents that
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office has put together that
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
are typically motions that are filed by
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
one side and then objections or
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
responses filed by the other side
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
there's the rule is 10 days to file an
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
objection or a response so the clerk
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
will get a motion they'll wait to 10
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
days and if an objection or response
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
comes in then those are put into the
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
file and the file is left for me to
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
review and sign those
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
and typically that's a significant part
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
of my work week I am lucky enough to
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
have two referees at the court where I
 
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
work a Judicial referee and a child
 
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
support referee
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
and each of their orders must be counter
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
signed by a judge who reviews the order
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they've applied the
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
correct legal standards so that sort of
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
adds to my pile of motions at any given
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
moment that I have to look at and sign
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
aside from motions that are called
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
expedited motions I get to those motions
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
as I can
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
so those are my three core functions as
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
a judge as a circuit court judge I also
 
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
like all of my colleagues I'm available
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
to take emergency uh
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
emergencies that come up and that are
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
that need a Judicial order that happen
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
after hours so typically those who are
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
domestic violence emergency orders where
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
the police call up and say we'd like to
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
get an emergency protective order for
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
this person which good till the next day
 
00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
if it's granted and sometimes those are
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
motions that are brought before me with
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
by dcyf who needs an emergency placement
 
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
for a child who may be removed from the
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
parents care for that for that moment
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
where all all of us are typically always
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
on call for those sorts of things
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
let me give you a sense of what my
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
typical day is like if that's helpful
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
the court is open at eight o'clock in
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
the morning and we stay open until four
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
typically my hearing start at 8 30. and
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
so the time that I have to spend between
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
when I get to court and that first 8 30
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
hearing is typically spent looking at
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
the signing cart for emotions that may
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
be necessary for the clerk to have and
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
get to work on earlier in the day
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
looking at my files I'll pick up a stack
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
of files from the clerk's office and
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
take them upstairs to Chambers and I
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
begin to look at them
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
in the order in which they're going to
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
be heard so that I can reacquaint myself
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
with files that I have a certain level
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
of knowledge about and so I can learn
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
about files that I've never seen before
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I'll typically look at whatever the
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
current pleading is if it's emotions
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
hearing I'll look at the motion the
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
objection I'll try to get some sense of
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
the background and because I typically
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
do most of my own orders I'll create a
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
caption on my laptop that will allow me
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
later on to create an order once I've
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
done that hearing
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
I'll also check because the Belknap
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
County House of Corrections will is
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
available to us for video arraignments
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock every morning I'll check
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
to see if anyone's in custody and needs
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
to be arraigned typically the judge is
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
doing criminal docket will do that
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
arraignment at 10 o'clock in the morning
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
but sometimes we I don't have another
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
judge there and so it'll be up to me to
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
find a space within my family division
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
docket to go downstairs and do that
 
00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:53.630 align:start position:0%
docket to go downstairs and do that
arraignment

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
our hearings are typically scheduled for
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
30 minutes and almost every sort of
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
hearing is typically scheduled for 30
 
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.450 align:start position:0%
hearing is typically scheduled for 30
minutes

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
and my aim in that time is to get the
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
hearing done
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
and if the hearing doesn't take the
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
whole 30 minutes my aim is to get
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
started on writing the order
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
some hearings will take more than 30
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
minutes that's inevitable although the
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
parties are told when they get the
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
notice that the hearing is being
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 30 minutes or if it's for
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
longer for an hour or two hours or
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
whatever they know that in advance but
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a complicated case with
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
several different different issues and
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes if you have attorneys the
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
cases are going to run over the 30
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
minutes and it's my job to manage that
 
00:21:42.049 --> 00:21:42.059 align:start position:0%
docket so that at the end of the day
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'll be able to have conducted all of
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
the hearings within the time allotted
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
so sometimes that leaves me time to
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
write the orders and sometimes it
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't and it's the unusual day when I
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
get all of my orders done by the time
 
00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
the last hearing is done more typically
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'm working on orders after hours to get
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
as many of the orders done as I can and
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
obviously triaging orders that can be
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
done quickly orders that are expedited
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
that have an urgent need and taking a
 
00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
little more time and setting aside
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
orders that may be final orders after
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
contested final hearings so that I have
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
a chance to digest what I've heard to
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
look at exhibits if there are exhibits
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
and to sort of recreate the testimony in
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
my head so that I can make those
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
and the emergencies and the other things
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
just sort of fill in the gaps so if I
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
have a break for some reason in the
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
middle of the day that's unexpected I'll
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
check with the clerk to see what I can
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
do and if nothing else there's always
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
there are always files downstairs for me
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
to look at and sign
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
on difficult cases or final hearings
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
that may be a full day sometimes
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
multi-day final hearings typically
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
involve exhibits they'll typically
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
involve testimony of multiple Witnesses
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
I take notes on my laptop in the
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
courtroom that's just a personal
 
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
idiosyncrasy of mine and folks get used
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
to the noise after a while but it really
 
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:11.900 align:start position:0%
helps me
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
recreate what I've heard and work with
 
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:16.820 align:start position:0%
what I've heard so that if I do a
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
contested final hearing when I get to
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
writing the case I'll reprint my notes
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
and read them and I'll look at the
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
exhibits and that way I have a fresher
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
flavor if it's been a couple of weeks
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
before I get started working on the case
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
I'll be able to recreate it to work on
 
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:34.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
writing time is precious for any circuit
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
court judge who works in the Family
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
Division there is not really enough
 
00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:44.179 align:start position:0%
writing time
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm typically behind and I say that
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
knowing the judge Ashley who's in charge
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
of keeping track of that sort of thing
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
is sitting here
 
00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.169 align:start position:0%
is sitting here
um

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.049 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
I've always felt as though
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
doing an order that's the best order you
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
can do makes it worth the time and so I
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
don't sacrifice quality for time when I
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
write my orders
 
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.049 align:start position:0%
write my orders
um

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
contested final hearings particularly in
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
cases in cases that involve children are
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
difficult even if there are attorneys
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
involved they're difficult for the
 
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
involved they're difficult for the
litigants

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
litigants
 
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
there is a there's an intrusiveness
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's inherent in the court system
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
people don't like someone else making
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
decisions about their children's lives
 
00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
of course why would you why would anyone
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
the system though is designed ultimately
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
to allow that to happen and require it
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
to happen when a decision has to be made
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
and the parties haven't been able to
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
reach decisions on their own but I want
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that in Family Division we
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
provide multiple opportunities for
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
parties to work together and to try to
 
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
create agreements on their own
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
particularly agreements that relate to
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
so we have a first appearance process
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
which is basically a lecture given by it
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
used to be a live judge before covet and
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
now it's on video
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
that is given to folks who are in a
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
divorce with children or parenting cases
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
and they come to court or nowadays they
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
go online from home and they watch the
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
video and the video is basically a
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
description of the process
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
a description of the mediation part of
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
the process and an encouragement for the
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
parties to try to work out as many
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
agreements together as they can to take
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of mediation if they can do it
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
mediation is mandatory in in these sorts
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
of cases there are some exceptions if
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's a domestic violence order for
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
example both parties have to agree to
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
mediation and those mediations only take
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
place at the courthouse
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
but by and large folks will go to
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
mediation before they go to their first
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
contested Hearing in a parenting in a
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
case that involves children
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
our mediators are certified by the
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
marital the family
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
mediator board they are vastly
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
experienced the group of mediators that
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
we use in Laconia have been doing it for
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
more than a decade at least they have
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cases that they've done
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
they're really effective and so we
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
provide that off-ramp immediately in the
 
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:38.900 align:start position:0%
process and give the parties as much
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity and as much encouragement as
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
we can to try to reach as many
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
we also have the child IMPACT Program
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
which is another mandatory program it's
 
00:26:53.169 --> 00:26:53.179 align:start position:0%
given by different
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
resource providers in different
 
00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
communities but it's basically a short
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
program to help folks understand
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the impact of divorce or Separation on
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
their children and to help folks develop
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
skills for managing the difficulties
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
that their children are going to
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
experience as part of that process it is
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
mandatory we don't get a lot of feedback
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
about it but the feedback that I've
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
gotten about it is that it can be
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
life-changing for folks who just don't
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
know how to talk to each other about
 
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
parenting issues and who really needs
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
some guidance about how to make that
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
work so we ask that folks do that
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
complete that program within 45 days of
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
the filing that happens sometimes but
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
not always but we remind them of it at
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
every opportunity and we expect that by
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
the time they're getting to a tested
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
hearing they're going to have done the
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
child IMPACT program and they'll have a
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of what that
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
expectation is
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan form itself which I
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
hope you have a chance to look at at
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
some point you should look at that form
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
it's an eight or nine page form and it
 
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:00.260 align:start position:0%
was designed by designed by a committee
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
that took a lot of different points of
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
view into account the language in the
 
00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
form is is generally the committee's
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
language but parents are always
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
encouraged to modify the form or change
 
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
it or not use it or pick language that
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
works for them and for their children
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
but it is a sort of a shorthand way of
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
describing a child's life
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
there's almost everything you can think
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
about that would impact a child's life
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
that has a place in that form we expect
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
if we don't expect parents to really
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
have a good sense of any of the other
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
forms within the Family Division we do
 
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
expect that they become familiar with
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan at least to be able
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
to go through it with each other
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
and if they're not able to reach
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
agreements to be able to present their
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
version of it to the court at a
 
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
contested final hearing
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
it's a critical document
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's intended to be user friendly for
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
folks who may not have much experience
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
with the court system
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
and it can be very valuable for the
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
court in analyzing what's going to be in
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
the children's best interest based in
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
part upon what each parent is proposing
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
happen with them so I would encourage
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
you to have a look at that at that Forum
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's our sort of go-to form in
 
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:19.340 align:start position:0%
terms of parenting
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
may I interrupt you at this point with a
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
couple of requests number one could you
 
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
get that form
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
to us either one copy to my committee
 
00:29:32.889 --> 00:29:32.899 align:start position:0%
assistant or
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
16 copies for each member of the
 
00:29:38.649 --> 00:29:38.659 align:start position:0%
committee and then secondly a question
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
if one or both of the parents refuse to
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
go through one of the programs or work
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
on the document what structures do you
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
have for them certainly the
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
the mediation part of it if
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
if there's a domestic violence order in
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
place both parties have to agree to go
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
to mediation if either of them doesn't
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
want to go to mediation we won't do it
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that's an automatic opt-out we don't
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
inquire about the reasons
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
there are some factors that might be
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
present in some cases which would exempt
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
folks from mediation and
 
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.549 align:start position:0%
folks from mediation and
um

00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go back now about four or
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
five years before pandemic when I was
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
doing the first appearance
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
I would describe those factors to the
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
folks who were in the courtroom if they
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
felt it one of the factors might apply
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
to them then we'd have a brief hearing
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
immediately after the first appearance
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
session they could tell me why they
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to mediation I would
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
consider that and in some cases they
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from going to mediation
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
but the presumption is that they will go
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
if they don't go to mediation then
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
there are some fact there are some
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
consequences that could take place
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
technically it's a court order that you
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
go to mediation they could be found in
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
contempt I've I've never seen that
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
happen because I'm not quite sure what
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
the sanctions would be
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
more likely the mediator would report
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
that they didn't settle the case or one
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
party didn't show up and they'd be put
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
back onto the litigation track which is
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
just what's your next contested hearing
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
one might assume that the party that
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
refuses if it be one of the two it might
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
be taken into account in any judgments
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be shouldn't be I wouldn't
 
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.970 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be shouldn't be I wouldn't
okay

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
partly because what happens in mediation
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
is completely confidential okay we don't
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
learn at all and we're very careful
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
about not learning what people say to
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
each other in mediation or what the
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
mediator might have said to them and
 
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
consistent with that I would never
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
inquire about someone why they didn't go
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
to mediation unless they had expressed
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
say there was a hearing in front of me
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
and they said of course we want to go to
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
mediation we're going to do this then if
 
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
the mediator filed a report saying that
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
this person just didn't participate
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
didn't show up didn't explain why none
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
of that I might have some question for
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
judgments about what will be in the best
 
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
interests of children are not affected
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
by A party's
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
unilateral choice not to participate in
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
mediation it's a separate process it's a
 
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
very successful process
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
but it's not a process that that is
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
going to result in an adverse
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
consequence in terms of your parenting
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
rights if you don't participate thank
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
you representative Bickford with a
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh you've mentioned family law committee
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
we created and we
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
parenting plans was something I brought
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
forward with uh John Cameron how are
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
they working out
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
um would you rather go back to something
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
else do you and do you need new tools to
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
I would say the parenting plan has been
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
a great success oh it's this it's a
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
straightforward form folks can read it
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
they can go through it
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
um it provides options for them it
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
provides ample space for them to write
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
their own orders and it's a document
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
that parents can sit down across a table
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
and work through in a Cooperative way
 
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
even if it's not a Cooperative way the
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
mediators are so familiar with the
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that they can help the
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
parents understand the nuances they can
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
even suggest language that might work
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it's it works because it
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
empowers parents to achieve these
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
agreements for themselves
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
so I would say that's been a great
 
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:54.500 align:start position:0%
success there are
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
there are bits and pieces of language in
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
there that with the benefit of a decade
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
of experience or so we could tweak but I
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any wholesale changes to
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
the parenting plan that's been great and
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
and I would say the same thing of
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
mediation we have a high success rate in
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
mediation we encourage people to do it
 
00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:15.899 align:start position:0%
in fact um
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
part of the package for mediation is
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
that you get five hours
 
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
and some folks are they're almost always
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a two-hour session to
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
begin with and then if they're not
 
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
successful they come back onto the sort
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
of contested hearing track but
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
if you've scheduled a final hearing and
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
sadly we're like most courts I think
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're months out scheduling a final
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearing at least several months out
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
you have that time and the folks can use
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
the rest of their five hours in
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
mediation so you really get at least two
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
shots at it to try to make the mediation
 
00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
part of it work and I think it's been
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
very successful
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh we do have two more questions that I
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
will accept and then we're going on to
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
the next speaker and thank you so much
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have you guys back again
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the clerk
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you your honor
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
um what recourse does an individual have
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
if the other party is in violation of
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the parental plan the parenting
 
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
the uh the parental plan the parenting
plan

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
typically there are two sorts of claims
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
that are made there one is a claim for
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
contempt the parenting plan once the
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
court has approved it is a court order
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the sanctions for contempt can be
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
sort of wide-ranging which could include
 
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.349 align:start position:0%
sort of wide-ranging which could include
um

00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
could include a fine it could include I
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
mean in an extreme case it could include
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
incarceration although I've never had
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
the Opera never had the had to make that
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
decision that's not usually on the table
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
it could um
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
include a limitation on a person's
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
ability to actively engage in certain
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
issues in the case
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
ultimately it could be a part of an
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
order that might take into account the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
question whether there's been
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
um an unwarranted interference with the
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
other party's parenting rights so that's
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
one of the standards under 461a11 by
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
which you can modify an existing final
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
order so if a parent is interfering with
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
the other parent's parenting rights it
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
could be by contempt it could be by not
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
following the parenting plan
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
that might be a basis for modification
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
of those orders again that would require
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
a separate request to modify just in
 
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
terms of the sanctions it's it's
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
basically a fine
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
of potentially incarceration limitation
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
on ability to to participate in the case
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
there could there could be others the
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
court has some discretion in terms of
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
the imposition of certain kinds of
 
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.430 align:start position:0%
the imposition of certain kinds of
sanctions

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
sanctions
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
um and so it might be appropriate in
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
some cases to issue a sanction that's
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
more directly related to a parenting
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
issue but you have to be discreet about
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
it it has to be a one-time thing
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you and final question for this
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
group of people representative Vice
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
chairman long
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you judge
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
very good information
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
um if uh I believe it was four or five
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
terms ago all conflict divorces were
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
handed to a particular judge who did all
 
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.670 align:start position:0%
handed to a particular judge who did all
that

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
it appears that that is not the case
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
anymore high high conflict cases were
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
handed to one particular judge who did
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
all those you mean the complex case
 
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
talking correct certainly
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
um in my memory is that that was Judge
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
Foley at the time correct and it was a
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide program and judge Foley took
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
cases they were vetted to make sure they
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
were high conflict cases but he had a
 
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
docket of them and he was able to focus
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
exclusively on that docket and he was
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
very experienced so he was able to
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
manage those cases in a way that none of
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of us would have the time and
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
in some cases the experience to do
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm aware that in Hillsboro
 
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
um and I'm aware that in Hillsboro
Hillsboro

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay now judge
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
judge the year some of you were on this
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
committee last year but judge Lemire
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
handles our complex docket now and again
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's similar to what judge Garner
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
described it's for the those cases that
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
might need
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine days of trial and
 
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:38.060 align:start position:0%
Incredibly complex and issues or
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult circumstances in
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
a particular case we still have the
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
ability to do that but but not nearly
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
enough so we do have judges in all of
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
our courts handling handling matters
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
that are in Conflict unfortunately great
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you certainly
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much before you go I I
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
know there are other questions and I
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
have one too and mine will not be asked
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
either because we have another speaker
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%

who is the one that should we have an
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate question not about a
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
particular case who do we talk to
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%

10 seconds Mr chairman 10.
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
first don't hesitate with the questions
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm not allowed to answer something I
 
00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.230 align:start position:0%
if I'm not allowed to answer something I
won't

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
won't
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
but second if you have a chance come to
 
00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:04.670 align:start position:0%
but second if you have a chance come to
court

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
come to court and Watch What Happens
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
most of these Domestic Relations cases
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
are public cases the public can come in
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
and watch and listen I think it's the
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
it's the best way to get a handle on
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
what happens in the courtroom and to get
 
00:40:19.079 --> 00:40:20.150 align:start position:0%
what happens in the courtroom and to get
real

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
real
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the spot experience about what these
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
folks are going through and and how
 
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
dramatic these cases can be and how
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
challenging they can be not for us but
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the folks who are involved in the
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%

00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
have oversight over the
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
organizations private or non-profit
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
organizations that contract with State
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
agencies so this allows our oversight
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
over all the residential facilities
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
as well as additional community-based
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
services that are contracted with either
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
dcyf or the Bureau of children's
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
in our daily work we have a multi-tiered
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
focus we do work at the case level so we
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
will get complaints that come into our
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
office in regards to children involved
 
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
in the juvenile justice system receiving
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
those community-based services or
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
involved with dcyf and on those cases we
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
will do we don't necessarily call them
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
investigations but we do do some reviews
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the system to ensure that they are
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
operating in the ways in which they
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
should that they're following their own
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
policies procedures and the laws that
 
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
exist and if they are not we will then
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
meet on those independent cases and make
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations to ensure that they do
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
follow the policies and laws
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
and so that is a good chunk of the work
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
that the assistant child advocate here
 
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Jones does as well as another
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
assistant child advocate in the office
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
so they do that independent case work
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
and managing the complaints that come
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
into the office
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
we also track those complaints in our
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
own computer system so that we can
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
follow Trends over time and we can
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
collect data and we use that data and
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
Trends to report back I do monthly
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
reporting to the oversight Commission on
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
children's services so we share there a
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
lot of the data and trends that we're
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
seeing and we also share them through
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
hearings if there's a hearing on a
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
particular topic that we've collected
 
00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
data and we have found Trends we will
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
ensure that we provide that information
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
here before you or other committees
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
typically it would be child and family
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
law Health and Human Services primarily
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
but there are times that the office also
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
ends up in House Education
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that's that that higher level and
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
then we also work with the agency on
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
improving their own policies and
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
practices so taking a look at best
 
00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
practice around the country we do a lot
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
of research focused on Child Development
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
on brain development and a focus on Aces
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
and we'll use that research and we will
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
advise on changes that they can make to
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
the system to improve the well-being for
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
of children in the state of New
 
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.130 align:start position:0%
of children in the state of New
Hampshire

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
with the division we also work with the
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau of children's Behavioral Health
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
doing much of the same at this point
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of research backing the
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatments a lot of which
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
have already rolled out in our state and
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we always do help advocate for
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
additional positions to fill that
 
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
because we see the need in the community
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
is extremely high there's a lot of
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
Acuity with our children across the
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
state right now so we're always
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
advocating for additional positions in
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
the evidence-based
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
practices that are available right now
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
as well as seeking out others that are
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
utilized in other areas in the country
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we could potentially bring to the
 
00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned we see high needs of
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
children at this time and what I mean by
 
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
that is the mental health needs of the
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
children across New Hampshire has
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
exacerbated over time we do believe a
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
lot of that is due to the impact of
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
coven and so we are watching that very
 
00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
closely and really working to see the
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
ways in which providers are serving
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
families that are effective in helping
 
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
spread that across the state but with
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
that we have seen a need of children
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
continuing to wait in emergency rooms
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
awaiting that higher level inpatient
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
Care at Hampstead Hospital
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
and if unable to be serviced at
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital unfortunately we're
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
finding that many of those families are
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
left without any follow-up or any
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
ability to connect with other systems
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
for care so we do receive some of those
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
through complaints and when we do we
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
ensure to refer them to the appropriate
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
service and ensure follow through for
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
that family that they were able to work
 
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
with that service to get the help that
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
they need in their family home
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
but that is a small impact so we try to
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
do that on a larger level through
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
education and Outreach and so we will do
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
education and Outreach with Community
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
provider agencies so that if they are
 
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:19.790 align:start position:0%
provider agencies so that if they are
seeing

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
families struggling with more complex
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
needs than they can meet that they can
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
refer those families to our office and
 
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
they know how to do so and we will also
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
do it with parent groups and with
 
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
children as well we often spend a lot of
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
time going out to the residential
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
facilities and meeting with children
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they that our number is
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
visible because children do have the
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
right to call our office at any time and
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
so we ensure that the facilities are
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
posting our numbers so children can see
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
that and that they know how to access
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
our office as well as offering them
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
times when we are out there to sit down
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
and meet with us individually one-on-one
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
for confidential conversation so they
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
can report any concerns that they may
 
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.569 align:start position:0%
can report any concerns that they may
have

00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
who designed your business card
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's incredible it's got your name and
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
then it says the child advocate
 
00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
what do you have a cape too I mean this
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
is cool really cool Sorry representative
 
00:48:17.339 --> 00:48:20.210 align:start position:0%
is cool really cool Sorry representative
Grossman

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
Grossman
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
being here I'm curious
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
do does that happen often where kids do
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
reach out
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
um calling the office or during these
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
confidential conversations that you have
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
when you visit a facility
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
are they using that yes they are we've
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
really put a concerted effort into
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the office is known as a
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
resource and this has taken some time
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
with Cova there's been a lot of barriers
 
00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:50.099 align:start position:0%
to that so this past year we've really
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
put an effort into being face to face
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
and meeting with these children so that
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
when they put a face to the name of the
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
office they knew they know who they're
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
calling they knew who they're going to
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
see on the other end of the phone and we
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
have received a lot more calls that way
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
we have children that we've connected
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
with in person at a facility and
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
something may occur a month or two later
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they're picking up the phone and
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
they're calling our office and they're
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
connecting with us so we are tracking to
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
see if we just finished our last annual
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
report so to see if our numbers from
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
last year increase from this coming year
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
and just by the numbers that we were
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
getting for calls so far in this annual
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
year so our annual year starts October
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
1st so the numbers that we've received
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
the number of calls we've received from
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
October to present
 
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
appears to already be an increase from
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
last year so those efforts seem to be
 
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.370 align:start position:0%
last year so those efforts seem to be
working

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
your presentation uh with respect to the
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
reports that you give to Children's
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
Services committee
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
um are those copied to CFL chairman or
 
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know are they posted on your web
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
they are posted on our website I do not
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
believe that they are are copied that is
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
something that we can do but currently I
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
do provide them in person during the
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
meetings and then we will post them on
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
the website so they are publicly
 
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.890 align:start position:0%
the website so they are publicly
accessible

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:14.900 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
how often did you say how often those
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
those meetings are monthly um just
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
skipping the summer months so you report
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
monthly yes okay great thank you thank
 
00:50:26.819 --> 00:50:28.910 align:start position:0%
monthly yes okay great thank you thank
you

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
I should know the answer to this because
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
I was the chairman of it for two years
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
do you regularly or periodically or once
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
in a great while report to DHHS
 
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is that the oversight commission
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
that takes place monthly yeah yeah but I
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
chaired for two years yeah I think you
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
were there weren't you I was not at that
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
time oh good it was my predecessor at
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean yeah well I'm back
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
on it I don't know whether I'll share it
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
or not but we'll see you again oh
 
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
wonderful one of the issues that comes
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
up periodically with some of us as
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives is we get a constituent
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
with a grievance and say do something
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
we can't always do something about it in
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
a policy committee because our purpose
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
is to examine and maybe change laws not
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
run grievances
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's a Temptation if somebody's all
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
steamed up and we kind of think they may
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
be right that we want to do something
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
here where that goes in these cases of
 
00:51:48.049 --> 00:51:48.059 align:start position:0%
children is to your office would that be
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes that is appropriate the DHHS
 
00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:53.579 align:start position:0%
also has an ombudsman which we refer to
 
00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
frequently but families can be guided in
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
our Direction and we would help them
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
with those steps in ensuring that they
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
know how to access the DHHS Ombudsman if
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
they had not done so already and once
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
they do reach out to the Ombudsman and
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
if they feel their problem has not been
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
resolved we oftentimes will look in the
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
case ensuring as long as we have the
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the issue that they're
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
taking a look at there are times that we
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
will get calls about
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
difficulties with their caseworker and
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
we will refer to the DHHS Ombudsman and
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
inform that that is not something that
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
we would look to resolve but if there is
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
a specific issue with what is happening
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
with their child on their case we would
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
be happy to look into it so before
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
referring out and just sending them off
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
we we do a lot of Education around
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
working with the system ensuring that
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
they know the steps and the appropriate
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
parties that they need to be in contact
 
00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
with on their case so yes we do accept
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
referrals we get them often
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
no different reps or Senators as well
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
where they'll be receiving calls from
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
families that feel that they have
 
00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:53.339 align:start position:0%
exhausted the system and do not have
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
anywhere else to go and we always do our
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
best to help them did I hear you
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
possibly suggest that one calls the DHHS
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman first before they call your
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
office did I hear that
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
so when we have a caller or complainant
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
call into our office we are required to
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
ask if they have if if the issue sits
 
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.130 align:start position:0%
ask if they have if if the issue sits
Within

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
Within
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
the scope of the DHHS Ombudsman we do
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
have to inquire whether they have
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
interacted with the Ombudsman if they
 
00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:23.819 align:start position:0%
have not we refer them there we will
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
hold their information until they
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
contact them and get back to us and let
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
us know whether the problem was resolved
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
or not but it is a requirement within
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
our statute that we send them to the
 
00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:37.859 align:start position:0%
DHHS Ombudsman so it would save a dime
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
as as long as it is within their
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction because our jurisdiction is
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
broader we can cover more but yes if it
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
is a specific
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
um dcyf or Bureau of children's
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
behavioral health issue then yes the
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS Ombudsman would be the first touch
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
point and do you have that number handy
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
I can guess the first six but it's the
 
00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
last four that's hard I don't have that
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but I can send
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
that along okay I'm wondering if you
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
might have that for us I bet you will
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%

um I just wanted to say I still have
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
week so I have the number for the
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%

-3948
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
according to the sheet that DHHS gave us
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.819 --> 00:54:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
Maybe

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
you see yet again pieces of paper go
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
faster than computers
 
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.569 align:start position:0%
faster than computers
okay

00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:56.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:56.579 --> 00:55:00.349 align:start position:0%

we'll find out okay any other questions
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%

as we get ready for opening our first
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:20.660 align:start position:0%
be one who testifies
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
you do get a chance to speak later
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
during exec time on bills however
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh secondly
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
um again I've been asked to remind us as
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
other chairs are doing that what we try
 
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
to do here is ask questions and not
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
testify there'll be plenty of time for
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
that I know sometimes the question is a
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
leading question but uh we have to be
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
careful to make sure we're asking
 
00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.690 align:start position:0%
careful to make sure we're asking
questions

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
third a straightforward bill
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
uh easy peasy housekeeping
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes turn into three-hour
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
hearings but more normally they are
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
actually straightforward and they can be
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
exact immediately afterwards if the
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
chair and vice chair or excuse me the
 
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
chair and the ranking member who in this
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
case is also the vice chair if we agree
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
if we want to go on and accept something
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
to get things onto the calendar that
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
look like it will be an easy Bill if we
 
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.650 align:start position:0%
look like it will be an easy Bill if we
agree

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise it has to be scheduled we can
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
no longer do it later in the day if
 
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
there's a Time Gap
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
and fourthly uh Republicans this is for
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
you I get to recommend to the speaker
 
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:40.800 align:start position:0%

these are fun for those of you who are
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
new to the house some of these can be
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
fun you learn all kinds of things you
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
get to meet a bunch of people that you
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be meeting here otherwise and
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to open the hearing on
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
126 relative to choosing the accrual
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
date for child support payments and the
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes chairman Spillane to
 
00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:57.299 align:start position:0%
come forward and present your bill
 
00:58:57.299 --> 00:59:03.170 align:start position:0%
come forward and present your bill
please

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.549 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping this is one of those
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
straightforward bills that we just had
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
um because I think that we all know that
 
00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:16.490 align:start position:0%
um because I think that we all know that
uh

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
people are paid at different schedules
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the month these days not
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's paid weekly and one of the
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
things I ran into
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
um as I pay child support myself
 
00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:30.059 align:start position:0%
currently is that um
 
00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
the lining up of when you have to pay
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
and when your other bills are stacking
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't always work
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
but what I and and there was no option
 
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
for me to change that accrual date or
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
the the due date to another
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
date in the month like you can with your
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
mortgage you can often say I don't like
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
the first I'd rather be on the 15th or
 
00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:53.579 align:start position:0%
I'd rather be on the seventh or
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
something like that because it works
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
better and so what I'm trying to do is
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
offer that flexibility of it I'd love to
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
see it be able to be so they could
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
choose any week in the month but I think
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
that a simple step forward is to give
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
them at least the choice of the the
 
01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
beginning of the month or the middle of
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
the month and give them the choice of
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
either the first or the 15th for their
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
due date
 
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and that's all this bill does it uh
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
it basically changes that every single
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
child support payer in the state be on
 
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
the first to let's let child support
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
payer choose the first or the 15th
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions if anyone has
 
01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.049 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions if anyone has
any

01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:37.220 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and uh thank you
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Spillane I'm curious
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
about how this change would affect our
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
office of child our Department of Child
 
01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:46.819 align:start position:0%
Support Services
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
at Health and Human Services because
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
right now they all pay process the
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
payments at the same time will that
 
01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
change their staffing needs or their
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
operational needs in any way I don't
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
expect that it would have any change in
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
anything except for probably an update
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
to the system software wise to allow uh
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to happen
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
and for those people who have
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the pay taken out of their check it
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any difference anyway
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
because it comes out every single pay
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
period and and they just continue
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
accruing constantly this would mainly
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
affect people who have another agreement
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
with their spouse and or pay in other
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
ways and so I think the department could
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
probably better answer that but whereas
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
as there was no fiscal note attached to
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
this I don't think there's a huge impact
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I cannot answer anything beyond
 
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
potentially a software update to allow
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
the first to the 15th is that something
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
that each person can choose every month
 
01:02:06.049 --> 01:02:06.059 align:start position:0%
or is it set once they choose one
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
well I would imagine they could go and
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
ask for it to be changed in the future
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
if their employment changed because we
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
always have the ability if our
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
employment changes or some some major
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
thing changes to talk to uh Division of
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services about changing
 
01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
how much child support or what have you
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
but that's usually done involving the
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
court and I would imagine that once they
 
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
choose their date that would be the date
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
unless something changed that they
 
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you and
 
01:02:45.890 --> 01:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today can
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
you see of an impact on the payee with
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
like bills being due at the first of the
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
month or whatever what kind of impact
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
would this have to move it to the middle
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
if they have like the child care costs
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
or anything they're getting that payment
 
01:02:56.819 --> 01:02:58.609 align:start position:0%
or anything they're getting that payment
for

01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
well again that that is that is a
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
potential uh thing that needs to be
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
looked at usually this date is not done
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
in isolation it's done in agreement
 
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
during the discussion on child support
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
during the court period
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
um and if the payments are coming on
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
time and never falling behind
 
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:21.059 align:start position:0%
then there wouldn't be a problem because
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
the person would always have that check
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
coming every month from Division of
 
01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
if somebody falls behind then it becomes
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
more of a problem with them getting
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
their their pay on time their their
 
01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:37.460 align:start position:0%
child support on time and falling behind
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
is something I'm trying to avoid with
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
this where somebody repeatedly is
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
falling behind every month because
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
everything's due on the first and they'd
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
be much
 
01:03:46.859 --> 01:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
be much
better

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
able to pay on a 15th then to try to
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
manage their finances to try to fit it
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
in with their mortgage or rent or
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
whatever those they're also paying at
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so that would then fall on the
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
payee to
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
um you know talk to their bill people
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
and say hey I'm not getting this till
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
the 15th so that they would need to
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
switch that unless it's you know they
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
are able to save up that half a month or
 
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
whatever well I imagine that if if
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's any issues where it needs to be
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
on the first and that's not going to
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
work out for them that would be brought
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
up in the child support discussion court
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
before it even happened or with the
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
mediator if an employment situation
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
changes because both parties get to
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
speak all the time right now anyway
 
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.010 align:start position:0%
speak all the time right now anyway
about

01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
um what their situations are and they
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
submit their financials and they talk
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
about the whole landscape of everything
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
before any decisions are made about how
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
much it is and and all this and whether
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
it's done automatically from pay
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
that's all discussed so
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
I would hope and I would imagine that
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
that discussion comes up when there's a
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
court mediator to say you know what your
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
your payee is not going to be able to
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
function on the 15th so as much as it
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
would work out for you we can't do that
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
would you assume that in uh the
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
conversations between a person and that
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
person's ex and the court
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
since we're moving from the first of the
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
month to the 15th of the next month
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
there might be a gap half months payment
 
01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:21.299 align:start position:0%
otherwise we've some people could have a
 
01:05:21.299 --> 01:05:21.950 align:start position:0%
otherwise we've some people could have a
problem

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
I guess it depends on when it would be
 
01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
implemented as a as a change because
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
um if it's starting out with a brand new
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
case that has just been decided in court
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
there's been no payments yet it's going
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
straight on to child support on the 15th
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody's changing from the first to
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
the 15th I know that that Division of
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services often has to
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
manage when it comes out of pay that
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen on a weekly basis
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
um how to catch up
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
and so I've seen it myself with um where
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
they say now there's an additional x
 
01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
amount due every period for the next
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know three pay periods to try to
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
catch up
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
representative Grossman
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
representative for coming before us
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
so in your situation where you already
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
are in an agreement with a set due date
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
because you've gone through the process
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
how would this impact folks that already
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
have a set date because they've already
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
been through that process so it doesn't
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
describe in here any way that they could
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
change it they would have to petition to
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
the court to make a change to their
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
and both parties can submit this without
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
an attorney it doesn't cost anything
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
they just have to submit a written
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
agreement between them that they want to
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
change it or the one person can petition
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
that they would like to change it and
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
send copies to the other person and then
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
they get into the discussion with the
 
01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
mediator even if they both agree to it
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
it goes before the mediator to look at
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
their financials again discuss the
 
01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
situation and decide whether they can
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
change to it if I was to to do that from
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
my case which I'm not interested in I'm
 
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with where it's at but
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
um I would have to basically start that
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
process by discussing with my ex and
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
deciding do we want to do this jointly
 
01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:21.420 align:start position:0%
do we both agree on this if so let's
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
just submit it we'll ask them to go
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
ahead and approve it
 
01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
they'll look at it discuss things with
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
us and approve it or if we can't come to
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
agreement on it the mediator gets to
 
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
look at both situations and decide
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
is that person constantly falling late
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
and is that a problem versus is this
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
person needing that money on the first
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
is that the problem where do we come to
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the middle but at least gives them the
 
01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
flexibility to say works better for both
 
01:07:49.370 --> 01:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
parties let's do it that way
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
do you think that this may create a
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
problem in the family courts though in
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
terms of dealing with two parties that
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
already may not I mean this is what the
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
heart of the matter in divorce
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
proceedings is
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
other than the children obviously but
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
the conflict resolution in terms of the
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
monetary so if now
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
the court people can go back and refile
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
for a new motion but they both have to
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
agree to file for that motion
 
01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
agree to file for that motion
so

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay let's not get too complicated on it
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
because I need to break these down as a
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
lot there
 
01:08:34.679 --> 01:08:35.570 align:start position:0%
lot there
um

01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
child support is always the most one of
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
the most contentious things in the
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
divorce custody and child support we
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
none of it's done
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
outside of the Court
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the formulas and doing the
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
mediation on things and essentially
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
anytime I want to petition I had a
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
period uh three years ago where I lost
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
my job laid off during covid I had to
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
petition to the court to change the
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.849 --> 01:09:06.859 align:start position:0%
that was a petition to the court
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
explained why new financials from both
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
parties we have to get on the phone they
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
look at the financials they run the
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
formula again they decide when it's due
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
this would just add one more aspect into
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
discussing the financials that says
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
would you like the due date on the first
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
or the 15th does that work for both of
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
you if not why
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
um it's not dragging open a new area
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
um this is about public assistance the
 
01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.410 align:start position:0%
um this is about public assistance the
bill

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't trigger until there's
 
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh someone applies to say welfare
 
01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:55.219 align:start position:0%
no no no see that it says on line three
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
made to or for the benefit of the
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
dependent child creates a debt due to
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
the department not to the child but to
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
the department because the child has
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
well it's already gotten this is under
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
the entire statute though I'm not sure
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
why they put it there um we can look at
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
that and figure out why they put it
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
there but this this is under the entire
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
section about when
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
the due date is to child support to the
 
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
Division of Child Support Services
 
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.530 align:start position:0%
Division of Child Support Services
um

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:29.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
and so it's supposed to be outside of
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
the public assistance area there is a
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
trigger within requesting for public
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
assistance that requires that it be
 
01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
um garnished from wages yeah okay
 
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.390 align:start position:0%
um garnished from wages yeah okay
um

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
basically makes the question of the
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
first or the 15th move if it's being
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
garnished from the wages because it's
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
being taken out at every pay period at
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
that point so um
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's a good question why it starts with
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
that section on line three but it should
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
not be addressing that it should be
 
01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
not be addressing that it should be
addressing

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
I have 161 C4 in front of me any payment
 
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
of Public Assistance made two or for the
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
benefit of a dependent child creates a
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
debt due and owing to the department by
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
any responsible parent except as
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided in 161 C5 the amount
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
of debt shall be equal to the
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
calculation and it goes on into a bunch
 
01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
of numbers
 
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:35.689 align:start position:0%
of numbers
it's

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
a modification of how that happens from
 
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.490 align:start position:0%
a modification of how that happens from
only

01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
on the first to what you propose so
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's why it's worded as it is it's
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
getting us a running Head Start
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
by quoting that whole little section
 
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.290 align:start position:0%
by quoting that whole little section
and

01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:53.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
my further assumption would be then that
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
they consider the fact that you have a
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
debt owed that's paid through the
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Child and Family Services
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
as being
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
a route through the public assistance
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
area because they handle the payment the
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
payment goes to
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
Division of Child Support Services which
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
is then
 
01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
passed along to the parent
 
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.490 align:start position:0%
passed along to the parent
yeah

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
that's the section yeah
 
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
you may have just follow up yeah follow
 
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
you may have just follow up yeah follow
up

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony it sounds like
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
you need to get back into another piece
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the law to cover what you want to
 
01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:32.209 align:start position:0%
of the law to cover what you want to
accomplish

01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and you so I'm just I guess I trusted
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
the experts in this area to put it in
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
the right place and I'm hoping that this
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
committee can also make sure it's in the
 
01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:44.540 align:start position:0%
right place but it should be
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
governing all of the due dates for child
 
01:12:47.219 --> 01:12:49.130 align:start position:0%
governing all of the due dates for child
support

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether it's garnished
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
or not because it wouldn't make any
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
difference but to basically change that
 
01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
um due date so that the person had the
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
flexibility to decide
 
01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives belaying the Bill's
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor seeing none thank you so
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you members of the committee
 
01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes Vivian Gerard
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
she wishes to speak for three minutes
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
and you are rising in opposition to the
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and members of the
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Vivian Gerard a
 
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
formerly Silva and a lot of you probably
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
know me as a Silva V Silva case I
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
disagree with this bill and I don't
 
01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
think it makes any difference putting a
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
date on the child support So passing
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is very irrelevant and I
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
believe as you had said that it really
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
goes back to the tandiff cases
 
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:53.450 align:start position:0%
goes back to the tandiff cases
um

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
where this really is it doesn't make
 
01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:57.890 align:start position:0%
where this really is it doesn't make
sense

01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
so um from my experience
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
um I've been
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
I've had 25 herons and five appeals
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
basically on child support
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that I mean granted I
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
did have three bad judges but I can see
 
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:16.140 align:start position:0%
how this bill would work more with
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
somebody that is a W-2 employee
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
if somebody is self-employed
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make sense for them and if
 
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:26.900 align:start position:0%
anything is only going to hurt them more
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
if anything I would say make an
 
01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill and
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
have it so if somebody is self-employed
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I am as well so I can really relate
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
to this but I'm on the opposite side of
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
life here I'm the one collecting the
 
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
paychecks my ex is a w two earner
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think that if somebody struggles
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
paying their child support
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
that if anything you would give them
 
01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a grace period for 60 days
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
to make up that amount that they could
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
not pay so putting a date on there for
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
say the 15th whether they're a
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
self-employed employee or not it really
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and and the other part that I really
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
have a hard time with is the Department
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
of child's child support
 
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
is so quick to pull somebody's driver's
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
license if you do not make that date and
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
the sad thing is
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
um that is preventing them from paying
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
it and we'll set them back even further
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I've been sitting at the um
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
Courthouse listening to these child
 
01:15:32.689 --> 01:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
support cases because I'm very
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
interested in how this stuff happens
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
and they are very quick to put a
 
01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty on these people that
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
miss that one day and they're not
 
01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:47.219 align:start position:0%
looking at it as okay this is a
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
self-employed person rather than
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
somebody that's a W-2 earner
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
so I feel that um
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
putting these dates on again is very
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
irrelevant because if you're dealing
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
with somebody that makes a hundred and
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars a year they have
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
no problem whether the the dates on the
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
first of the 15th
 
01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.110 align:start position:0%
first of the 15th
um

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
so in my case yes this caused quite a
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
bit of strain on my family financially
 
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
and my ex even though he is a W2 earner
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
and he was supposed to pay it on a
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
certain day he paid what he wanted when
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
he felt like it so the dates were very
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
irrelevant for him and the gentleman
 
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
that spoke before me made it so easy to
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
sound like oh just go up and ask for
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
another date it's not like that it is
 
01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
very contentious and me above all people
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
can tell you I've been in the court
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
system for nine years and I still don't
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
have an order on my child support
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
um basically for the arrears granted
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
again I had three bad judges so it
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
really is not
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
um helpful in that case but I think that
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
this would be very dangerous to families
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
and individuals sorry individuals where
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
if you start putting these limitations
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
on them and put in certain dates again I
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
don't think that they need anything are
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
you willing to take questions you're
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
starting to repeat yourself so and
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's good I mean it's good that you
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
said what you did but uh would you take
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
any questions absolutely
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay and also I do have um a couple of
 
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
handouts here because if you could give
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
them at the end of the table and pass
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
them down absolutely thank you so much
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes Matthew Hayes
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%

I am a staff attorney for the Bureau of

liaison my name is Matthew Hayes
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the mural of Child Support is
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
essentially uh created out of the
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
child's um
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just uh bring out a few
 
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh statutes to know committee's
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
attention that might conflict with this
 
01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
attention that might conflict with this
bill

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
um my wave definition uh child support
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
arrears represent the amount of child
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
support that remains unpaid it is owed
 
01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:48.980 align:start position:0%
either to the family or the government
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
when a family applies for public
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
assistance such as TANF temporary system
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
could you quote since I have the
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
statutes here would you be willing to
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
quote them as you read them yes um I can
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
and I also have a handout that provides
 
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
one of the ones I'm going to talk about
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
the most I have a number of copies I can
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
leave here that everyone can look at
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
after but essentially I'm talking a
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:14.630 align:start position:0%
little bit about
um

01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
on rears because
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
this statue does appear to be placed in
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
a statute that talks about public
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
assistance so I was addressing that
 
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
generally in our situation when we
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
enforce cases the arrears are
 
01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:30.380 align:start position:0%
essentially IR owed to us
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
because a child support owner accrued
 
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
during a time where an obligene was
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
receiving TANF assistance in which case
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
those accruals would belong to the state
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
but in particular I draw on the
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to RSA 458
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
excuse me B4
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
3 which this statute essentially deals
 
01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.110 align:start position:0%
3 which this statute essentially deals
with

01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:19:58.850 --> 01:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
wage assignments and in particular that
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
provision deals with the amount that's
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
withheld when an employer is withholding
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
child support that employer must
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
withhold a sufficient amount to meet the
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
obligation the ongoing obligation
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
as well as an extra 20 percent that goes
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
towards payment on arrears
 
01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
towards payment on arrears
um so

01:20:22.669 --> 01:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think that has to be rent to show that
 
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.410 align:start position:0%
I think that has to be rent to show that
um when

01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
um when
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
the employer takes the money that
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't really have an option
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
to uh bifurcate you know oh this is
 
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
going to be applied to the ongoing Sport
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
and and this will go apply to
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
10 FM readers and I'm I'm not entirely
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure when I prepared this testimony I
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
know there's a couple different
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
directions I thought maybe this could go
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to provide the
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
convenience general information about
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
where I think conflicts might exist
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I think in particular the committee
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
should be aware of also in that same
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
statute 458 B6
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh this that provision deals with uh
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
employers and requirements of employers
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
in particular paragraph four requires
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
the employer to send
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
withheld amounts immediately
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
to the payee or the department they're
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
not permitted to just hang collect it at
 
01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
a certain time of the month
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh almost maybe an escrow
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
and then provide that at a later date
 
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
they have to immediately
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
pay those funds when the employer
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
receives them or when the employee
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
receives them
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
um I also have a quick
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
I have another stature I want to talk
 
01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
about but I don't know if it would be
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
easier to take the question or if the
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
hit if the committee is finding what I
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
said already helpful but before you do
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that the bill
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
before us
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
um should have been placed in 458b
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
rather than where it is assigned here
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
I think it would be problematic I think
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
that what the bill is trying to
 
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
accomplish sounds to me problematic with
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
the whole structure of the payments in
 
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.850 align:start position:0%
the whole structure of the payments in
general

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
um it seems to conflict with how wage
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
garnishments work and it does seem to
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
conflict with how accruals of the child
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
support work and the other statute I was
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
going to talk about
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
was the nature of the child support
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
order itself all child support orders in
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are judgments and
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
according to a different statute RSA 461
 
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.669 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
under this chapter shall be deemed to
 
01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
judgments when due and payable
 
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.070 align:start position:0%
judgments when due and payable
so

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
the bureau as at this point isn't taking
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
a position necessarily uh or or against
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
I put neutral on my card hope that's
 
01:23:00.719 --> 01:23:02.450 align:start position:0%
I put neutral on my card hope that's
okay

01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I just think that some of these
 
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
statutes definitely seem to apply and it
 
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.790 align:start position:0%
statutes definitely seem to apply and it
seems

01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
um just sort of
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
they don't mix very well with
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
structuring a date that's due on at the
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
oblique horse choice on the first or the
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
15th of the month
 
01:23:24.169 --> 01:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
um so I I'm just going to conclude as
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
far as my written testimony I do have
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
that I can submit
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take questions and I've
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
also included my card on the information
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you thank you
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony uh now
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding from a bill last term
 
01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
that there are some court orders that
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
don't have a date
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're ordered to pay 145 dollars a week
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and as my understanding is there well
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
well are you of that understanding that
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
there are some court orders that don't
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
specify a date
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
um the court order the uniform support
 
01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
um the court order the uniform support
order

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't provide an exact date what it
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
would do is it says the effective date
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
of this order is
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
um you know to January 17 of 2023 that's
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
the first let's say that's the first
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
date that the order goes into effect
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
and somebody is to pay 144 dollars per
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
week I think that's what you said
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
um effective January 17 2023. today's a
 
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so essentially every Tuesday
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
that will be an accrual
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
um that obligation becomes due on this
 
01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
um that obligation becomes due on this
date

01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.649 align:start position:0%
date
um

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
um and uh are you aware that some people
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are getting the child support
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time because it's
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
sporadic so it's not a specific date
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's yeah
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
you get it one month at the first week
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
you get it another month at the third
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
week you get in another month off the
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
second week is is that are you aware of
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
that situation happening
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately you know wage
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
garnishment is the preferred method for
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
collecting child support unfortunately
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
when there is not a wage garnishment for
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
example if somebody is self-employed
 
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
it's it's difficult you're relying on
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
them to make the payments and if they
 
01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.050 align:start position:0%
them to make the payments and if they
don't

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
um there's certain enforcement remedies
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
that can happen if it's payable through
 
01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.850 align:start position:0%
that can happen if it's payable through
us

01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
um parties are certainly willing to file
 
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
motions to contempt if it's not payable
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
through us but
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
um yes unfortunately some people do not
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
make payments on time and without a wage
 
01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.450 align:start position:0%
make payments on time and without a wage
garnishment

01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
garnishment
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's sort of on them to make them on
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
time and that doesn't always happen
 
01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:01.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:01.139 --> 01:26:02.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of not
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
paying support for the month it's just a
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
matter of paying at different times
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
where the recipient of the child support
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
is getting paid at different times so
 
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
this month I'm getting paid on the first
 
01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.149 align:start position:0%
this month I'm getting paid on the first
week

01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
the next month on the third week so
 
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's it's not consistent it's not
 
01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:22.129 align:start position:0%
there's it's not consistent it's not
that

01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
the person paying is missing the payment
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's the day that he pays so I'm asking
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
you I you know you said that this bill
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
would be problematic I'm asking you if
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
that would suffice if you pick a time
 
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh that would be cons that would draw
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
more consistency
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
I just feel that they're already there
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
already are due dates and this I guess
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
uh spells out
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know once a month like you could
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
already have a court order that in a
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
cruise once a month on the first of the
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
month I mean parties could agree to that
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
and then on the first of the month they
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
owe 800
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and then they have to pay it and then
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
if they don't there's certain things
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
that can happen but
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
um that's how my that's my understanding
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
of how the court order Works
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a judgment essentially
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it is payable when do
 
01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
thank you chairperson and thank you Mr
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
hat to explain this to us can you I ask
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
a question in a little bit broader
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
context could you tell us please
 
01:27:36.239 --> 01:27:37.370 align:start position:0%
context could you tell us please
um

01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.410 align:start position:0%
um
approximately

01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
um how many of the cases of Child
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
Support like what's the ratio between
 
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
ones that are wage garnished through
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
your office versus you know people
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
having just a court order and working it
 
01:27:54.649 --> 01:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
out because as I'm reading this I'm
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
confused as to how as to whether or not
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would affect the people who
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
are being waged garnished or only people
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I I think that thank you for
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
um representative I don't I'm not sure
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
and you if you're looking for numbers as
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
far as how many cases we have wage
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
garnishments out as far as how many
 
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
cases we enforce I'd have to get those I
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
don't know I have them on top of my head
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
but I think there could be a way to do
 
01:28:22.199 --> 01:28:23.330 align:start position:0%
but I think there could be a way to do
it

01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.010 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like and again I I don't want
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
to presume something in the bill I'm
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
just sort of
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly how it fits in
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
based on where it's been placed but
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to be repetitive but it
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
does seem too conflict I mean the money
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
if you have a wage garnishment set up
 
01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
and it's whether it's
 
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:46.970 align:start position:0%
and it's whether it's
um

01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
a tan of case or not TANF case the
 
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
employer is told by ours our Bureau that
 
01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
if this person gets paid bi-weekly this
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
is how much you take out this will help
 
01:28:57.659 --> 01:28:58.970 align:start position:0%
is how much you take out this will help
cover

01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
the ongoing support and it'll help go
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
towards the arrears it's sort of
 
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
happens a little bit separate from the
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
way in which they crew so sometimes in a
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
cruel happened and then next social
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
happens an employee gets paid you know
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
the next week so as long as the payments
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
have been coming in every month then
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
they continue to be in compliance
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's almost like they're sort of
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's just a couple different ways
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different components to
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
the payments in in the child support
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
world thank you
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll be quick and thank you for
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what you're saying
 
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
is there's no according to what the
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
information that you have there's no
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
set like it has to be on the first it's
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
kind of individual judgments so maybe
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
making a law where it's one of two dates
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
could complicate it sorry I'm just
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around all of it
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
um I think it I think it could
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
complicate things especially if a court
 
01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
would order that the payments are
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be weekly
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
um the court might order you know in in
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child that you
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
know I think the payment should be 144
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
per week so in theory the obligation to
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
be getting paid 144 dollars per week
 
01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.649 align:start position:0%
be getting paid 144 dollars per week
um

01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
so there's there's that practical aspect
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
um I have a question isn't it really
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
your Department's concern
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
that you take money in
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
and pay money out and the specifics are
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
really between the parties and the court
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
system the department is basically just
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
the bank
 
01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
uh that is we that is part of a role and
 
01:30:37.729 --> 01:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
01:30:37.739 --> 01:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
I think that
um

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
I think the issue where it gets
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
complicated is if this does conflict
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
with wage garnishment statutes so those
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
wage cars with statutes are
 
01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
mandated by federal law CFR and I'm not
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
saying this seeks to change that I'm
 
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
just saying if there are conflicts with
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
the way in which the department is able
 
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
to get money into the obligies and again
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
this this was placed in the
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
Public Assistance portion of the statute
 
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
so that was another reason why the
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
bureau had to be here um I think to help
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
explain what our thoughts are
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay I've just read the support section
 
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
461 so it maybe should have gone there
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
and that's not a question but it should
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
have been representative Bickford
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you uh Mr Hayes
 
01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.149 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you uh Mr Hayes
um

01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
back some time ago when the federal
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
government came to us and said you're
 
01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
going to have to do wage assignment or
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose 21 million dollars
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
um we did come up with an option which
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
was to allow people to have some I can't
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
remember the checking account or some
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
kind of account where a person could put
 
01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
their money in
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then take it out thanks to our vice
 
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
chair Randy Lyman at the time is that
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
still in existence
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh I think parties if you uh thank you
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
for your question sir um representative
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes people can wave out of wage
 
01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.030 align:start position:0%
yes people can wave out of wage
garnishments

01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
garnishments
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
um if they're if the court orders that's
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the case then
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
there's Provisions for that in there and
 
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
we are able to
 
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:11.060 align:start position:0%
um have a part of our department
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
essentially take the money in and and
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
provide it to the other theology so
 
01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
there's certainly many cases where we
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't uh have very little involvement in
 
01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
the case
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
other than taking the money in uh and
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
dispersing it to your point Mr chair
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for example isn't it to your
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
point that liens are mentioned or the
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
requirement of a previous pay or to go
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
on food stamps and again that is really
 
01:32:42.169 --> 01:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
not your concern as long as the
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
department gets the money that it will
 
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
then expense
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
um am I correct in assuming that you'd
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
the department does not actively do the
 
01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
liens on property or the legal
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
requirements of getting food stamps I'm
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
not sure about food stamps but I know
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
for liens if if there's an order payable
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
through us then and we're charged with
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of that order then liens
 
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
are one of our enforcement tools and
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's something that the department
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
would do
 
01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
and you had some stuff for us I think
 
01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
you said I do would you like me to yeah
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
to the committee my name again is
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
Deborah D Simone I represent Atkinson
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 18.
 
01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:52.100 align:start position:0%
when I saw this bill
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
and spoke with the sponsor of the bill
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
he did a little bit of research and one
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
of the issues or a few of the issues
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been brought up yet so far
 
01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.689 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been brought up yet so far
is

01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
the consistency of payments whether they
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
be through garnish mint of wages or
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
personal pay
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
it has been brought up and the
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
discussion has been made concerning the
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
fact that somebody could get their child
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
support on January 2nd but then not see
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
it until February 28th
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
so this would create more consistency
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
but one of the more serious issues
 
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
I think is
 
01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:41.270 align:start position:0%
I think is
that

01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
there are many times where your child
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
support payments if in the case of
 
01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.790 align:start position:0%
support payments if in the case of
garnishment

01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
garnishment
 
01:34:51.310 --> 01:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
DHHS and you get paid on the 15th but
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're expecting your payment on the
 
01:35:03.649 --> 01:35:03.659 align:start position:0%
10th and in the interim you apply for a
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
passport because your employer is
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
sending you to another country for work
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
your passport will be denied because
 
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
you're behind on child support
 
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
in the case of a similar case you apply
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
to renew your driver's license and your
 
01:35:28.930 --> 01:35:28.940 align:start position:0%
driver's license renewal will be denied
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
because you're behind on child support
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
payments even though your monthly salary
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
bi-weekly bi-monthly salary or whatever
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
is garnished so I think we need to take
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
that into consideration that this bill
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
could create more consistency and people
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
who are up to date on their child
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
support payments would no longer be
 
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.270 align:start position:0%
support payments would no longer be
considered

01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
considered
delinquent

01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for the
 
01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.729 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for the
representative

01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as much as I had
 
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
hoped we could go to an exec session on
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
this the ranking member and I both
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
are of the opinion that the prime
 
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor might wish to check with
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
an attorney to see if what he requests
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
could be cited differently I wrote down
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
the RSA numbers here if you want them
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
later it does seem to me to fit better
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
there and it might
 
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
um not lead to the confusion that some
 
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
are I believe having by it being way in
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
the front of the book and so we're going
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
to hold on to this and come back with um
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
some perhaps different sightings
 
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
and that closes the hearing on House
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
and now I open the hearing on House Bill
 
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.450 align:start position:0%
and now I open the hearing on House Bill
108.

01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
108.
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
and although he needs no introduction
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to do it representative
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
committee again
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
um this bill is one that I worked hard
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
on the last term uh with the directors
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
is it Commissioner of dcyf
 
01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:47.629 align:start position:0%
is it Commissioner of dcyf
um

01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
we amended it we amended it again we
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
came up with language that really worked
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
well we got it passed through the house
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
and it stalled in the Senate and ended
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
up retained while they looked into
 
01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.450 align:start position:0%
up retained while they looked into
things

01:37:59.450 --> 01:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:01.729 align:start position:0%
things
um but

01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
this was
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
done with the agreement of division of
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
child uh children youth and families
 
01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
dcyf to try and
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
place in place
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
um a penalty for making false claims to
 
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
um a penalty for making false claims to
dcyf

01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
as things stand in the state of New
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can pull a fire alarm and I
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
can get charged for it
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh if there's no fire I can make a call
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
into the police with there not being a
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
real threat and I can get charged with
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
that false claim but I can call in on my
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
neighbor because they threw trash on my
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
lawn and say they're abusing their kids
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
and there's no penalty even if I did it
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
maliciously with bad intent to try to
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
get dcyf involved in their family
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty at all
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that can be done
 
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.830 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that can be done
so

01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
the big point of this bill is
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
that we did not
 
01:39:00.649 --> 01:39:00.659 align:start position:0%
make the bar easy to get over it's a
 
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
high bar it says that they must make the
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
accusation maliciously and with bad
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
intent with intent to harm
 
01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:09.830 align:start position:0%
intent with intent to harm
so

01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.629 align:start position:0%
so
there's

01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
agreement that there would be very
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
little chance that a first-time person
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
who was concerned about a child and did
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
call would ever get charged with this
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
but a person who repeatedly calls and
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
makes false complaints that they can
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
actually make the the proof in court
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
that the person did it maliciously and
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
with intent to harm
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
um they could be charged with this so
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
that it could serve as a deterrent from
 
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
people making false accusations and
 
01:39:38.930 --> 01:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
using the department
 
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:39.709 align:start position:0%
using the department
um

01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
as a weaponized way to get back at a an
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
ex or another family that took uh
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
custody of the children temporarily or
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
so the first part of the bill simply
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
says that the first around line 10
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it says that reports
 
01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:57.659 align:start position:0%
made to the department may include the
 
01:39:59.689 --> 01:39:59.699 align:start position:0%
name address or phone number originally
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
I had wanted to get rid of all Anonymous
 
01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
reports turned out not a great idea to
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
make that jump forward but let's let's
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
try to discourage Anonymous reports
 
01:40:12.169 --> 01:40:12.179 align:start position:0%
whenever possible so
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
um we're leaving it up to the person
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking the call at dcyf to ask for that
 
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
information if they want to and if the
 
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
person is is really adamant they want to
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
do it anonymously they can still do that
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
we did not change that at all we've just
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
put in the ability that they they have
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
written here now they have the ability
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
to make a reminder I was told last term
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
from the um
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
director of dcyf that the staff that
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
takes these calls is few in number
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
and they tend to get to know certain
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
people who are repeat callers
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
so they can remind them that there's a
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
criminal statute once this passes and
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
say do you really want to make this
 
01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:50.750 align:start position:0%
say do you really want to make this
complaint

01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
when they know when they recognize the
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
caller somebody who's done been a repeat
 
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.450 align:start position:0%
caller somebody who's done been a repeat
caller

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
caller
 
01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.470 align:start position:0%
caller
um

01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
for unfounded cases but that is also a
 
01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
may they don't have to tell them and
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
make that reminder it just gives them
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to ask for that and to make
 
01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
that reminder
 
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's
 
01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.890 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's
that's

01:41:12.890 --> 01:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
set in stone here that must be followed
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
is the fact that it is now as if you
 
01:41:19.610 --> 01:41:19.620 align:start position:0%
look at line 22 we're adding the fact
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
that it will be a misdemeanor to
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
knowingly make false statements of
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
suspected child abuse
 
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
to the department to any Court to any
 
01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency or to any Social
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
Service Agency or to any mandatory
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
reporter of suspected child abuse
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
any person who knowingly or in bad faith
 
01:41:40.189 --> 01:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
makes a false report of suspected child
 
01:41:40.199 --> 01:41:41.209 align:start position:0%
makes a false report of suspected child
abuse

01:41:41.209 --> 01:41:41.219 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
may be subject to those penalties so it
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
has to be made with bad faith knowingly
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know that it's a false accusation
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
you make it anyway
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
and that's when this would kick in aside
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
from that we've preserved every ability
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
for somebody who has the slightest
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
inkling that there's abuse going on to
 
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
be able to make that call without any
 
01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
fear of charges it's only for those Bad
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
actors who have shown repeatedly that
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
they've they we can now prove it in
 
01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:11.209 align:start position:0%
they've they we can now prove it in
court

01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:19.129 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative panic thank you chairman
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
how can you prove a false claim
 
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
um as I said this would never apply to a
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
first person because you can't prove
 
01:42:36.169 --> 01:42:36.179 align:start position:0%
that somebody knowingly
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
made that that false accusation the
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
first time but I have had I have a
 
01:42:42.119 --> 01:42:43.609 align:start position:0%
first time but I have had I have a
constituent

01:42:43.609 --> 01:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:45.659 align:start position:0%
who lives in a part of the state not in
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
one of my towns but has reached out to
 
01:42:49.609 --> 01:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
me last term
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
when this was going on
 
01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
has been going through a divorce for
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
over three years
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
and was getting calls for child from
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
division of child support dcyf
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
every two or three weeks
 
01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
because the
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
separated husband's new girlfriend was
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
making calls in to try to sway the
 
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
divorce process by getting on record
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
that there's an abuse going on so in
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
that instance it's repeated
 
01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
there's proof that it's happening they
 
01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
were anonymous
 
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
but I have no doubt that at some point
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the department could put together a
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
pattern and identify the numbers the
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
calls are coming from or some such
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for them to try to put
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
that pattern together right now because
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
there's nothing they can do there's no
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
way they can charge somebody from
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
repeatedly making a false accusation
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
when this statute passes
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
they now have the ability to investigate
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
when those abuses are taking place and
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
this isn't just about
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
geez it's kind of annoying to have dcyf
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
called on me every three weeks this
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
causes emotional turmoil in the family
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
it causes
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
traumatic damage to the children that
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
are involved in it
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
um because they get pulled out of bed in
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night so an officer
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
can look for wounds on their body
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
and this also takes away vital resources
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
from dcyf that they could be putting on
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
now in a discussion with the director
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
last time I was told that because of our
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
increase in the opioid problem one of
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
the problems they're finding now is that
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of placements are taking place
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
with the grandparents and you run into a
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
situation where this grandparent's upset
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
that that grandparent got custody and
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
this one didn't so this one's making
 
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
calls to dcyf about that grandparent
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
because they feel they should have had
 
01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.139 align:start position:0%
custody instead
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
and the system is getting weaponized and
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that can be done by the
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
state to stop it at the moment
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking that you give serious
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
thought to passing this again we passed
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
it last year we didn't get it through
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate but I have every confidence
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
that this year we can get it through the
 
01:45:03.229 --> 01:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
Senate and we can put a stop to the
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Representatives Blaine I've
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
worked in a state that has this statute
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
I worked in New York for dcif there well
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's different agency but it doesn't
 
01:45:20.159 --> 01:45:21.290 align:start position:0%
it's different agency but it doesn't
matter

01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is regarding the part of
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
your bill here where it says may be
 
01:45:30.729 --> 01:45:30.739 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal and civil penalties
 
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
so who are who would be tasks with
 
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
investigating whether this was
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
maliciously done
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
maliciously or falsely knowingly falsely
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
reported and then how does one approach
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
this in the civil court so I'm
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
envisioning police in my experience
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
police have gone out and done it good
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
question good question
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
um the thing we wanted to allow was that
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
such as in the instance of the um the
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
divorce situation where the claims were
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
being made repeatedly and disrupting the
 
01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:07.580 align:start position:0%
lives of four children and a mother
 
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
that there was some ability for her to
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
civilly recover damages
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
after that
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
criminal charge was proven so that's in
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
there so that if it's proven by the
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
investigation of the department and the
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
police that this person has made these
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh repeated false accusations and is
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
guilty of the misdemeanor that then that
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
opens it up to a civil complaint that
 
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:34.340 align:start position:0%
can allow that person to recover damages
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
whether it be
 
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
counseling costs for the children
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
because of the incident
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
um lost days at work for the person who
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
was injured by the the calls made
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
against them that were false any of that
 
01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
could be recovered civilly to allow them
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
to try to recover some Port of part of
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
would you believe that as a mandatory
 
01:47:07.679 --> 01:47:09.290 align:start position:0%
would you believe that as a mandatory
reporter

01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
reporter
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
the end the employer of several others
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:18.020 align:start position:0%
dropping a dime on people very seriously
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
and we really agonize about
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
when somebody did fall down versus
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
something else and we take it very
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
seriously and
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
speaking as both a mandatory reporter
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the restraint that you put
 
01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.129 --> 01:47:55.139 align:start position:0%
I started to say war paint but I decided
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of horrible handwriting I
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
will admit that so I've seen worse
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee good morning my name is Keith
 
01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.050 align:start position:0%
committee good morning my name is Keith
kinning

01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
kinning
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm the advocacy director at Waypoint
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
and I sit in opposition to this bill
 
01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:21.169 align:start position:0%
and I sit in opposition to this bill
um

01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:23.540 align:start position:0%
life is about balancing
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
we have a balance here that we're trying
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
to figure out correct we're trying to
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
balance how do we protect children and
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
get people to call in when they think
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
something is wrong versus a law that
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
apparently is being used in some
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
occasions as the representative said as
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
a weapon
 
01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
and so how do we find that balance
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire we are all mandated
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
reporters but most of us don't know what
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect is and so when we see
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
something happening we're we are tasked
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
by the state to call in and Report
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
something and I think what the
 
01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative said and I agree with two
 
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.390 align:start position:0%
representative said and I agree with two
words

01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
um you don't want the law weaponized but
 
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
he's talking about the deterrence that
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
will happen to the people that are
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
making the false claims I would ask you
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
to look at from the point of view of the
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
deterrence that could happen from people
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
that are afraid to call in because they
 
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
are hearing that you can be charged with
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor if you make a false report
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
and so I I guess what I'm saying to you
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
is if we started telephone like we did
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
when we were in fifth grade and we
 
01:49:29.209 --> 01:49:29.219 align:start position:0%
started here with representative
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
Bickford and I talked about the bill and
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
I'd say you have to knowingly make a
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
false claim and you can end up with a
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I bet by the time it got
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
down to representative Seidel probably
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
what people would hear was that if you
 
01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
make a false claim you can be charged
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
with the misdemeanor and that is my fear
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
is that people will start to hesitate
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to calling in rather than
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
just calling in and letting the
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
department decide
 
01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.570 align:start position:0%
department decide
which

01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
um cases should be followed up and which
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be followed up now in this
 
01:50:04.609 --> 01:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
state the vast majority of cases are
 
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
unfounded there are thousands and
 
01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:09.179 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands and thousands of
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
phone calls that happen in the state
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
every year and a relatively few end up
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
as founded cases and so we have decided
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
as a state we're going to err on the
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
side of letting people call in to make
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure that these kids are protected and
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
letting the state go from there
 
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so I guess the one part that I would
 
01:50:31.609 --> 01:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
ask this committee is that if you decide
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
to go forward with this bill I would
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
recommend that you remove the
 
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors if you decide you want to
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
have civil penalties
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
that is that is in in my opinion a far
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
better way to go than people in the
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
community hearing that if they somehow
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
make a false statement and I know the
 
01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
word is knowingly but if people don't
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
understand that and they hesitate we
 
01:50:52.850 --> 01:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
won't have people calling in protecting
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
the children the Civil penalties are
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
tend to be less intimidating than a
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charge would be
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
um but again this is a balancing act and
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I would ask the committee to consider
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
that as we go forward so I'll stop there
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
and see if there are any questions
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
question from the chair is that in those
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
states that have this
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
bill on the books is a law
 
01:51:21.609 --> 01:51:21.619 align:start position:0%
has the number of people calling in
 
01:51:24.530 --> 01:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
significantly plummeted yeah thank you
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the question I can't answer that for
 
01:51:27.770 --> 01:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman but I can look into it
 
01:51:30.169 --> 01:51:30.179 align:start position:0%
for you I can I can look in to see if if
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.169 --> 01:51:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
01:51:41.090 --> 01:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion could could
 
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
um civil action be taken currently
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
or does it have to be put into statute
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
I mean if somebody put a false claim on
 
01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.770 align:start position:0%
I mean if somebody put a false claim on
me

01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
could I simply go after that person I
 
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
guess thank you for the question I
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want I wouldn't want you to
 
01:51:57.649 --> 01:51:57.659 align:start position:0%
hang your hat on this representative
 
01:51:59.090 --> 01:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
along but I mean it would seem to me
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
that if you're continually being told
 
01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
someone is saying something negative
 
01:52:04.129 --> 01:52:04.139 align:start position:0%
about you that is false that's a
 
01:52:06.290 --> 01:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
defamation under the law so I guess
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
under civil penalty you could do that
 
01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:12.830 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:17.159 --> 01:52:18.290 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
if I was to go to the police and make a
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
false statement I would I would be
 
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
charged if I went to the court I'd be
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
charged however
 
01:52:28.370 --> 01:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
is is there actual immunity
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the statute I I thought there was but
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
I can't remember is there immunity under
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:37.460 align:start position:0%
from people
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
making false statements
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
um or could they be actually charged for
 
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
reporting falsely well thank you for the
 
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
question I don't think currently they
 
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
can be charged I think that the problem
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
becomes is most of us don't know what
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
the definition we don't know the legal
 
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse and neglect I think
 
01:52:59.209 --> 01:52:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford this is what I'm
 
01:53:01.729 --> 01:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
afraid of is that one day you see a
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
child standing out waiting for the bus
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
and they're standing in the rain and you
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
and you call in and nothing happens do
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
you mind if I continue or do you want I
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand that I
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
I was here when we fought when we passed
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
this yeah do you mind if I continue let
 
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
him continue please is that right well
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
and you call in and nothing is done and
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
then you call it and see in a week the
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
child is standing out there and they're
 
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
standing in the rain and they don't have
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
any coat on and then you call in and
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
then the next week you say them standing
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
out in the rain now all of those may
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
have been found unfounded by the
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
department at that point but if you're
 
01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
calling in multiple multiple times
 
01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
because you're seeing things that are
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
happening and this is what usually
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
happens with somebody that's a neighbor
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
um are you going to be at some point is
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
somebody going to say to you well you've
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
made multiple phone calls in here
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
there's never been a founded case and so
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
we can we think what you're doing at
 
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
this point is knowingly making false
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
statements and I think that's what I'm
 
01:53:55.490 --> 01:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
fearful of is that people will start to
 
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:58.139 align:start position:0%
hesitate as they see accumulated data if
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
nothing's happening that could be the
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
fourth or fifth or sixth call and we we
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
have seen this on multiple occasions you
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
know I mean
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
people call in things don't happen
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
people don't and then finally the
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
child's arm is broken or something
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
happens along those lines and if your
 
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
first first thought is I'm going to get
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
into trouble
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to hesitate your first
 
01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:21.659 align:start position:0%
thought should be under our law
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
I got to protect this kid and so again
 
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm fearful that with the
 
01:54:29.209 --> 01:54:29.219 align:start position:0%
public not understowing what knowingly
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
false statement means you may have
 
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
people hesitating to protect a child and
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
then what's the cost of that and that
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
takes us back to the balancing what is
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing nothing what is the
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
cost of doing something along these
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
lines which may deter people on one end
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
for making false statements but also May
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
deter people from calling in
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's not my decision to make that's
 
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
your decision to make as a committee I
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
just want to make you aware of it and I
 
01:54:54.649 --> 01:54:54.659 align:start position:0%
think particularly the criminal
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges could be very
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
significant in deterring people from
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
calling in and and and protecting a
 
01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.149 align:start position:0%
calling in and and and protecting a
child

01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
to what degree are you familiar with how
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
much the uh principle of intent is in
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
play here
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
knowingly make a false statement would
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
you expand on intent as perhaps putting
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
the brakes on rampant run awake uh fear
 
01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
well in 10 is just such an important
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
part of criminal law
 
01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
um you know you can be pulled over by
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
your car and you don't have to be
 
01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
intending the speeding and you can get a
 
01:55:27.649 --> 01:55:27.659 align:start position:0%
ticket that's a part of the law you
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
don't have to show intent most most
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
criminal laws there has to be intent to
 
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
do something
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
um and but again I think representative
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm going back to is first of all
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be asking the CPS WS to
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
make a determination or that they
 
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
thought that those statements were made
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
in good faith and then my question comes
 
01:55:49.370 --> 01:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
back again is if a person is making
 
01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
multiple reports with good intent but
 
01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
the pattern looks like they're trying to
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
harass someone how do you determine that
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
or not and so that's what I was talking
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
about the telephone game which is by the
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
time it would get down to the end here
 
01:56:03.950 --> 01:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid what people are going to hear
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
is if you make a false statement you
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
could be charged with a misdemeanor and
 
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
that would cause people to to hesitate
 
01:56:13.010 --> 01:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
so that that is my concern also you
 
01:56:15.290 --> 01:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
earlier said you were searching for a
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
definition of child abuse as it
 
01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
appertains to this
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
I thank you for the question I don't
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
remember saying that okay I'm saying
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
most people don't know if you stopped
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
100 people on the street I don't think
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
the majority of them would know what
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect is most people in the
 
01:56:32.209 --> 01:56:32.219 align:start position:0%
state know that they're mandated
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
reporters and so the system is set up so
 
01:56:37.729 --> 01:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
that if you think if in your definition
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
in your opinion you think abuse and
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
neglect is happening you call into dcyf
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's what the the point I was trying
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay because it is defined in statute
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
yes no I'm saying the public I see I
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
would say that if there are over 10 000
 
01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
phone calls a year that are made on
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect into dcyf the vast
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
majority of those people probably don't
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
know what the legal definition of abuse
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
and neglect is but they think they know
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
that they're they know their mandated
 
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
reporters most people in the state know
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
this and so they default to calling in
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
early rather than waiting too long
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
that that was my point
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answered your
 
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman or not I think so
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I was going to do a follow-up
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
with you got ahead of me oh I'm
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford for a follow-up
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
our uh researcher has athlete and
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
quickly pointed out to me that
 
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
um 169 C colon 31 immunity for my
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
ability and it says it it's pursuant to
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
a good faith report not any report but a
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
good faith report so my question had
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
been about knowingly uh false statement
 
01:57:51.169 --> 01:57:51.179 align:start position:0%
not about the child with a without a
 
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
code being reported that's a good faith
 
01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:54.830 align:start position:0%
code being reported that's a good faith
report

01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
so the concern of the people brought
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
this bill for it I would say was
 
01:58:03.410 --> 01:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
knowingly that somebody is abusing the
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
system the abuse system and what can
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah as I said and I don't thank you for
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
the question Mr Bickford I I represent
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
blickford I really do think that people
 
01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:21.900 align:start position:0%
that are using this law to bludgeon a
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
spouse or an ex-spouse or
 
01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
um a neighbor is just completely
 
01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:27.709 align:start position:0%
um a neighbor is just completely
incorrect

01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:30.380 align:start position:0%
um I would ask again that the committee
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
weigh the advantage of people not
 
01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
hesitating to call in versus people
 
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
hesitating to call in afraid they're
 
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to be charged with the misdemeanor
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why I would recommend that if
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
you're going to go forward with
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
something like this that you at least
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
take the misdemeanor part out and you
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
saying no further questions thank you
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you chair calls
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
Vivian Gerard and she is promising me
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
two minutes she was up to three at one
 
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:00.380 align:start position:0%
point and wonderfully
 
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
overs wrote it for two minutes let's see
 
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
if you can do it so I was trying to
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
respect that I appreciate that I'm
 
01:59:11.209 --> 01:59:11.219 align:start position:0%
talkative too so thank you
 
01:59:11.219 --> 01:59:12.470 align:start position:0%
talkative too so thank you
um

01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
to the committee for having me up here
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
again again my name is Vivian Gerard I
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
actually have a 14 and a 16 year old
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
daughter so this bill actually
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
um really says a lot about my case uh
 
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
but during my divorce in 2014 the court
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
ordered a gal
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
um and the gal actually tried to pull my
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
children away from me because of a false
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
police report
 
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
Divorced with or without children as
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
everybody knows is very stressful
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
anyways uh the gal has many influences
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
on the future of our children and is
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in many cases the gal did
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
not check out any of the evidence in my
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
case and it didn't even come from any
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
credible sources change the outcome of
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
the case when Child Services came out
 
01:59:59.930 --> 01:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
everything was unfounded and to be
 
02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
honest with you I agree to a certain
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
degree with this bill that
 
02:00:06.410 --> 02:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative spleen had put together
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it needs some amendments to
 
02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:10.129 align:start position:0%
but I think it needs some amendments to
it

02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I felt that it was very biased and we
 
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
did not have equal visits with the gal
 
02:00:17.689 --> 02:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
no one was looking into the false police
 
02:00:20.810 --> 02:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
reports the fees that should have gone
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
into like an account with the Jal they
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
because the gal knows who's paying a
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
pers it sways One Direction or the other
 
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
with the parent so if the person that's
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
paying more the other parent is in a
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
disadvantage we could not speak up until
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
the case was closed and by then it's too
 
02:00:45.410 --> 02:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
late you lose your children
 
02:00:47.689 --> 02:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
um I was accused of child neglect
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
and an investigation was done in based
 
02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:53.300 align:start position:0%
on the plant claims from the undisclosed
 
02:00:56.209 --> 02:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
undisclosed confidential reporter my
 
02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:57.659 align:start position:0%
case was
 
02:01:02.890 --> 02:01:02.900 align:start position:0%
um all to avoid child support from my ex
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
undisclosed individuals can have
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
profound effects on your case without
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
the accused ever having the opportunity
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
to defend against it there is no
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
consequences or recourse so I'm kind of
 
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
glad that this bill is in place the
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
problem I have is it keeps saying you
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
may have consequences
 
02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:24.649 align:start position:0%
may have consequences
um

02:01:24.649 --> 02:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the undisclosed person can
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
essentially give free will to someone to
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
taint an entire parenting case
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
and it's usually simply over money
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
um and to be honest with you
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
um in my case I was fortunate that I did
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
not have these outcomes but I did have a
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
false police report against me I did
 
02:01:48.729 --> 02:01:48.739 align:start position:0%
have child neglect
 
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
complaints against Me based on medical
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
um because I couldn't afford all the
 
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
co-pays to take my child to the doctors
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
they came in and they did well checks
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
children could they said because it was
 
02:02:04.250 --> 02:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
so many the children could it could not
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
even be left upstairs in their room at
 
02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:08.820 align:start position:0%
five and seven years old time to bring
 
02:02:11.089 --> 02:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
it to a close apps absolutely and I I
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
their jobs then other people would not
 
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
be putting in these false claims so if a
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
mandated reporter actually saw that
 
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
there was mental abuse there was child
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
abuse or anything else these mandators
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
would probably have more weight on a
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
false police report or a false report in
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
general thank you so much will you take
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
a question or two if there is any I
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't see any so thank you so much okay
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
put this out in
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman good morning
 
02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me I will
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
try to stick to five minutes nice to see
 
02:03:26.209 --> 02:03:26.219 align:start position:0%
friendly faces here
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
I am a mother I'm here to testify in
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
favor of house bill 108. I am an I.T
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
professional I deal in IIT but also
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
process Improvement a mother of three
 
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
with autism one has a serious neural
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
immune condition we are the type of
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
family that led me to become an advocate
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
in a state I'm not paid I'm a volunteer
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
at a little time I have at night I'm on
 
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
Facebook and I'm trying to help people
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
in support groups so I represent an army
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
of people behind me
 
02:03:55.199 --> 02:03:56.209 align:start position:0%
of people behind me
um

02:03:56.209 --> 02:03:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
when you live the life of a family of
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
children with complex needs and we have
 
02:04:02.209 --> 02:04:02.219 align:start position:0%
a lot in this state we have kids 36 000
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
plus with an IEP in the state you find
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
yourself in the crosshairs of a lot of
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
different things one is that you start
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
to struggle right your family struggles
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
many of us end up in divorce this Brave
 
02:04:15.290 --> 02:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
young lady behind me I commend her for
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
her story mine is very similar to that
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
and what led me here today
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
there's no place to go for resolution
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
the courts in the jail didn't care in
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
our case either and they side with one
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
party they look at who has the money
 
02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
it's a very upside down situation and
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
all of what you think is true that you
 
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
go to Great Lengths to document suddenly
 
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
turns into a report that's completely
 
02:04:38.109 --> 02:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
the opposite
 
02:04:40.729 --> 02:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
and so one side uses the process as a
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
weapon for us it happened twice in the
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
case so when I hear things like these
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
are not good faith reports these people
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
are making these they know that they
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
have to be made in good faith I mean
 
02:04:52.609 --> 02:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
this is stated if anyone reads up on
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
these kind of complaints they must be
 
02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
made in good faith so this the the
 
02:04:59.089 --> 02:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
people that do this that calling these
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
complaints are often obvious repeated
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
complaints they are done knowingly to
 
02:05:05.689 --> 02:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
cause harm
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
and harass so in our case schools and
 
02:05:10.609 --> 02:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
neighbors someone who doesn't like you
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
use it as a weapon for us two or three
 
02:05:16.370 --> 02:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
times it was that happened to us
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not here to tell my story
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
it's really long and I have a book in
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
the process but um I'm only here to say
 
02:05:24.050 --> 02:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
that you know other oftentimes last year
 
02:05:25.490 --> 02:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
we came and we testified in people so
 
02:05:27.530 --> 02:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's a terrible story you know I'm
 
02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
really sorry that happened to you but I
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
can tell you I'm not alone again the
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
Army is behind me and they're all
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
working hard today and they couldn't be
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
here but they know about this and
 
02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
they're behind it
 
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
um these are examples of families that
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
are the most at risk the people who need
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
our intelligent care and support the
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
most like mine when you inform the
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
school nurse after months about your
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
child getting a surgery that was
 
02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
discussed with the IEP team and they
 
02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
turn around and they get snippy and they
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
decide to call it in because you inform
 
02:05:56.089 --> 02:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
them the surgery is next week and the
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
child be out of school there's an
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
example right there a completely
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
malicious complaint
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
or you're dealing with IEP struggles and
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
someone decides oh you don't like the
 
02:06:06.649 --> 02:06:06.659 align:start position:0%
tutor we gave you okay we're going to
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
call in a complaint your kids look
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
unkempt no basis right
 
02:06:12.830 --> 02:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
um you're in a divorce they call in
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
complaints the ex-girlfriend's nudging
 
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
the ex husband to calling it complaint
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know you can get away with this I
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
have people that are up there in Concord
 
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'm connected with in our case that's
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
really the fact
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
and all of these are unfounded what
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
meanwhile you're trying to complex
 
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're trying to deal with what this
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
lady was saying you're trying to keep
 
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
your head above water you're trying to
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
pay all the bills you're trying to keep
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
your kids healthy go to school fight the
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
IEP battles in my case try to keep one
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
alive and literally sitting in a
 
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
hospital room getting a phone call with
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
my child's near death and they're saying
 
02:06:44.209 --> 02:06:44.219 align:start position:0%
the school nurse called this in because
 
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
you sent an email proactively telling
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
her your child will be out of school
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
next week
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
because she thought she needed medical
 
02:06:52.609 --> 02:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
records which is not her right to ask
 
02:06:54.890 --> 02:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
for so you're guilty until you're proven
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
innocent you're accused of actually
 
02:06:58.850 --> 02:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
helping your child in many of these
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
unfounded cases other states that we
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
talked about have a warning as we know
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is built upon and
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
the funding what I'm getting to here is
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
that why process is important is because
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
last year we sat here gave the same
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
testimony commissioner rib shim was here
 
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
he was actually seemingly in favor of
 
02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
this that we need to do something
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
process Improvement costs nothing
 
02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
adding more staff isn't going to fix
 
02:07:21.659 --> 02:07:22.550 align:start position:0%
adding more staff isn't going to fix
this

02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:25.129 --> 02:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
so you know when you look at Family Law
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
you look at the other things that came
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
about criminal law you perjure yourself
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
there's a consequence there is
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely no consequence here for this
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
giant catch-all in a day and age where
 
02:07:37.070 --> 02:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're telling everybody out there to see
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
something say something people get their
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
15 minutes of fame or they use it as a
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
way to hurt each other in a very real
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
and obvious way these are not the not in
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
good faith case these are these are
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely done and they know what
 
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:51.260 align:start position:0%
they're doing when they make those calls
 
02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
the price that we're paying for this is
 
02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
is it's actually Priceless so it's the
 
02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
cases like little Adam little Harmony we
 
02:08:02.209 --> 02:08:02.219 align:start position:0%
don't have the right process in place to
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
catch those situations but yet we can
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
catch people that are actually good
 
02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
upstanding citizens and put them to the
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
point where the parent feels like
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have a heart attack over
 
02:08:12.050 --> 02:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
the stress they're going through because
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
they're trying to save a child's life
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
and then they have this on top of that
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
that is why I'm here and so as far as
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
people saying it's not my decision to
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
make you know we don't we worry about
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
missing somebody there are processes
 
02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
there are laws in place today for that
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
um these are people that don't care they
 
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't care about the law they're doing
 
02:08:32.570 --> 02:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
it regardless and they're going to do it
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
whether in Family Court they could be
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
guilty of perjury they're still going to
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
do it so there needs to be some teeth
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm asking for you to do
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
is put some teeth out there and don't
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
make this one big catch-all because the
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
process is not going to correct that
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's going to hurt people like us people
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
behind me and the harmonies and the
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
other kids get missed all the time and
 
02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'm representing this as a child of a
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
caseworker so I know a little bit of
 
02:08:58.070 --> 02:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about I know about
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
process and I know we can make this
 
02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative petrigno
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:09:10.910 --> 02:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question certainly if I heard
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony correctly I think I heard
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
you say that schools and neighbors use
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
it as a weapon and I think you made
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
reference to a nurse using um this as to
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
make malicious complaints absolutely
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to know if this you think is
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
a a pattern something that happens
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
frequently and if you think that nurses
 
02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
as medical professionals are seeing it
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
that they're doing their due diligence
 
02:09:42.169 --> 02:09:42.179 align:start position:0%
thank you it's a good question it's
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
complex and it varies case to case I
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
think you know in our case the school
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
situation was an obvious one
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
um you know when you are dealing with
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
children getting an IEP and you're
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get supports and services
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're not always the best friend of
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
everybody on the team and in her case
 
02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's a Personnel issue and that should
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
have been dealt with by the school I
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
tried to do that but
 
02:10:03.050 --> 02:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
they got very angry with me for even
 
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
suggesting could have been it was very
 
02:10:06.169 --> 02:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
obvious the person that it was and
 
02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
you'll see these things redacted or
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
blacked out you can tell if you're a
 
02:10:10.490 --> 02:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
smart enough person by reading the
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
Records who did it and I do think
 
02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
there's a pattern with certain people in
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
her case if I was in charge of her I'd
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
be looking into has she done this in
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
other cases there's a fine line you know
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
where she's crossed between it being
 
02:10:25.089 --> 02:10:25.099 align:start position:0%
um her her mandatory reporting
 
02:10:28.550 --> 02:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility and her being for lack of
 
02:10:29.930 --> 02:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for any Karen's in the world
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
in the room a Karen and she's going up
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
Way Beyond her scope and she's using it
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
to hurt somebody
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if that hits your
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
true question but each case can be a
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
little bit different I do think there
 
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
should be mandatory reporters I mean I
 
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
consider myself if I look around I've
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
sat in a parking lot and wondered about
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
a child who's crying and I sat there and
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
kind of observed and I thought you know
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
I don't have all the pieces to this
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
situation so I'm going to make the right
 
02:10:55.729 --> 02:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
choice I'm not going to do anything but
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know if I see that again maybe I'll
 
02:11:00.169 --> 02:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
ask I'll ask a question as a citizen I
 
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
talk to the parent you know but I'm not
 
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to make that jump to conclusions
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a way it can be done
 
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers everything
 
02:11:12.229 --> 02:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
you are looking for any additional
 
02:11:12.239 --> 02:11:15.890 align:start position:0%
you are looking for any additional
questions

02:11:15.890 --> 02:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to
 
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
um the chairman and vice chairman that
 
02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
we're not ready to proceed to a vote on
 
02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:38.629 align:start position:0%
we're not ready to proceed to a vote on
this

02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:11:38.639 --> 02:11:39.709 align:start position:0%
this
um

02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
so we will be adjourning the hearing
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
and taking it up at a later date
 
02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.490 align:start position:0%
and taking it up at a later date
um

02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
we are adjourned to one o'clock
 
02:11:57.290 --> 02:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
and I might suggest this I gotta run
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
over next door but it might be a good
 
02:12:02.689 --> 02:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
time if people would uh like to have
 
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
lunch with people you don't know you
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
know form some uh
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
interparty bonds and so on but we're
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
back at one o'clock
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
welcome to CFL if you think this is the
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
Canadian Football League you are in the
 
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
wrong room this is actually uh What's
 
03:31:54.889 --> 03:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
this called children and family law and
 
03:31:58.250 --> 03:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
I opened the hearing on House Bill 151 a
 
03:32:01.370 --> 03:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee now before I
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
read any further there is a word that
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
comes down from the Enchanted Forest
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
that says Kell they don't like
 
03:32:15.410 --> 03:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
committees so I suggest that is not the
 
03:32:16.969 --> 03:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
11th commandment thou shall not
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee but instead it could be a good
 
03:32:22.210 --> 03:32:22.220 align:start position:0%
vehicle to get
 
03:32:22.220 --> 03:32:23.769 align:start position:0%
vehicle to get
intelligent

03:32:23.769 --> 03:32:23.779 align:start position:0%
intelligent
 
03:32:27.950 --> 03:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
ideas floated and policies and so on so
 
03:32:30.769 --> 03:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
the compromise was Pearson you round up
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
the people who will be appointed to
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
these things what they didn't know is I
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
love it but my little hook on this is
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
with the consultation of the Bill's
 
03:32:45.050 --> 03:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor so together should this
 
03:32:48.530 --> 03:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
bill ever get signed into law we will
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
have our people already lined up it's a
 
03:32:51.359 --> 03:32:53.389 align:start position:0%
have our people already lined up it's a
deal

03:32:53.389 --> 03:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
deal
 
03:32:55.150 --> 03:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
good you don't have any choice
 
03:32:57.650 --> 03:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
03:33:01.670 --> 03:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
issue of unmarried cohabitants domestic
 
03:33:04.510 --> 03:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and common law marriage
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%

03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
body and two in the two previous
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions in 2020 SB 602
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
was voted ought to pass from the Senate
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee with a unanimous 6-0
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
vote it subsequently died a coveted
 
03:34:17.809 --> 03:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
death in the house in 2022 SB 291
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
was voted ought to pass in the Senate
 
03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
Judiciary again with the unanimous 5-0
 
03:34:24.050 --> 03:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
vote that year the vote out of the house
 
03:34:25.550 --> 03:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
 
03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
Committee was inexpedient to legislate
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
by a 12-8 vote the bill died in the
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
house on the floor by a vote of 179 to
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
143. one of the reasons I for the itl
 
03:34:39.710 --> 03:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
might have been as the chair has just
 
03:34:41.690 --> 03:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
said a caution against a multitude of
 
03:34:44.769 --> 03:34:44.779 align:start position:0%
study committees and I certainly respect
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the continued caution on study
 
03:34:51.050 --> 03:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
committees and therefore I say Mr chair
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
members of this committee that the
 
03:34:55.250 --> 03:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on this bill Representatives
 
03:34:59.450 --> 03:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
Murray Balboni as well as Senator Waters
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
and I are already willing and able to
 
03:35:03.410 --> 03:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
commit to the work of completing the
 
03:35:05.690 --> 03:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
study of this issue should we be
 
03:35:08.090 --> 03:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
appointed and I do know that all the
 
03:35:09.530 --> 03:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
representatives and Senators that I've
 
03:35:11.570 --> 03:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
named have said they are willing to go
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
do the work we might need to find a
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
Republican or two as well
 
03:35:18.250 --> 03:35:18.260 align:start position:0%
duly noted
 
03:35:22.010 --> 03:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
duly noted so I am asking for not to
 
03:35:24.889 --> 03:35:24.899 align:start position:0%
pass on this bill the majority of U.S
 
03:35:26.690 --> 03:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
states draw a sharp legal line between
 
03:35:28.849 --> 03:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
cohabitation and marriage attaching
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
clear and important rights benefits and
 
03:35:34.250 --> 03:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the latter but few
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
if any to the former
 
03:35:37.729 --> 03:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
common law marriage is formally
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
recognized in just eight states Colorado
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
Iowa Kansas Montana South Carolina Texas
 
03:35:46.010 --> 03:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
Utah end our great state of New
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a common law marriage is a
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
legally recognized Union between two
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%

by a ceremony
 
03:35:58.250 --> 03:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
domestic Partnerships recognize the
 
03:36:00.650 --> 03:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
union of two people but differ from a
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
common law marriage in that the domestic
 
03:36:06.170 --> 03:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
partnership is a union moving forward
 
03:36:08.690 --> 03:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
effective from this day for instance
 
03:36:11.210 --> 03:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
while a common law marriage is more
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
commonly retroactive we recognize the
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
partnership as a result of time
 
03:36:19.130 --> 03:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
unmarried cohabitants live under the
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
same roof
 
03:36:23.090 --> 03:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
there is a common law marriage exception
 
03:36:25.729 --> 03:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire under RSA Force excuse
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
me 457 colon 39 which gives a spouse
 
03:36:31.490 --> 03:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
share of the estate of a deceased common
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
law spouse but for the exception to be
 
03:36:37.370 --> 03:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
valid the couple must cohabitate
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
that is live under the same roof for and
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
acknowledge each other as husband and
 
03:36:44.450 --> 03:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
wife for a period of three years that's
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
an important distinction you will hear
 
03:36:48.889 --> 03:36:48.899 align:start position:0%
testimony today the devastation that can
 
03:36:51.170 --> 03:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
occur when a couple is for all intents
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
and purpose in a common law marriage yet
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
gaps and silence in state law render
 
03:36:58.490 --> 03:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
surviving members of the relationship
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
helpless in the wake of life-changing
 
03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:02.819 align:start position:0%
events if two people are in a committed
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
relationship they might be expected to
 
03:37:05.279 --> 03:37:06.410 align:start position:0%
relationship they might be expected to
contract

03:37:06.410 --> 03:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:37:09.349 --> 03:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is some of the argument that was
 
03:37:11.210 --> 03:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
made in the last session
 
03:37:13.849 --> 03:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
a legal marriage creates a reciprocal
 
03:37:15.650 --> 03:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
contract between spouses including
 
03:37:17.030 --> 03:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
benefits of an estate and
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for care upon death and
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
we commonly call this type of contract a
 
03:37:21.720 --> 03:37:22.969 align:start position:0%
we commonly call this type of contract a
will

03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:37:25.729 --> 03:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
in a recent Gallup poll oh my nose is
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
running can I borrow tissue for a second
 
03:37:29.870 --> 03:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
03:37:32.330 --> 03:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
for health reasons it has to be a gift
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Okay I accept the gift
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
in a recent Gallup poll only 46 percent
 
03:37:46.190 --> 03:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
of married couples have a will
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
results have been similar in three other
 
03:37:51.410 --> 03:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
polls on the same question since 1990.
 
03:37:53.570 --> 03:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
we cannot assume all the reasons why a
 
03:37:55.490 --> 03:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
couple will not create a will but we can
 
03:37:57.710 --> 03:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
be sure that committed couples both
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
married and those unmarried and domestic
 
03:38:02.090 --> 03:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and common law marriages
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
may put themselves at some risk
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
a study published by the Pew Research
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
Center discovered that more adults in
 
03:38:10.849 --> 03:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
our country are delaying or even
 
03:38:13.330 --> 03:38:13.340 align:start position:0%
foregoing marriage altogether between
 
03:38:16.849 --> 03:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
1995 and the time of the study in 2019
 
03:38:19.370 --> 03:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
the share of adults who were legally
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
married declined slightly from 58
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
percent to 53 percent
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
yet over that same period the share of
 
03:38:27.650 --> 03:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
adults who were living in an unmarried
 
03:38:29.750 --> 03:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me living with an unmarried
 
03:38:32.090 --> 03:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
partner more than doubled rising from
 
03:38:34.190 --> 03:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
three percent to seven percent
 
03:38:36.290 --> 03:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
according to U.S census data the U.S
 
03:38:38.809 --> 03:38:38.819 align:start position:0%
marriage rate hit an all-time low in
 
03:38:41.389 --> 03:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
that same year of 2019. for every one
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
thousand unmarried adults in 2019 only
 
03:38:47.630 --> 03:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
33 got married this number was 35 in
 
03:38:53.929 --> 03:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
2020 excuse me 2010 and 86 in 1970 this
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
decline in marriages and rise in
 
03:38:57.050 --> 03:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
cohabitation might pull us into a
 
03:38:59.389 --> 03:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
conversation about morality and the
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
sanctity of marriage it is very possible
 
03:39:04.370 --> 03:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
the lack of law Nationwide on this
 
03:39:07.010 --> 03:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
matter relates to a principled view that
 
03:39:09.950 --> 03:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
marriage creates stability
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is possible that legislators
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide May hold that common law
 
03:39:16.010 --> 03:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
marriages and domestic Partnerships are
 
03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
potentially unstable and susceptible to
 
03:39:19.020 --> 03:39:20.090 align:start position:0%
potentially unstable and susceptible to
fraud

03:39:20.090 --> 03:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
03:39:22.610 --> 03:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
but it is interesting that cohabitation
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
is more likely to function as a
 
03:39:26.570 --> 03:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
substitute for being single
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
not being married and therefore more a
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
function of a loving commitment than
 
03:39:33.290 --> 03:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
rather devoid of it
 
03:39:34.849 --> 03:39:34.859 align:start position:0%

demonstrate the cohabitation common law

marriages and domestic Partnerships can
 
03:39:40.490 --> 03:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
join two very committed people in a
 
03:39:42.650 --> 03:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
loving stable relationship those
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
relationships May produce equally
 
03:39:46.849 --> 03:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
committed loving families there are laws
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
that protect children born into common

law marriages
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
I this study May explore those laws but
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
the focus of the study is more likely to
 
03:39:58.190 --> 03:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
step to Center on the rights and

people in those committed relationship

there is no next of kin or the next of

the deceaseds body

03:40:40.610 --> 03:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
events for which our state law is either
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
silent or where there are gaps I thank

wasn't really clear on that on where
 
03:41:15.650 --> 03:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
we're headed you know
 
03:41:17.570 --> 03:41:17.580 align:start position:0%

03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative and where we're trying to
 
03:41:34.610 --> 03:41:34.620 align:start position:0%
go when this was this issue was first
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention and you'll hear
 
03:41:37.849 --> 03:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
testimony from the person who did that
 
03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
it it presented the what ifs to the
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
legal side of this by the way I have no
 
03:41:48.110 --> 03:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
I I my my I do not get people married I
 
03:41:49.729 --> 03:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
I have no business in that whatsoever
 
03:41:51.530 --> 03:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
this is a constituent that brought this
 
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
up when I entered this room I heard from
 
03:41:57.530 --> 03:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
somebody who had the polar opposite
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh circumstances in their life where
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
they were actually considered
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
cohabitating but the law created such
 
03:42:07.969 --> 03:42:07.979 align:start position:0%
problem there was gray area in the law
 
03:42:10.490 --> 03:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
such that it created legal problems
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this from the legal
 
03:42:15.410 --> 03:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
side of where do people stand now I I
 
03:42:17.690 --> 03:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
won't suppose that I know how exactly to
 
03:42:19.190 --> 03:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
do that yet but we're going to bring in
 
03:42:21.889 --> 03:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
whatever parties are necessary to help
 
03:42:24.530 --> 03:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
us find that gray area and close any
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
gaps in the law so that we can both
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
protect people who are well not both but
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
we can protect people who are in these
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
kind of relationships
 
03:42:32.279 --> 03:42:33.650 align:start position:0%
kind of relationships
you

03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
I I feel you should have brought those
 
03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
fall with those issues or problems that
 
03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:39.830 align:start position:0%
fall with those issues or problems that
you

03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
want solved
 
03:42:45.050 --> 03:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
but due respect I think you'll hear that
 
03:42:47.690 --> 03:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
in the testimony that follows okay sure
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
your advocacy is to set up a study
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
commission and you're you're giving a
 
03:42:56.330 --> 03:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
big overall view of the picture not
 
03:42:58.370 --> 03:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily making any recommendations
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
is that your purpose correct
 
03:43:03.290 --> 03:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chair
 
03:43:03.300 --> 03:43:04.070 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chair
um

03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh and I know words are important I
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
think but would certainly welcome the
 
03:43:11.570 --> 03:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of the committee of
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
this committee that a committee might be
 
03:43:17.330 --> 03:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
better simply because it is smaller and
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
we might have a better chance of being
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
able to bring in the professionals uh
 
03:43:23.809 --> 03:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
who can help us with that if this
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
committee thinks that a larger
 
03:43:28.190 --> 03:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
commission is the better route I'm open
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the wisdom of the folks we don't
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
I I yield not because of the quality of
 
03:43:38.090 --> 03:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
the people here but because a working
 
03:43:41.389 --> 03:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
group that can be mobile I know from
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
experience can get a lot more done a lot
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
quicker than recommendations can come
 
03:43:46.560 --> 03:43:48.469 align:start position:0%
quicker than recommendations can come
back

03:43:48.469 --> 03:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you not because we're not quality
 
03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
thank you not because we're not quality
here

03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.090 --> 03:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes for three minutes
 
03:44:08.809 --> 03:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
Vivian Gerard three minutes she's proven
 
03:44:19.690 --> 03:44:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
there we go well done sorry
 
03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you my name is Vivian Gerard
 
03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I I'm the owner of Timber post bed
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
and breakfast and as many of you heard
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
prior I've been dealing with a really
 
03:44:39.769 --> 03:44:39.779 align:start position:0%
bad nine-year divorce so I'm very very
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
against marriages or the government
 
03:44:44.450 --> 03:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
getting involved in my life they've
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
proven that they've done nothing but
 
03:44:49.969 --> 03:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
caused damage and left damage behind so
 
03:44:52.450 --> 03:44:52.460 align:start position:0%
first I know that you had
 
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
a chair that you had said that you'd
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
like some recommendations and I actually
 
03:44:59.929 --> 03:44:59.939 align:start position:0%
have some along the way that can be
 
03:45:02.150 --> 03:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
handed over to this committee that's
 
03:45:04.130 --> 03:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
going to be established perfect because
 
03:45:06.530 --> 03:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
I could be that rep that Republican that
 
03:45:07.729 --> 03:45:07.739 align:start position:0%
could be on the study if you'd like
 
03:45:07.739 --> 03:45:09.469 align:start position:0%
could be on the study if you'd like
anyways

03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
um part of this is
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
um if somebody was going to get married
 
03:45:16.010 --> 03:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
automatically they go in and apply for a
 
03:45:19.130 --> 03:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
marriage license wouldn't it be kinda a
 
03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
great idea if somebody had an auntie
 
03:45:24.349 --> 03:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
enough where before you get put in the
 
03:45:26.690 --> 03:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
situation education of divorce you
 
03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
already walk in there knowing okay I'm
 
03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
bringing this to the table if something
 
03:45:32.690 --> 03:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
happens I'm taking that back with me or
 
03:45:35.210 --> 03:45:35.220 align:start position:0%
as they get further in their Journey
 
03:45:37.610 --> 03:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
they can add different things and they
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
should go into this as a business
 
03:45:38.880 --> 03:45:40.610 align:start position:0%
should go into this as a business
contract

03:45:40.610 --> 03:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
so when you're working with property or
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be kids at least
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's talked about when you're
 
03:45:50.389 --> 03:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
level-headed and not when it becomes a
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
big contested divorce
 
03:45:53.279 --> 03:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
big contested divorce
so

03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:55.500 --> 03:45:56.990 align:start position:0%
so
everyone

03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
03:45:59.929 --> 03:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
um as I said should should be that goes
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
in for a marriage license should be
 
03:46:06.050 --> 03:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
forced to take a pre-marriage class so
 
03:46:08.510 --> 03:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know as any other contract you know
 
03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
what you're going into this contract
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
what you could lose and what can change
 
03:46:16.670 --> 03:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
the way life is now
 
03:46:18.769 --> 03:46:18.779 align:start position:0%
um they don't communicate
 
03:46:22.190 --> 03:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
the the parts of divorce that will
 
03:46:24.170 --> 03:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
affect your life in this way
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the government's role is to help
 
03:46:28.729 --> 03:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
protect parties with the Health and
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
Welfare not to really sit there and
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
divide their assets up of unmarried
 
03:46:35.990 --> 03:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
parties may I suggest we're getting
 
03:46:38.090 --> 03:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
somewhat off topic this sounds like an
 
03:46:40.370 --> 03:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
opening Salvo for the committee when it
 
03:46:42.769 --> 03:46:42.779 align:start position:0%
meets we are here to speak to the merits
 
03:46:44.570 --> 03:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
or not merits of establishing a
 
03:46:46.969 --> 03:46:46.979 align:start position:0%
committee well and so can you make that
 
03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
point so so the point that I'm trying to
 
03:46:53.090 --> 03:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
make is being somebody of divorce I know
 
03:46:57.710 --> 03:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
what is affected personally in in my
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
experience so having this study
 
03:47:03.050 --> 03:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
certainly helps bring other parts of
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
this to
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
the government here and if somebody has
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
a single status they should be able to
 
03:47:13.010 --> 03:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
remain single and one last thing that I
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
want to touch upon
 
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
um in in my experience because I do rent
 
03:47:21.290 --> 03:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
out rooms in my situation
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
I lost alimony by having a renter and
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
even though I had a rental agreement the
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
judge waived the role and decided that
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
she was going to make up her own
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
decision on it so whether I you have

somebody in three years living with you
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
you might enter into a contract that you
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
don't even know that you've entered a
 
03:47:46.429 --> 03:47:46.439 align:start position:0%

03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
for today in brief I'm here
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
at the story of two people who lived Our
 
03:49:34.010 --> 03:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
Lives as husband and wife
 
03:49:36.889 --> 03:49:36.899 align:start position:0%
on October 27th of 2021 I got a phone
 
03:49:38.570 --> 03:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
call that Mark had gone into cardiac
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
arrest in my driveway
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
upon arriving to the hospital I was told
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
that he was on life support and they
 
03:49:46.849 --> 03:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
needed to take him off and it was my
 
03:49:48.889 --> 03:49:48.899 align:start position:0%
decision to do so would I please come in
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and do that I did
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
in the meantime I called his two
 
03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
estranged brothers so he hadn't seen in
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
well over 10 years or spoken with very
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
much except for when his mom got cancer
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
in 2018.
 
03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
the two of them showed up after I spent
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
some time with the medical examiner
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
about 30 minutes answering questions
 
03:50:09.290 --> 03:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
about Mark's life in our life together
 
03:50:11.809 --> 03:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
once those Brothers showed up I no
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
longer had rights the medical examiner
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
turned his back to me he only addressed
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
those brothers who came out of the
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
woodwork and I could make no further
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
decisions for Mark
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
they were asked what Mark's final wishes
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
were and they had to let them know he
 
03:50:27.889 --> 03:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
wished to be cremated
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't know they didn't have an
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
answer for him they were asked is he an
 
03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
organ donor they said I don't know and
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
our friend a priest who was with me said
 
03:50:37.849 --> 03:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
yes he is and we have his license to
 
03:50:39.290 --> 03:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
show it
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
the medical examiner continued to
 
03:50:42.530 --> 03:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
address these two brothers who hadn't
 
03:50:44.090 --> 03:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
been around in all these years and knew
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
nothing and I know longer mattered
 
03:50:50.929 --> 03:50:50.939 align:start position:0%
so from there we left we went back into
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
the room spent some time with Mark the
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
brothers left our friend who's a priest
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
spent some time with Mark and we left
 
03:50:58.190 --> 03:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
03:51:00.710 --> 03:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
that night I got a phone call from the
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
Oregon bank that the brothers had signed
 
03:51:04.610 --> 03:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
his body over to me they wanted no part
 
03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
of his organ donation or his burial
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
so from there I took care of the organ
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
donation I called their brother his
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
brother in the morning and said I need
 
03:51:14.450 --> 03:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
to go to the funeral home would one of
 
03:51:15.889 --> 03:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
you be willing to come with me they said
 
03:51:15.899 --> 03:51:16.790 align:start position:0%
you be willing to come with me they said
no

03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:51:19.250 --> 03:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
upon arriving to the funeral home I was
 
03:51:21.410 --> 03:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
told because we weren't married I really
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
didn't have a right to bury him if he
 
03:51:26.450 --> 03:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
has next of kin I have no rights so
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
after a long talk with the funeral home
 
03:51:30.650 --> 03:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
he was able to come up with a law that
 
03:51:33.889 --> 03:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
covered abandonment and estrangement to
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
allow me to give him a proper burial
 
03:51:38.929 --> 03:51:38.939 align:start position:0%
from near ASAP Council because I didn't
 
03:51:41.210 --> 03:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
know what to do what are my rights we
 
03:51:43.010 --> 03:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
aren't married and do these brothers
 
03:51:45.050 --> 03:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
have rights to everything and apparently
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
they did our businesses our bed our
 
03:51:51.290 --> 03:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
everything had to be turned over
 
03:51:53.570 --> 03:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
and so I asked if we can have this
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
conversation can we find those great
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
areas because I don't believe I'm alone
 
03:52:00.050 --> 03:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'm an assistant town clerk for the town
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
of Hampton and I can tell you two
 
03:52:04.190 --> 03:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
stories of exactly what happened to me
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
happened to others one was a 25 year old
 
03:52:08.929 --> 03:52:08.939 align:start position:0%
girl driving to New Jersey to get
 
03:52:08.939 --> 03:52:09.950 align:start position:0%
girl driving to New Jersey to get
married

03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
married
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
and her fiancee was killed in the car
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
with her and her baby her and her baby
 
03:52:16.250 --> 03:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
came in our office to register a car and
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
she couldn't because his name was on the
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
title she didn't even have a right in
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to get a
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
death certificate she's the mother of
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
his child and she can't get a death
 
03:52:27.410 --> 03:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
certificate in the state of New
 
03:52:27.420 --> 03:52:28.490 align:start position:0%
certificate in the state of New
Hampshire

03:52:28.490 --> 03:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
there are far too many of these stories
 
03:52:33.290 --> 03:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
far too many that I think we at least
 
03:52:35.330 --> 03:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
should have the conversation
 
03:52:37.610 --> 03:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
let's find those bright areas and let's
 
03:52:40.250 --> 03:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
help people because I'm not alone and I
 
03:52:42.530 --> 03:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
don't think it's right so I ask you
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
today please to support this Committee
 
03:52:46.729 --> 03:52:46.739 align:start position:0%

03:52:48.530 --> 03:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
03:52:51.170 --> 03:52:51.180 align:start position:0%

your story with us we appreciate that
 
03:52:55.849 --> 03:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
you're right it is more common than one
 
03:52:57.050 --> 03:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
would think
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
close to hearing on House Bill 151 and
 
03:53:18.290 --> 03:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
with the agreement of ranking member I
 
03:53:22.250 --> 03:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
open an exec session on the same bill
 
03:53:25.309 --> 03:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
remember the bill before us
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
is not to make any determinations about
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
changing laws to build before us is to
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
set up a study committee that will bring
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
forward recommendations which at a
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
future date will probably be lsrs that
 
03:53:43.490 --> 03:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
some of us turn in that is what is
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
before us to establish a study committee
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%

03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
the only thing I've seen uh that would
 
03:54:55.250 --> 03:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
be questionable is a common law marriage
 
03:54:56.689 --> 03:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
which doesn't happen until after you're
 
03:54:56.699 --> 03:54:57.769 align:start position:0%
which doesn't happen until after you're
dead

03:54:57.769 --> 03:54:57.779 align:start position:0%
dead
 
03:55:00.410 --> 03:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
after you're dead someone can make a
 
03:55:02.110 --> 03:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
claim that they
 
03:55:05.450 --> 03:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh lied about your situation
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
and claimed that they were married to
 
03:55:08.809 --> 03:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
you and then they can go after your
 
03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
estate I think that's wrong
 
03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
that that's the only thing I can see
 
03:55:15.530 --> 03:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
that needs to be changed
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
um otherwise the situations uh like the
 
03:55:20.570 --> 03:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
lady that spoke to us
 
03:55:20.580 --> 03:55:21.469 align:start position:0%
lady that spoke to us
um

03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
you could be dating someone and claim
 
03:55:23.520 --> 03:55:25.370 align:start position:0%
you could be dating someone and claim
well

03:55:25.370 --> 03:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:55:27.650 --> 03:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
you know this is my person that I want
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
to take care of but
 
03:55:31.910 --> 03:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
you have to have uh agreements between
 
03:55:34.849 --> 03:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
I take
 
03:55:39.650 --> 03:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
to to try and make some kind of changes
 
03:55:39.660 --> 03:55:40.910 align:start position:0%
to to try and make some kind of changes
I

03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:55:42.290 --> 03:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
um there's just too many of us in this
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
world that want freedom and that my
 
03:55:46.370 --> 03:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
having people try to stuff
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh marriage down our throats
 
03:55:50.880 --> 03:55:51.590 align:start position:0%
uh marriage down our throats
um

03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
I know it's kind of strong language
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
03:55:57.650 --> 03:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
I'm not married I've never been married
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I've been with the same woman 35
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
years so I'm more successful than most
 
03:56:02.689 --> 03:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
people that have been married
 
03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to be married
 
03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
we like what the agreements that we've
 
03:56:10.010 --> 03:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
made we don't want to go to court like
 
03:56:10.020 --> 03:56:11.870 align:start position:0%
made we don't want to go to court like
Miss

03:56:11.870 --> 03:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
03:56:15.530 --> 03:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
Gerard we want to stay out of it
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
and we can do that with our agreements
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm
 
03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm posed because of the direction I
 
03:56:25.130 --> 03:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
believe this is trying to go in
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.269 --> 03:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
I believe this is necessary to be honest
 
03:56:39.050 --> 03:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
especially in a lot of communities this
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
is common common to leave without being
 
03:56:41.520 --> 03:56:42.769 align:start position:0%
is common common to leave without being
married

03:56:42.769 --> 03:56:42.779 align:start position:0%
married
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
but a lot of times
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's no paper saying that you've been
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
living with this person for so many
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
years and then you have the same rights
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
as someone is married and then you can
 
03:56:58.250 --> 03:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I believe this committee will help
 
03:57:04.670 --> 03:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of us to understand the
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
consequences of you know the issue that
 
03:57:09.670 --> 03:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh the test
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
the person who testified just brought up
 
03:57:16.250 --> 03:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
to our attention it happens a lot and I
 
03:57:19.250 --> 03:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
see it happen a lot and especially
 
03:57:19.260 --> 03:57:20.650 align:start position:0%
see it happen a lot and especially
um

03:57:20.650 --> 03:57:20.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:20.660 --> 03:57:22.389 align:start position:0%
um
in

03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:57:25.010 --> 03:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
underrepresented communities
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think it's critical for
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
us to have a study committee on this
 
03:57:32.090 --> 03:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
03:57:34.250 --> 03:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
 
03:57:34.260 --> 03:57:35.870 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
Greg

03:57:35.870 --> 03:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
Greg
 
03:57:37.429 --> 03:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
um unless I'm mistaken I don't think
 
03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
this is trying to shove marriage down
 
03:57:41.929 --> 03:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
people's roads I think it's trying to
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
protect people who have also chosen not
 
03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
to get married it's a conversation
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know that I've heard a lot
 
03:57:50.450 --> 03:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
especially in the times the health
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
concerns that we've had the last few
 
03:57:54.590 --> 03:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
years that have you know seen younger
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
people and you know do we have to be
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
married to have this and and certainly
 
03:58:01.010 --> 03:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know for this last woman that
 
03:58:03.650 --> 03:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
testified it compounded her entire grief
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
situation when family was able to come
 
03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
in and a lot of times we do have family
 
03:58:07.859 --> 03:58:09.769 align:start position:0%
in and a lot of times we do have family
estrangement

03:58:09.769 --> 03:58:09.779 align:start position:0%
estrangement
 
03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think it's more actually
 
03:58:14.809 --> 03:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
protecting a situation like yours you
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
know where you haven't been married for
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
but you've been together 35 years that
 
03:58:21.290 --> 03:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
that Union and what you guys have built
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
should be producted and it shouldn't
 
03:58:25.010 --> 03:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
have to be on
 
03:58:26.450 --> 03:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
um so I think a study figuring out
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
exactly is there a need here because
 
03:58:30.530 --> 03:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
we've now heard you know at least one
 
03:58:32.330 --> 03:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
case where
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:38.689 --> 03:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative anyone else
 
03:58:41.450 --> 03:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
wish to speak representative panic
 
03:58:44.090 --> 03:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
so the way that I'm just looking for
 
03:58:46.250 --> 03:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
some clarification so the way the laws
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
are written now if you're cohabitating
 
03:58:53.450 --> 03:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
um or you're in a common law marriage
 
03:58:58.969 --> 03:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
that if you had your partner pass on and
 
03:59:01.130 --> 03:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
then strange family member can come and
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
take away your house your car is that
 
03:59:09.610 --> 03:59:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.550 --> 03:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
we actually don't ask that question I
 
03:59:14.809 --> 03:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
don't know who I'm supposed to be asking
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
the question to I'm asking you anybody
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the committee who might know yeah
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford do you know well
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's your property I mean it's
 
03:59:23.870 --> 03:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
your house
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
um we own a house together her name on
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
it my name's on it then you make a
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
decision whether it's going to be in
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
common or uh or survivorship
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
um like they all will will give you your
 
03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
rights you don't need anything this
 
03:59:40.670 --> 03:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want somebody I would want to
 
03:59:41.689 --> 03:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
say it
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
um if you want to be married you can be
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
married there's nothing says you can't
 
03:59:46.189 --> 03:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
be married that's what gets me
 
03:59:48.530 --> 03:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get married and that then
 
03:59:50.210 --> 03:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
these problems that you think are going
 
03:59:51.530 --> 03:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
to happen to you are not going to happen
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
to you
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
but I own like I say a lot of property
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
of my own and then we own property
 
03:59:56.760 --> 03:59:58.070 align:start position:0%
of my own and then we own property
together

03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:59:59.870 --> 03:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
with both our names on the property and
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
you'll do that even if you're married
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see it on there but there's
 
04:00:04.130 --> 04:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
throughout Homestead rights that go to
 
04:00:05.809 --> 04:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
married people but we're all aware of
 
04:00:07.250 --> 04:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
those things you know we work with
 
04:00:09.290 --> 04:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
lawyers and we know what our rights are
 
04:00:11.809 --> 04:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
we actually do have rights
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
as single people
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
so this is almost like a prenuptial
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
agreement oh I'm sorry it's different
 
04:00:19.080 --> 04:00:25.790 align:start position:0%
agreement oh I'm sorry it's different
we

04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.429 --> 04:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone please thank you
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a question of the chair
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
if you have access to the common law
 
04:00:37.429 --> 04:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
marriage statute
 
04:00:41.389 --> 04:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't see my committee researcher
 
04:00:47.570 --> 04:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
there do I can take this testimony from
 
04:00:50.450 --> 04:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
someone in the audience if you have that
 
04:00:55.929 --> 04:00:55.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.849 --> 04:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
what was the question I didn't I may Mr
 
04:01:00.650 --> 04:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
chair I just have to go through that's
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
fine I will come back to that question
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.610 --> 04:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the time spent this
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
talks about cohabitation not common law
 
04:01:49.080 --> 04:01:50.150 align:start position:0%
talks about cohabitation not common law
marriage

04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
marriage
 
04:01:51.950 --> 04:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't answer your question
 
04:01:53.809 --> 04:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
particularly I believe that's where it
 
04:01:57.769 --> 04:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.929 --> 04:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
why don't we give you a few minutes to
 
04:02:02.570 --> 04:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
continue to read on and we'll see if
 
04:02:04.990 --> 04:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
there's anybody else who would like to
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
say anything representative Raymond
 
04:02:10.490 --> 04:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so there is no
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
um common law Statute in New Hampshire
 
04:02:17.450 --> 04:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
um if you did a search in the New
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rsas you wouldn't find common
 
04:02:20.809 --> 04:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
law the only thing that's referred to as
 
04:02:20.819 --> 04:02:22.490 align:start position:0%
law the only thing that's referred to as
cohabitation

04:02:22.490 --> 04:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
cohabitation
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
um So currently in New Hampshire since
 
04:02:25.439 --> 04:02:27.769 align:start position:0%
um So currently in New Hampshire since
1842

04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
1842
 
04:02:29.809 --> 04:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
um you have to be married in order to
 
04:02:32.450 --> 04:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
get that automatic death benefit if
 
04:02:34.010 --> 04:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
you're just cohabitating and you don't
 
04:02:36.170 --> 04:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
have a will or a property in both
 
04:02:39.050 --> 04:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
parties names it doesn't go to the other
 
04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
the surviving party so when we have
 
04:02:45.650 --> 04:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
people who are living together in a
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
committed relationship whether they have
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
children or not
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
they are considered two single people
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
residing in the same home they are not
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
considered to be a couple in any legal
 
04:02:58.210 --> 04:02:58.220 align:start position:0%
way in New Hampshire
 
04:03:01.250 --> 04:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
children allows for property to transfer
 
04:03:03.889 --> 04:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
to the children but not to the parent of
 
04:03:07.130 --> 04:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
that child without any other will or
 
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
legal proceeding
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so at this point I don't think that
 
04:03:13.969 --> 04:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
this study is asking us to pass any
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
bills to do any of that to me it sounds
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
like the study is to see who like what's
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
the commonality of
 
04:03:25.849 --> 04:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
um or how common is this practice in New
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is there a need for any
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to address it and I don't
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
think we can address the question of
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not legislation is needed
 
04:03:37.670 --> 04:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
unless we study the issue so for myself
 
04:03:39.950 --> 04:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
I am in favor of studying the issue
 
04:03:41.809 --> 04:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
seeing what the committee comes back
 
04:03:44.769 --> 04:03:44.779 align:start position:0%
with and then at that point
 
04:03:46.849 --> 04:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
discussing through public hearing and
 
04:03:48.889 --> 04:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
and through executive session whether or
 
04:03:52.250 --> 04:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
not any legislation is warranted
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
DeSimone did you find something
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I did and I found
 
04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
what I thought I would find because I I
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
was under the impression that New
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have uh and does not
 
04:04:11.450 --> 04:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
recognize common law marriage uh except
 
04:04:15.229 --> 04:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
extended to the cohabitation issue
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and and that's what I thought and I
 
04:04:19.250 --> 04:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to make a
 
04:04:22.010 --> 04:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't want to vote based on a thought
 
04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to have the actual proof
 
04:04:27.650 --> 04:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
so in this it discusses
 
04:04:30.050 --> 04:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
um common law marriage there is no such
 
04:04:32.809 --> 04:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
thing or a statute in the state of New
 
04:04:32.819 --> 04:04:34.729 align:start position:0%
thing or a statute in the state of New
Hampshire

04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
um so I thank you for indulging me
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
so so do you think a study of this would
 
04:04:41.570 --> 04:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
or warranted at least
 
04:04:47.689 --> 04:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that
 
04:04:47.699 --> 04:04:48.469 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that
um

04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
people should be
 
04:04:51.120 --> 04:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
people should be
more

04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:04:55.490 --> 04:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
um in tune with the consequences of the
 
04:04:57.650 --> 04:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
decision-making process
 
04:05:01.689 --> 04:05:01.699 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they should seek legal
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
advice before they jump into something
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
like this
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not really in favor of another
 
04:05:08.399 --> 04:05:09.530 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not really in favor of another
commission

04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:05:09.540 --> 04:05:12.290 align:start position:0%
commission
okay

04:05:12.290 --> 04:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
then representative Bickford you may
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
have another bite at the Apple
 
04:05:24.359 --> 04:05:26.769 align:start position:0%
have another bite at the Apple
oh

04:05:26.769 --> 04:05:26.779 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:05:29.150 --> 04:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
it's mine now proud Grossman I was
 
04:05:31.969 --> 04:05:31.979 align:start position:0%
delayed thank you chairman
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
um just a thought that comes to mind in
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
order to have a will and to have these
 
04:05:41.469 --> 04:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
legal pieces in place if you're not
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
married you have to have access
 
04:05:47.450 --> 04:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
you have to have money you have to have
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
money to get these legal services that
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
will put things into place for you
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
um so just want to throw that thought
 
04:05:59.090 --> 04:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
out there that it affects maybe
 
04:06:01.849 --> 04:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
potentially couples that don't have
 
04:06:04.010 --> 04:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
access to that
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
I seem to understand or remember at
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
least that on many agreements two
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
parties can do it and have it notarized
 
04:06:26.150 --> 04:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
and this has been in place for a long
 
04:06:29.450 --> 04:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
time because of the very effect that was
 
04:06:31.610 --> 04:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned that many people especially
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
young couples do not have the money for
 
04:06:33.960 --> 04:06:35.769 align:start position:0%
young couples do not have the money for
lawyers

04:06:35.769 --> 04:06:35.779 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else with anything
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to add that there is
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
such a thing it was we've seen as
 
04:06:54.290 --> 04:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
prenuptial we have the anti-nutuals in
 
04:06:56.450 --> 04:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said that they have a
 
04:06:59.809 --> 04:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
higher standing than a contract we often
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
hear I often hear people talk about
 
04:07:00.960 --> 04:07:02.990 align:start position:0%
hear I often hear people talk about
contracts

04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the common law thing is we
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
call it it isn't there's a lot of case
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
law on it which I've looked at
 
04:07:10.319 --> 04:07:11.809 align:start position:0%
law on it which I've looked at
extensively

04:07:11.809 --> 04:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I um I do want to point that out and
 
04:07:16.849 --> 04:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of a lawyer it's a lot cheaper
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
to go to lawyer before you make a
 
04:07:21.889 --> 04:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
mistake than it is active
 
04:07:24.430 --> 04:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
you have to get a divorce lawyer
 
04:07:24.440 --> 04:07:25.969 align:start position:0%
you have to get a divorce lawyer
[Music]

04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:25.979 --> 04:07:29.150 align:start position:0%
[Music]
no

04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:32.150 --> 04:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and one last thing is
 
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that we're
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
that we're doing
 
04:07:39.769 --> 04:07:39.779 align:start position:0%
these execs without looking at what
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
people have sent us remotely as you
 
04:07:43.250 --> 04:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
recall I was looking to try to get in so
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
I could find because the remote gets cut
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
off at noon time so people are sending
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
us information from outside and yeah we
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
may never have looked at it I would say
 
04:07:54.290 --> 04:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's important to us
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
the motion before us to establish a
 
04:08:05.210 --> 04:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
committee to study the issue of
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%

committee which is also a meeting right
 
04:17:03.010 --> 04:17:03.020 align:start position:0%
now so I'm dispatched for this purpose
 
04:17:07.729 --> 04:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh as a sponsor of 218 I would like to
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
point out that basically the bill
 
04:17:13.250 --> 04:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
addresses three problems one is the
 
04:17:16.550 --> 04:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
waiver of court rules two is the ability
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
to create recordings and transcripts and
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
three is the ability to use those
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
recordings and transcripts in the
 
04:17:26.330 --> 04:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
Appellate Procedure
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
now turning first to the waiver of rules
 
04:17:32.210 --> 04:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about this is rules
 
04:17:35.090 --> 04:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
regarding courtroom conduct Rules of
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
Evidence pleadings testimonies
 
04:17:39.769 --> 04:17:39.779 align:start position:0%
representation Discovery depositions
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
interrogatories appeals there there are
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
over 50 pages of rules and I've given
 
04:17:50.150 --> 04:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
you a handout the very first page is an
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
extract from the rules and I want to
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
point you to rule 1.2 which is
 
04:18:01.309 --> 04:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
for the record it's what looks like this
 
04:18:04.010 --> 04:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's this it's this document where
 
04:18:07.070 --> 04:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
it has the squiggle in between 1.2 and
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
2. uh 2.2 which indicates there's a lot
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
of rules in between and
 
04:18:14.040 --> 04:18:14.689 align:start position:0%
of rules in between and
um

04:18:14.689 --> 04:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
so 1.2 basically allows the court
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
to basically disregard or wave family
 
04:18:25.210 --> 04:18:25.220 align:start position:0%
court rules
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
2.2 allows the court to waive All the
 
04:18:31.309 --> 04:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence of the New Hampshire
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
so imagine you're going to court for the
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
first time you're dealing with a court
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh a a court issue and all the rules
 
04:18:47.929 --> 04:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
are pulled out from underneath you the
 
04:18:49.969 --> 04:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
rug is gone you are going to hear
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
several people testify behind me of the
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
specifics of this of this problem but
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
indeed it is a problem it does exist and
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's only fair
 
04:19:06.530 --> 04:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
we believe that we set court rules we
 
04:19:08.809 --> 04:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
have them for all the other courts in
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
the in the state and we follow those
 
04:19:11.399 --> 04:19:12.410 align:start position:0%
the in the state and we follow those
rules

04:19:12.410 --> 04:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:19:16.330 --> 04:19:16.340 align:start position:0%
and they may be waived as as the
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
218 uh provides here with respect to
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
fees in your executive session you may
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
say uh maybe they have to be waived for
 
04:19:28.610 --> 04:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
some other specific purpose if you do
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
that I my only comment is
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
identify a very specific reason why a
 
04:19:40.610 --> 04:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
rule may be waived otherwise this
 
04:19:44.210 --> 04:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
General waiver which exists in 1.2 and
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
2.2 is an anathema to the judicial
 
04:19:47.520 --> 04:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
2.2 is an anathema to the judicial
process

04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to recordings and
 
04:19:55.729 --> 04:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
transcripts the next several pages of
 
04:19:58.130 --> 04:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
that handout deal with this issue the
 
04:20:01.370 --> 04:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
first is a request for proposal from the
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
court system
 
04:20:04.929 --> 04:20:04.939 align:start position:0%
for digital auto
 
04:20:08.570 --> 04:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
recording systems and I want to point
 
04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
you uh to page three number at the
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
bottom uh where
 
04:20:16.680 --> 04:20:17.689 align:start position:0%
bottom uh where
um

04:20:17.689 --> 04:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
it is going over the business
 
04:20:23.330 --> 04:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
requirements of the scope of work of
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
this digital system the very last item
 
04:20:29.570 --> 04:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
item I in the middle of the page says
 
04:20:31.610 --> 04:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
software must be compatible with touch
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
screen kiosk mode which would allow for
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
Standalone use of audio recording
 
04:20:39.769 --> 04:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
functions and features
 
04:20:43.849 --> 04:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
so this this is basically asking for a
 
04:20:45.889 --> 04:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
system where we do not need court
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
reporters we do not need any other
 
04:20:51.410 --> 04:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
function areas in the room we can just
 
04:20:54.550 --> 04:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
have the bailiff or the judge or whoever
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
manage this system and it's all done
 
04:20:57.600 --> 04:21:00.290 align:start position:0%
manage this system and it's all done
digitally

04:21:00.290 --> 04:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the in principle nothing wrong with
 
04:21:03.000 --> 04:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
in the in principle nothing wrong with
that

04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:04.560 --> 04:21:06.530 align:start position:0%
that
however

04:21:06.530 --> 04:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:21:10.010 --> 04:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
you look at the next uh series of pages
 
04:21:13.150 --> 04:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
this is a the request for proposal
 
04:21:17.210 --> 04:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
vendor uh questions to the to the court
 
04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
what is it that you want and I ask you
 
04:21:25.010 --> 04:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
to look at uh their response to 2A
 
04:21:27.530 --> 04:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
which is found on the very next page
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
after the RFP
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and it says if not reporter deck what
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
are the hardware requirements of the
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
touch screen kiosk
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
mode device answer all in one uh Dell PC
 
04:21:47.090 --> 04:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
running Windows 10 with kiosk deep
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
freeze by vary onyx
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
software installed this is for the
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
courtroom that
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
that do not have a court room monitor
 
04:22:00.110 --> 04:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
Court assistant clerk to run their
 
04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
queries instead to have only a bailiff
 
04:22:05.809 --> 04:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
to start and stop the recording so this
 
04:22:07.610 --> 04:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
could be the bailiff or it could be the
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
judge or it could be someone else but a
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
single a single person dealing with this
 
04:22:17.210 --> 04:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
then I ask you to look at item 16 which
 
04:22:19.490 --> 04:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
is on the second fill is on the last
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
page the first the uh the front part of
 
04:22:24.530 --> 04:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
the first page
 
04:22:24.540 --> 04:22:25.550 align:start position:0%
the first page
um

04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
as a summary of our questions this
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
procedure appears more related to
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
Services as opposed to software
 
04:22:35.450 --> 04:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
licensing there are Cloud transcriptions
 
04:22:37.490 --> 04:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
or even interpretive services that
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
appear to be part of the procurement if
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
this is the case please State this and
 
04:22:46.010 --> 04:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
we will make our decision uh to respond
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
based upon the true nature of the uh
 
04:22:48.720 --> 04:22:50.570 align:start position:0%
based upon the true nature of the uh
procurement

04:22:50.570 --> 04:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
I go to the bottom of the answer it says
 
04:22:56.570 --> 04:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
the goal is no is to have no long is is
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
to no longer have court staff manually
 
04:23:01.849 --> 04:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
upload the annual and audio recordings
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
to the transcription service provider
 
04:23:07.130 --> 04:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
and the manual transcription back backup
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
recordings to CD and have an automated
 
04:23:12.650 --> 04:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
process for the court to receive its
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
portions of the funds collected by the
 
04:23:18.170 --> 04:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
transcription service
 
04:23:23.929 --> 04:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
the last page the back is a
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
it is just a simple ad
 
04:23:30.170 --> 04:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and I point you to the right hand
 
04:23:33.530 --> 04:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
side the FTR gold player and the third
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
criteria the audio Channel
 
04:23:42.050 --> 04:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh isolation and foot pedal control
 
04:23:42.060 --> 04:23:43.849 align:start position:0%
uh isolation and foot pedal control
so

04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
this is a device that can be used in
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
this recording system such that
 
04:23:52.729 --> 04:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
a foot pedal can control when the
 
04:23:55.729 --> 04:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
recording is on and when the recording
 
04:23:58.370 --> 04:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
is off and it can be done by one person
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
could be done by the bailiff could be
 
04:24:02.450 --> 04:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
done by the judge could be done by
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
whoever is close to that foot pedal
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
now why is that an issue and why are we
 
04:24:11.689 --> 04:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
04:24:11.699 --> 04:24:12.590 align:start position:0%
asking for
um

04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:15.050 --> 04:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
recordings and transcripts
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
as you are going to hear from various
 
04:24:21.290 --> 04:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
parties to judicial proceedings where
 
04:24:24.410 --> 04:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
the transcripts and recordings do not
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
contain the full information that
 
04:24:31.130 --> 04:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
happened in those hearings
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
information adverse to the court or
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
adverse to one party has been deleted
 
04:24:41.570 --> 04:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
and the consequences are significant for
 
04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
the other party
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
simply gives all parties the opportunity
 
04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
to make recordings and transcripts
 
04:24:54.650 --> 04:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
and then if they're going to be used in
 
04:24:57.050 --> 04:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
any Appellate Procedure I have to point
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
out where they differ from the official
 
04:25:05.150 --> 04:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
recording and transcript
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
of the court and they can carry on their
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
case effectively
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to listen to the the
 
04:25:16.130 --> 04:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
testimony of those that have been
 
04:25:19.969 --> 04:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
adversely impacted by court records that
 
04:25:23.450 --> 04:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
do not reflect what actually happened in
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
the court and considered that this is a
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
option A very simple opportunity to for
 
04:25:34.010 --> 04:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
those litigants to remedy that situation
 
04:25:41.050 --> 04:25:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
04:25:46.610 --> 04:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming to bring this
 
04:25:50.090 --> 04:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
to us today
 
04:25:51.410 --> 04:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
um I have
 
04:25:54.290 --> 04:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
um three questions and uh one is kind of
 
04:25:56.570 --> 04:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
background information and the other two
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
are specifically regarding your proposal
 
04:25:59.819 --> 04:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
are specifically regarding your proposal
here

04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:26:02.210 --> 04:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and the first one is under the
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
current system
 
04:26:06.769 --> 04:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
if an individual a party in one of these
 
04:26:08.570 --> 04:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
Court proceedings feels that the
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
official record does not reflect what
 
04:26:13.250 --> 04:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
actually happened what is the current uh
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
recourse that that individual is able to
 
04:26:15.239 --> 04:26:16.550 align:start position:0%
recourse that that individual is able to
take

04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:26:19.370 --> 04:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
they they only can bring their
 
04:26:22.250 --> 04:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
their case I mean what they they don't
 
04:26:23.929 --> 04:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
have any evidence they don't have a
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
recording because they're they were not
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to take a recording uh and so
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
they can they can make their statements
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
and they can have witnesses if there
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
were any other members of in in that
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
hearing that were there but generally
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.450 --> 04:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
audiences that are very constrained so
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
so the opportunity is generally very
 
04:26:49.790 --> 04:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
limited so generally they're out of luck
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay and then if I can follow up thank
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
you and then the other questions I had
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
um are regarding
 
04:26:58.910 --> 04:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the part of your proposal that would
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
allow individuals to take their own
 
04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
audio or woman to some video as well
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
recordings in these not video videos not
 
04:27:09.110 --> 04:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
allowed in the courts okay that's what I
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
curious whether or not you wanted to
 
04:27:12.530 --> 04:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
allow that so their own audio recorder
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
record um the the first part of the
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:27:18.290 --> 04:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
um how does your bill or how could your
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill provide a chain of custody so that
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
there is not the possibility of any
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
tampering with those audio recordings
 
04:27:27.649 --> 04:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
and this second part of the question is
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
how can this bill ensure the continued
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of children's both
 
04:27:34.729 --> 04:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
identities and disclosures during family
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
core proceedings
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
so the first part is a chain of custody
 
04:27:44.330 --> 04:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
of the recording right how how can
 
04:27:47.689 --> 04:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
how assured that these recordings that
 
04:27:49.610 --> 04:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
um lay people who are involved in these
 
04:27:52.250 --> 04:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
processes have not been edited or
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
altered or changed in any way or that
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
they've remained in the possession of
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
the only the person who was in the room
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is regarding
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
children's confidentiality for both
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
their identity and any disclosures they
 
04:28:10.330 --> 04:28:10.340 align:start position:0%
might make while they're testifying
 
04:28:10.340 --> 04:28:11.990 align:start position:0%
might make while they're testifying
foreign

04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:28:15.309 --> 04:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
so the chain of custody question is is
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
interesting I I mean I think normally
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the reason you have a recording is
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
because and and what you'll you'll hear
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
testimony about is in the in the
 
04:28:30.410 --> 04:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
Court reportings where things have been
 
04:28:33.050 --> 04:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
removed you'll hear a click of the
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
recording going off and I click when it
 
04:28:37.610 --> 04:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
goes back on again
 
04:28:40.969 --> 04:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
so in a recording where that is does not
 
04:28:43.370 --> 04:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
happen you're not going to hear that no
 
04:28:43.380 --> 04:28:46.070 align:start position:0%
happen you're not going to hear that no
uh

04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:49.250 --> 04:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if that is going to be
 
04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
adequate evidence I mean this is
 
04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
something that the that the Appellate
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
Court is going to basically have to
 
04:28:56.159 --> 04:28:58.490 align:start position:0%
Court is going to basically have to
address

04:28:58.490 --> 04:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
as to whether they believe the Integrity
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
the questions for the representatives
 
04:29:14.510 --> 04:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
well excuse me Mr chairman She also
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh children's identity
 
04:29:22.020 --> 04:29:23.090 align:start position:0%
uh children's identity
um

04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
can I restate your question
 
04:29:28.330 --> 04:29:28.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.410 --> 04:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond Raymond thank you
 
04:29:32.330 --> 04:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
yes so the the second part of the
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
question is currently children who are
 
04:29:37.130 --> 04:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
involved in Family Court proceedings
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
um have a right to privacy their
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
identities and any disclosures that they
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
make on the stand is not accessible to
 
04:29:47.090 --> 04:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
the public and it's required even if you
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
look at the you know the court cases are
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
they're not identified by name they're
 
04:29:53.689 --> 04:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
identified by initial to protect their
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
privacy so how would your bill ensure
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
that lay people coming in and making
 
04:30:03.410 --> 04:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
their own recordings are not able to
 
04:30:05.090 --> 04:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
release that information to the public
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
and maintain the privacy of children who
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
may or may not be victims
 
04:30:12.490 --> 04:30:12.500 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
the presumption of your question if I
 
04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
get it right is that this recording
 
04:30:20.210 --> 04:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
that's done in in the hearing would be
 
04:30:22.729 --> 04:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
released to the public as as and a court
 
04:30:25.130 --> 04:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
record would not be and and hence
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some disclosure of
 
04:30:31.729 --> 04:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
of the Privacy Information how does one
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
prevent that yes
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
I in principle one one can't however I
 
04:30:40.729 --> 04:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
do not believe that that is normally the
 
04:30:44.210 --> 04:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
the circumstance uh that's that's being
 
04:30:46.969 --> 04:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
addressed here normally
 
04:30:46.979 --> 04:30:49.070 align:start position:0%
addressed here normally
um

04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
children are not allowed into the into
 
04:30:56.050 --> 04:30:56.060 align:start position:0%
the hearings when most times
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
because they're not allowed to be
 
04:30:57.960 --> 04:31:01.010 align:start position:0%
because they're not allowed to be
Witnesses

04:31:01.010 --> 04:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.090 --> 04:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:09.290 --> 04:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't strike me as a reasonable
 
04:31:11.929 --> 04:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
activity that someone would want to take
 
04:31:14.330 --> 04:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
this recording and then take it to the
 
04:31:18.769 --> 04:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
press the purpose is to document the
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
records of the in an Appellate Procedure
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
you you can truly
 
04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
um make your case for what happened in
 
04:31:30.849 --> 04:31:30.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:33.410 --> 04:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
04:31:35.570 --> 04:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:31:38.570 --> 04:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question relates
 
04:31:41.689 --> 04:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
to lines 13 and 14 where it says the
 
04:31:43.130 --> 04:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court shall review the
 
04:31:44.929 --> 04:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
differences in recordings and Associated
 
04:31:47.090 --> 04:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
transcripts and so on
 
04:31:47.100 --> 04:31:48.229 align:start position:0%
transcripts and so on
um

04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:52.689 --> 04:31:52.699 align:start position:0%
who what uh what level of person or what
 
04:31:55.689 --> 04:31:55.699 align:start position:0%
job in the Appellate Court
 
04:31:58.849 --> 04:31:58.859 align:start position:0%
whose job would it be to review those
 
04:31:58.859 --> 04:32:01.729 align:start position:0%
whose job would it be to review those
differences

04:32:01.729 --> 04:32:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.210 --> 04:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my assumption it's going to be
 
04:32:07.130 --> 04:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
who's ever sitting on the bench on that
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
on that day I mean they're looking at
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
whoever's looking at evidence this is
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
just another piece of evidence just like
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
any other piece of evidence
 
04:32:16.560 --> 04:32:17.630 align:start position:0%
any other piece of evidence
um

04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:17.640 --> 04:32:18.769 align:start position:0%
um
follow-up

04:32:18.769 --> 04:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:32:22.250 --> 04:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:24.349 --> 04:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
04:32:26.929 --> 04:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:32:28.610 --> 04:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
um so I just I guess I have a question
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
when the court is recording right now
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
law that's requiring them to record like
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
a certain amount or anything like to say
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
this entire thing has to be recorded so
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing right now holding the
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
courts who would be an official
 
04:32:49.490 --> 04:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
recording to record the entire thing
 
04:32:51.290 --> 04:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
well they have to record the entire
 
04:32:53.689 --> 04:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
thing in principle in order to make a
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
transcript of what's what happened in
 
04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
the court
 
04:33:02.090 --> 04:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
if if a judge is not behaving
 
04:33:04.490 --> 04:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that's generally
 
04:33:07.150 --> 04:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
and they want to
 
04:33:10.199 --> 04:33:10.970 align:start position:0%
and they want to
um

04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
make some comments that they don't find
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
very acceptable to be on that transcript
 
04:33:21.051 --> 04:33:21.061 align:start position:0%
the button is pushed the transcript
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
stops the comments are made that are
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
adverse to a party or or adverse to the
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
judge if it was heard and then the
 
04:33:33.230 --> 04:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
button is pushed and and the recording
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
goes on so that's what we're trying to
 
04:33:39.650 --> 04:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
protect against we're trying to stop or
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
can I follow it
 
04:33:51.289 --> 04:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
would it be more prudent than to have a
 
04:33:53.051 --> 04:33:53.061 align:start position:0%
law that would require
 
04:33:56.090 --> 04:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
that the judges because I I worry about
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
having a bunch of different people for
 
04:34:01.250 --> 04:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
the reason of um and I have seen quite a
 
04:34:02.810 --> 04:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
few cases where children testify
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
especially in the family courts
 
04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
um you know worried about their privacy
 
04:34:09.170 --> 04:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
would it would it not make more sense to
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
have something that would instead of you
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
know letting people kind of you know
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
record at will or whatever in there and
 
04:34:18.170 --> 04:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different people
 
04:34:20.449 --> 04:34:20.459 align:start position:0%
um to require the courts to have the
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
entire thing recorded because you know
 
04:34:25.490 --> 04:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
start time and time and so you'd able to
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
know if anything had been redacted or
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
anything would that make more sense
 
04:34:32.810 --> 04:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
if you had faith that that was going to
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
actually happen that's fine but you I we
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
started off this uh discussion with the
 
04:34:39.420 --> 04:34:40.609 align:start position:0%
started off this uh discussion with the
rules

04:34:40.609 --> 04:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:34:45.410 --> 04:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
the rule 1.2 we we just we can waive any
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
rule of the Family Court rule 2.2 we can
 
04:34:50.570 --> 04:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
rule All the Rules of Evidence they're
 
04:34:53.650 --> 04:34:53.660 align:start position:0%
just suggestions so
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem here is is
 
04:35:01.369 --> 04:35:01.379 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable judicial conduct is
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.330 --> 04:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi
 
04:35:16.490 --> 04:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
and we will dismiss you from further
 
04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
speaking but not until we first hear
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
from representative Bickford
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr I'm sorry I may miss part
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
of what you said but the gist of it I
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
think is you want you look for a backup
 
04:35:30.349 --> 04:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
system aren't you so essentially looking
 
04:35:34.490 --> 04:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
for a backup for basically people to
 
04:35:38.689 --> 04:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
prove that the the court system has
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
behaved inappropriately and we have if
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
you look back in our records recently we
 
04:35:47.570 --> 04:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
have a lot of problems in the family
 
04:35:50.330 --> 04:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
court I mean I I may just make a
 
04:35:53.029 --> 04:35:53.039 align:start position:0%
statement here I I I'm on the Science
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
Tech and energy committee I'm an
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
engineer and pharmacist and and did drug
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
development uh and and so this is not my
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
area of expertise
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
but I ran to be a representative for the
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
04:36:08.400 --> 04:36:09.890 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
and

04:36:09.890 --> 04:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:14.090 --> 04:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
my constituents are saying we have got a
 
04:36:17.170 --> 04:36:17.180 align:start position:0%
major problem in the family court
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
constituent at the constituent
 
04:36:21.769 --> 04:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
we're being mistreated and the evidence
 
04:36:26.990 --> 04:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
is being hid
 
04:36:29.330 --> 04:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
now there are cases where this has come
 
04:36:29.340 --> 04:36:30.109 align:start position:0%
now there are cases where this has come
out

04:36:30.109 --> 04:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:36:33.529 --> 04:36:33.539 align:start position:0%
but it's an ongoing problem
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
that is the fundamental
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
underpinning of why this legislation is
 
04:36:45.650 --> 04:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:49.010 --> 04:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.051 --> 04:36:54.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:55.670 --> 04:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've got some people who want to
 
04:37:00.051 --> 04:37:00.061 align:start position:0%
testify and uh got a couple of folks who
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
promised to be brief I'm going to hold
 
04:37:03.890 --> 04:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
it to you and please make sure you are
 
04:37:06.849 --> 04:37:06.859 align:start position:0%
actually addressing the bill before us
 
04:37:11.330 --> 04:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
and for three minutes she asks Katrina
 
04:37:11.340 --> 04:37:16.070 align:start position:0%
and for three minutes she asks Katrina
Heinrich

04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:16.080 --> 04:37:39.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.410 --> 04:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman committee my name
 
04:37:44.769 --> 04:37:44.779 align:start position:0%
is Katrina Heinrich and I am in support
 
04:37:48.890 --> 04:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
of HB 218 FN
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
I support it relative to the court rules
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
and transcripts in the judicial Family
 
04:37:52.799 --> 04:37:54.470 align:start position:0%
and transcripts in the judicial Family
Division

04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
Division
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
in my experience in over a decade of
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
Court litigation of fabricated orders
 
04:38:02.090 --> 04:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses three of the most
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
egregious and significant problems that
 
04:38:07.609 --> 04:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
are consistent across comparable cases
 
04:38:09.410 --> 04:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
the family court acts like a business
 
04:38:11.570 --> 04:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
instead of a court of law by emitting
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
due process
 
04:38:15.470 --> 04:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
creating unnecessary financial hardship
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
and dismissing the Rules of Evidence
 
04:38:23.209 --> 04:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rule 2.2 as the esteemed
 
04:38:25.369 --> 04:38:25.379 align:start position:0%
representative just pointed out
 
04:38:27.051 --> 04:38:27.061 align:start position:0%
that's the Rules of Evidence they do not
 
04:38:30.410 --> 04:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.420 --> 04:38:33.529 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:38:33.529 --> 04:38:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
forever decade
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
I have personally been citing zero due
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
process in my case as they were churning
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
out fabricated orders
 
04:38:45.289 --> 04:38:45.299 align:start position:0%
court orders are anchored in fabricated
 
04:38:48.769 --> 04:38:48.779 align:start position:0%
fantasy yet over a decade the orders
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
have unnecessarily protracted the case
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally involved third-party
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
private contractors that were
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
unwarranted and damaged and harmed my
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
children and myself
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
the court orders are not based in
 
04:39:05.209 --> 04:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
reality or fact and therefore are
 
04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
artificially manufactured to achieve a
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
specific agenda
 
04:39:12.890 --> 04:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
these orders without evidence violate
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
due process but even more egregiously
 
04:39:19.490 --> 04:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
carry the weight of consequences
 
04:39:23.689 --> 04:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
lifelong life-altering consequences for
 
04:39:25.970 --> 04:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
those that are being victimized by the
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
court process and the resulting orders
 
04:39:32.090 --> 04:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
usually the non-offending litigant and
 
04:39:32.100 --> 04:39:34.189 align:start position:0%
usually the non-offending litigant and
children

04:39:34.189 --> 04:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
the second and the third thing I want to
 
04:39:38.090 --> 04:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
address is the court transcripts cost
 
04:39:40.730 --> 04:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
and recording accuracy
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
transcripts are the only source for
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
litigants to appeal fabricated orders
 
04:39:49.730 --> 04:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
written transcripts are Beyond
 
04:39:52.010 --> 04:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the typical litigant with
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
a hefty fee schedule
 
04:39:57.530 --> 04:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
transcript accuracy is at the discretion
 
04:39:59.390 --> 04:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
of the Court
 
04:40:01.850 --> 04:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
transcripts have testimony
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
and courtroom behaviors missing without
 
04:40:07.730 --> 04:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
proper law citation or justification for
 
04:40:10.630 --> 04:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
the missing testimony and room behaviors
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
transcripts missing testimony and
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
courtroom behaviors typically show a
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
large segment of time
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
missing with an accompanying word of
 
04:40:18.958 --> 04:40:20.690 align:start position:0%
missing with an accompanying word of
pause

04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
pause
 
04:40:22.730 --> 04:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
this indicates that the live recording
 
04:40:24.650 --> 04:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
is being stopped and started during the
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
court process
 
04:40:28.130 --> 04:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
therefore not an accurate and true
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
accounting of the Court
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
I do have an example that I attended
 
04:40:32.160 --> 04:40:33.230 align:start position:0%
I do have an example that I attended
another

04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
another person's hearing
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
and this happened to be with judge Foley
 
04:40:41.570 --> 04:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
who happens to have a standing computer
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
desk you can see his hands his feet the
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
entire process
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
during the hearing judge Foley tapped
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
the foot pedal and the keyboard area he
 
04:40:54.830 --> 04:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
proceeded to verbally bully and belittle
 
04:40:56.930 --> 04:40:56.940 align:start position:0%
the litigant when the litigant was
 
04:40:58.730 --> 04:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
finally able to get a copy of the
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
transcript the pause segment intact had
 
04:41:04.250 --> 04:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
been activated and the entire court
 
04:41:06.410 --> 04:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
Behavior was missing
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
with over a decade of myself
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
being forced in the Family Court my
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
examples of missing testimony began as
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
early as 2007 in an assault trial prior
 
04:41:21.050 --> 04:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
to my divorce
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
with this brief summary of experiences
 
04:41:25.730 --> 04:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
House Bill 218 not only addresses these
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
distinctive issues addresses a lack of
 
04:41:30.890 --> 04:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
due process the organization of a
 
04:41:32.990 --> 04:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
business entity
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
that engages in third party associations
 
04:41:36.890 --> 04:41:36.900 align:start position:0%

financial distress void of due process
 
04:41:52.368 --> 04:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
and I know the representative gave you
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
the request for proposals paper
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll again close by referring to
 
04:42:03.170 --> 04:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
the last sentence on number 16.
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
and really the last part of that
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
sentence which is they want an automated
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
process for the court to receive its
 
04:42:12.770 --> 04:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
portion of funding collected by the
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
transcription service
 
04:42:16.970 --> 04:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
so funding
 
04:42:20.810 --> 04:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
and inaccurate reporting seems to be the
 
04:42:27.850 --> 04:42:27.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do we have
 
04:42:36.050 --> 04:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you for your testimony
 
04:42:40.368 --> 04:42:40.378 align:start position:0%
I do have copies
 
04:42:48.530 --> 04:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%

04:43:10.910 --> 04:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and members of the
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
board as many of you know my name is
 
04:43:18.190 --> 04:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
Vivian Gerard I've been in this um
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
here testifying today and I'd like to
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
take the transcripts separate then the
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
court rules and I'll and I'll you'll see
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with that so as I had
 
04:43:30.890 --> 04:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned I am self-employed
 
04:43:35.090 --> 04:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
and as Katrina had mentioned to you the
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
cost of audio when you're going through
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
a court battle is 25
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
per CD I had 27 herons and nine to the
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court we rely on the transcripts
 
04:43:50.330 --> 04:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
to be correct
 
04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
the outcome of your case is heavily
 
04:43:56.030 --> 04:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
heavily viewed based on those
 
04:43:59.628 --> 04:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
transcripts and what I want to bring to
 
04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
your attention on the handouts that I'm
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
going to be given to you is I have a
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
Judicial conduct committee that shows
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
how much stuff was changed based on the
 
04:44:14.448 --> 04:44:14.458 align:start position:0%
judge the judge can do whatever they
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
want they do have a button that they can
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
turn on and off and it took many many
 
04:44:24.170 --> 04:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
transcripts for me to show that I was
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
bullied by these judges and two of them
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
got thrown off the bench and one of the
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually there's been a few comments but
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
one of them specifically is reopening a
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
can of worms
 
04:44:37.850 --> 04:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
um it was viewed by the judicial conduct
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
committee and they heard the Audio I
 
04:44:43.490 --> 04:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
have all my transcripts all my audios
 
04:44:46.850 --> 04:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing on any of my
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
transcripts but I remember hearing it in
 
04:44:52.430 --> 04:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
court but there was nothing on any of my
 
04:44:54.890 --> 04:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
documents that showed those
 
04:44:57.650 --> 04:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
that these comments were missing but
 
04:44:59.208 --> 04:44:59.218 align:start position:0%
then once it was reviewed by the
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee this judge
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
was reprimanded for not only just saying
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
all these condescending items but also
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that these were not on the
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
transcripts The JCC cannot provide me
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
that audio so that's what I want to talk
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
about with the transcripts the court
 
04:45:17.820 --> 04:45:18.948 align:start position:0%
about with the transcripts the court
rules

04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
um is another situation
 
04:45:24.650 --> 04:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
this Finder right here I brought this in
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
if you guys would like a copy I'd be
 
04:45:28.190 --> 04:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
more than happy to make you a copy this
 
04:45:30.770 --> 04:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
is what happens when the judge makes up
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
her own rules I went to the Supreme
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
Court and these are all the rules that
 
04:45:38.170 --> 04:45:38.180 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
04:45:42.770 --> 04:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
deviated without any reason there was
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
she did not have any good
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh written information for me as to why
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
she changed her mind and one
 
04:45:55.670 --> 04:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
specifically is the child support which
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
I created this
 
04:46:00.530 --> 04:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
the state law and she said my kids did
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
not deserve child support so why is she
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
changing the rule which was the law
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
which I created why is she changing this
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
rule saying that I don't deserve it when
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court keeps remanding it
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
back to the local Court you have
 
04:46:21.650 --> 04:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty much done but I just want you
 
04:46:24.288 --> 04:46:24.298 align:start position:0%
to know that no matter what happens the
 
04:46:25.970 --> 04:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
judge can make up anything that they
 
04:46:28.490 --> 04:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
want and this is true evidence of what
 
04:46:30.288 --> 04:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:46:33.650 --> 04:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:36.050 --> 04:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
I I'm sorry very very briefly how much
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
is it for the chair recognizes
 
04:46:40.550 --> 04:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you
 
04:46:43.070 --> 04:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
chairman how much did you say it was for
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
one CD of your hearing so one CD is 25
 
04:46:51.050 --> 04:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
that's for an audio CD that's not the
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
written transcript so when you go to the
 
04:46:55.610 --> 04:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court they request a written
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
transcript but in order to make sure
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
that they're correct you're going to
 
04:47:02.090 --> 04:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
listen to the audio and follow along
 
04:47:03.610 --> 04:47:03.620 align:start position:0%
with the transcript
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up one follow-up do you also have
 
04:47:09.050 --> 04:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
to pay for the transcript yes and how
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
much is that
 
04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:11.930 align:start position:0%
much is that
um

04:47:11.930 --> 04:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:17.330 --> 04:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:21.550 --> 04:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.830 --> 04:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
so one thousand seven hundred dollars
 
04:47:27.410 --> 04:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
for two days of testimony
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
two and uh seeing no further questions
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%

I was raised to believe in our country
 
04:48:57.890 --> 04:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
just like all of us and our system of
 
04:49:00.530 --> 04:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
justice and
 
04:49:03.288 --> 04:49:03.298 align:start position:0%

more than just fractured it truly is
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
I when I saw this bill being proposed I
 
04:49:13.368 --> 04:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
was I was delighted I really was very
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
very happy to see that this was being
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
proposed and I was compelled I've never
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
been before a committee before I've
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
never testified and this is the first
 
04:49:24.050 --> 04:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
time there are numerous documented
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
incidents that over the years I've
 
04:49:28.490 --> 04:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
served as petitioners Council as
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative respondents council and
 
04:49:32.930 --> 04:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
sadly I'm in the middle of my own
 
04:49:35.930 --> 04:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
divorce presently
 
04:49:35.940 --> 04:49:37.730 align:start position:0%
divorce presently
um

04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:40.250 --> 04:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
while there's a numerous there are many
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
many instances I could decide I just
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
want to just leave you with this uh the
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
transcripts the recordings are vital
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
they're crucial to cases
 
04:49:52.070 --> 04:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
especially when you're dealing with an
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
appeal one example I can just give you
 
04:49:57.830 --> 04:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
very briefly is uh you know a judge's
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
level of judicial in in judicious
 
04:50:00.480 --> 04:50:01.930 align:start position:0%
level of judicial in in judicious
conduct

04:50:01.930 --> 04:50:01.940 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
04:50:05.390 --> 04:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
I am lost in a sea of adjectives because
 
04:50:08.030 --> 04:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
it is beyond description
 
04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
the the Audio I had requested the Audio
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
I received the auto recording back uh
 
04:50:18.430 --> 04:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
the judge had a complete
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
meltdown uh and said some of the most
 
04:50:23.810 --> 04:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
horrible things I've ever heard and
 
04:50:26.448 --> 04:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
um had he had the judge had then looked
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
at the court reporter and said were we
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
on the record
 
04:50:31.788 --> 04:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
and she looked at the judge and she said
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
judge we are on the record
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
and the judge immediately Departed the
 
04:50:39.288 --> 04:50:39.298 align:start position:0%
courtroom uh I had requested the audio
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
and I believe the the other Council
 
04:50:43.610 --> 04:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
request the audio and the audio abruptly
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
shuts out shuts off
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
just prior to the Meltdown
 
04:50:51.288 --> 04:50:51.298 align:start position:0%
and it's not just that that wasn't
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
captured within the audio but also
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
significant substantive issues were
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with during that time as well uh
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
that could have could have been used on
 
04:51:04.610 --> 04:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
appeal so you know it's not just the
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
judge's conduct that we're talking about
 
04:51:09.170 --> 04:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
we're talking also about uh you know
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
litigants rights and if there is an
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
issue that has just been put on the
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
record that there's no longer any record
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
of it severely jeopardizes the rights of
 
04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
the party
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
in closing I believe this bill does have
 
04:51:23.708 --> 04:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
great Merit
 
04:51:26.510 --> 04:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
I will ensure it will ensure that the
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
playing field is leveled for all parties
 
04:51:30.288 --> 04:51:30.298 align:start position:0%
and will discourage the altering of
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
court records
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
I understand the opposing argument is
 
04:51:34.970 --> 04:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
that this would increase the costs of
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary
 
04:51:38.330 --> 04:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our family court system is
 
04:51:41.270 --> 04:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
fair and balanced and there's an equal
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
playing field for all I think that far
 
04:51:46.970 --> 04:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
outweighs any discussion regarding
 
04:51:46.980 --> 04:51:48.288 align:start position:0%
outweighs any discussion regarding
finances

04:51:48.288 --> 04:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
finances
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
and money so I want to thank you for
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
your time it's been a real privilege and
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
honor to be here today thank you
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:01.250 --> 04:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
04:52:01.260 --> 04:52:03.830 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
testimony

04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.070 --> 04:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.170 --> 04:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Dana
 
04:52:19.070 --> 04:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
Albrecht you may be familiar with me
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
from prior testimony uh on other bills
 
04:52:25.970 --> 04:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
or articles in the union leader I am one
 
04:52:28.670 --> 04:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the parties who has been adversely
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
affected very strongly by the issues
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
raised here and so I would like to speak
 
04:52:37.128 --> 04:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
in strong support of sections two and
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
three of this bill
 
04:52:41.690 --> 04:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh time permitting at the discretion of
 
04:52:44.448 --> 04:52:44.458 align:start position:0%
the committee I can chair I can cycle
 
04:52:47.448 --> 04:52:47.458 align:start position:0%
back to thoughts on one your call on
 
04:52:47.458 --> 04:52:49.010 align:start position:0%
back to thoughts on one your call on
that

04:52:49.010 --> 04:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:50.810 --> 04:52:50.820 align:start position:0%
um please be brief
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
yes uh two reasons uh
 
04:52:57.110 --> 04:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
number one this provides strong
 
04:52:58.850 --> 04:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
accountability to the New Hampshire
 
04:53:01.850 --> 04:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and number two this
 
04:53:05.810 --> 04:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
helps alleviate costs to the parties
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
concerning accountability in my own case
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have a case spanning over two years
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
of judicial misconduct where we have
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
three radically different versions of
 
04:53:22.010 --> 04:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
what's supposed to be an official
 
04:53:26.510 --> 04:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:26.520 --> 04:53:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:31.730 --> 04:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
that hearing uh the handouts are sort of
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
evidence and support they're not my
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
testimony that hearing took place on
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
November 6th 2020 before Master Del pra
 
04:53:44.270 --> 04:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh I immediately ordered a transcript
 
04:53:49.850 --> 04:53:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I got it fairly quickly
 
04:53:56.390 --> 04:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
what I didn't know is that uh within a
 
04:53:59.208 --> 04:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
week escribers wrote an email to the
 
04:54:01.390 --> 04:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts
 
04:54:05.208 --> 04:54:05.218 align:start position:0%
concerning inappropriate comments of the
 
04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
judicial officer
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh notably who gives an f and calling my
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
children a bunch of morons and wrote in
 
04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
their email to the AOC
 
04:54:19.310 --> 04:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
quote of course we're not going to
 
04:54:21.650 --> 04:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
transcribe that
 
04:54:24.170 --> 04:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh the following day chief
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
administrative Judge David King was
 
04:54:29.810 --> 04:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
fully aware of this he's got the email
 
04:54:33.708 --> 04:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
in front of him and he wrote an email to
 
04:54:37.250 --> 04:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
marital Master uh Dal pra in charge of
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing spelling out we've got an
 
04:54:42.890 --> 04:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
issue with these two comments
 
04:54:46.190 --> 04:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh what he didn't do is do anything to
 
04:54:48.288 --> 04:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
correct the transcript and what he
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
didn't do is make clear to The JCC
 
04:54:55.730 --> 04:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
that uh Master Del Pera had done this
 
04:54:58.250 --> 04:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh all he asked is that Master Del pra
 
04:55:02.030 --> 04:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the JCC about it
 
04:55:02.040 --> 04:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
speak to the JCC about it
um

04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
by the time you get to February 16th
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know these are in chronological
 
04:55:08.760 --> 04:55:10.090 align:start position:0%
you know these are in chronological
order

04:55:10.090 --> 04:55:10.100 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:55:14.270 --> 04:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh The JCC is actually dismissed that
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
this is any evidence of wrongdoing why
 
04:55:19.070 --> 04:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
because they don't have an accurate
 
04:55:21.410 --> 04:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
transcript of the proceedings why don't
 
04:55:22.850 --> 04:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
they have an accurate transcript of the
 
04:55:25.010 --> 04:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
proceedings because judge king made sure
 
04:55:27.890 --> 04:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.390 --> 04:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
by the time we get to
 
04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
November 30th you know quite some time
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh I'm up on appeal with this
 
04:55:40.850 --> 04:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
you know appeals you need a transcript
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court dockets the first
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
version of the transcript which is the
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
one I got
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
when I ordered it
 
04:55:51.718 --> 04:55:52.788 align:start position:0%
when I ordered it
um

04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
just like you would expect
 
04:55:57.708 --> 04:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
moving forward by the time they read my
 
04:56:00.010 --> 04:56:00.020 align:start position:0%
brief and you get to December 25th
 
04:56:04.128 --> 04:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
December 10th the Supreme Court realizes
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with this
 
04:56:06.480 --> 04:56:07.610 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with this
transcript

04:56:07.610 --> 04:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
transcript
 
04:56:10.250 --> 04:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
so you can see the order in a supreme
 
04:56:11.690 --> 04:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
court order
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
in my case where judicial misconduct has
 
04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
been left out of a transcript
 
04:56:20.930 --> 04:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
again the administrative judge made sure
 
04:56:23.628 --> 04:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in there
 
04:56:23.638 --> 04:56:24.530 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in there
um

04:56:24.530 --> 04:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:24.540 --> 04:56:26.330 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:56:26.330 --> 04:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:56:28.910 --> 04:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
by then you get the second version of
 
04:56:28.920 --> 04:56:29.990 align:start position:0%
by then you get the second version of
this

04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:56:32.570 --> 04:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have the final order in here
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I could get it to you the final
 
04:56:38.030 --> 04:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
order on appeal is I believe December 6
 
04:56:38.040 --> 04:56:40.128 align:start position:0%
order on appeal is I believe December 6
2021

04:56:40.128 --> 04:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
2021
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that final order is based off a
 
04:56:49.550 --> 04:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:49.560 --> 04:56:51.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
after they already decided this you get
 
04:56:56.448 --> 04:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
to March of next year
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
and the judicial conduct committee
 
04:57:01.610 --> 04:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
orders a third
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
version of a disk transcript
 
04:57:06.890 --> 04:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
the first two versions were only 133
 
04:57:08.330 --> 04:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
pages long
 
04:57:10.070 --> 04:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
the third version
 
04:57:12.650 --> 04:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
is 144 pages long
 
04:57:15.530 --> 04:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
they kind of left this some stuff out
 
04:57:19.250 --> 04:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh I did not include all 410 pages of
 
04:57:21.230 --> 04:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
all three versions of these transcripts
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
I did in this packet include just enough
 
04:57:28.610 --> 04:57:28.620 align:start position:0%
of covers and last pages so you can kind
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
of tell them apart and figure out the
 
04:57:31.080 --> 04:57:32.230 align:start position:0%
of tell them apart and figure out the
differences

04:57:32.230 --> 04:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
differences
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
and read about the Red Sox and their
 
04:57:36.890 --> 04:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
friendly Red Sox fans
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's only in the third version that
 
04:57:43.128 --> 04:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:43.138 --> 04:57:44.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:47.930 --> 04:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
so uh escribers pays again this is
 
04:57:52.610 --> 04:57:52.620 align:start position:0%
covered by The JCC 950 dollars
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
um moving forward by the time we get to
 
04:57:54.958 --> 04:57:56.810 align:start position:0%
um moving forward by the time we get to
October

04:57:56.810 --> 04:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
October
 
04:58:00.050 --> 04:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh I ask that's when I first find out
 
04:58:01.550 --> 04:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
there's a third version
 
04:58:03.770 --> 04:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I ask escribers for it and they tell
 
04:58:05.208 --> 04:58:05.218 align:start position:0%
me they're not allowed to give it to me
 
04:58:06.650 --> 04:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the judicial
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
branch about one minute to wrap it up
 
04:58:12.368 --> 04:58:12.378 align:start position:0%
please okay uh
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I think the rest of this speaks for
 
04:58:15.840 --> 04:58:17.090 align:start position:0%
and I think the rest of this speaks for
itself

04:58:17.090 --> 04:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:58:17.100 --> 04:58:19.010 align:start position:0%
itself
uh

04:58:19.010 --> 04:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
that sort of the story I think we've
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
kind of become a spectacle to the world
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
and to angels and to men and just to
 
04:58:32.330 --> 04:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
address comments on privacy for rebuttal
 
04:58:32.340 --> 04:58:33.170 align:start position:0%
address comments on privacy for rebuttal
um

04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
the bill as written
 
04:58:38.810 --> 04:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh says a party to a case can make a
 
04:58:41.448 --> 04:58:41.458 align:start position:0%
recording well a party to the face can
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
get the official recording and release
 
04:58:45.288 --> 04:58:45.298 align:start position:0%
that as well if they feel like it so
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
there's really no difference there
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
um between something they made or the
 
04:58:54.708 --> 04:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
official in terms of privacy
 
04:58:56.930 --> 04:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
um if you would like me to speak to
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
number one I can otherwise I'll take
 
04:59:01.128 --> 04:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
questions a section one of the bill
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'll take questions because I
 
04:59:07.730 --> 04:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:59:16.430 --> 04:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Albrecht uh you've read the bill yes
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
specific to where there were States in
 
04:59:22.850 --> 04:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh line seven that ultimately three
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
transcripts are generated
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
plaintiff defendant and the court
 
04:59:27.958 --> 04:59:29.628 align:start position:0%
plaintiff defendant and the court
however

04:59:29.628 --> 04:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
the last statement says the courts
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
reviews the differences and then decides
 
04:59:35.868 --> 04:59:35.878 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate does that not make
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:46.490 --> 04:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
and how it's worded
 
04:59:46.500 --> 04:59:47.990 align:start position:0%
and how it's worded
you

04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:59:48.000 --> 04:59:50.830 align:start position:0%
you
uh

04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:50.840 --> 04:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
 
why

04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:59:54.288 --> 04:59:54.298 align:start position:0%
I forgive me I don't understand the
 
04:59:57.050 --> 04:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
question if we've got
 
04:59:59.330 --> 04:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
um well let me now clarify what and I
 
05:00:01.368 --> 05:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony today you're
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
stating uh well what I understand you're
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
stating and not previous testimony as
 
05:00:05.400 --> 05:00:06.110 align:start position:0%
stating and not previous testimony as
well

05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I have the same sensitivity of
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
honesty in government in the court
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
system is
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
the uh who is hitting the button the key
 
05:00:18.890 --> 05:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
the TA the tag on what is recorded and
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
then what becomes the
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
Authority having jurisdictions specific
 
05:00:24.650 --> 05:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
to the testimony
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
as written
 
05:00:28.550 --> 05:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
now there could be three in here there's
 
05:00:31.128 --> 05:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
again plaintiff defendant right and and
 
05:00:33.890 --> 05:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
as I as you stated but that last
 
05:00:36.410 --> 05:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
statement says that that the court The
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
Authority having jurisdiction within the
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
am I said determines which recordings
 
05:00:48.170 --> 05:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
and transcripts are complete and
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
adequate for use in the Appellate
 
05:00:51.410 --> 05:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
Procedure doesn't it make the intent
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
moot that that the intent there could
 
05:00:58.128 --> 05:00:58.138 align:start position:0%
still allow the judge to kick out what
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
he or he or she does not want to have in
 
05:01:03.410 --> 05:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
the public sector uh correct but now you
 
05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
have two other recordings to dispute
 
05:01:08.930 --> 05:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
that to cover all of these other cases
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
you've heard about where people don't
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
have the benefit like I do of sort of
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
more proof and evidence that something
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
was left out okay one follow-up Mr
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman does that
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
not then presume that the plaintiff or
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
defendant within the case
 
05:01:30.410 --> 05:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
will then appeal to the to the to the
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
higher court and the expense and the
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
cost of that could be a be a restriction
 
05:01:37.550 --> 05:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
on them able to do that
 
05:01:40.128 --> 05:01:40.138 align:start position:0%
uh sure but if they're going to appeal
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
they're better off with it than with
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
that without without it and they could
 
05:01:45.170 --> 05:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
also send it to the JCC rather than do
 
05:01:46.368 --> 05:01:46.378 align:start position:0%
an appeal if they feel there's
 
05:01:46.378 --> 05:01:47.690 align:start position:0%
an appeal if they feel there's
misconduct

05:01:47.690 --> 05:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
05:01:50.330 --> 05:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
one final one one more one more one
 
05:01:52.070 --> 05:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
final one
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
would you agree then what we both just
 
05:01:58.010 --> 05:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
said that this can continue on is that a
 
05:02:01.310 --> 05:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
wording here specific that the testimony
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
as found in the court
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
between the as in in the court hearing
 
05:02:10.368 --> 05:02:10.378 align:start position:0%
is specifically only document that will
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
be then made available to all as
 
05:02:12.360 --> 05:02:17.750 align:start position:0%
be then made available to all as
recorded

05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:20.690 --> 05:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
I think if there's a dispute you have up
 
05:02:22.368 --> 05:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
to three versions and in most cases
 
05:02:24.050 --> 05:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
hopefully you don't have a dispute and
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy with the official one
 
05:02:27.890 --> 05:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
and you haven't been up to this point
 
05:02:29.570 --> 05:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
and I haven't been
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.850 --> 05:02:36.860 align:start position:0%
I don't think I deserve that title but
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
they call me speaker earlier they're
 
05:02:43.610 --> 05:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.670 --> 05:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
05:02:49.868 --> 05:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that's good
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
well it's supposed to be changed um I
 
05:02:55.850 --> 05:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
think what you where we left off uh is
 
05:02:57.650 --> 05:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
where I want to pick up on that last
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
sentence and the point I may have been
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
missed there was that it's you've now
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
moved into the applet Court you've got a
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
different judge on it and that may have
 
05:03:09.708 --> 05:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
been missed but I also own that same
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
sentence I'm concerned about the last
 
05:03:14.448 --> 05:03:14.458 align:start position:0%
phrase there where it's and just read
 
05:03:16.730 --> 05:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
the whole sentence it says the Appellate
 
05:03:19.250 --> 05:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
Court shall review the differences in
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
recordings and Associated transcripts
 
05:03:23.330 --> 05:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not we're in a different
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
court now right and determine which
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
recordings and transcripts are complete
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
inadequate for use in the Apple
 
05:03:31.320 --> 05:03:32.990 align:start position:0%
inadequate for use in the Apple
procedure

05:03:32.990 --> 05:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:03:35.208 --> 05:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
by using the word complete it makes me
 
05:03:36.890 --> 05:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
think it you have to choose between one
 
05:03:38.030 --> 05:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
and the other and it sounds like what
 
05:03:40.610 --> 05:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
you want to do is be able to let the
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
athlete judge choose which pieces
 
05:03:46.250 --> 05:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
they want so I'm concerned about
 
05:03:48.550 --> 05:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
for completeness
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think you're correct and I suspect you
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
there might be possible for some
 
05:03:55.850 --> 05:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
language revisions to better accomplish
 
05:03:58.850 --> 05:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
the goal here just to make sure if
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
people feel there are discrepancies that
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
they can look at
 
05:04:05.090 --> 05:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
all of the available material maybe you
 
05:04:07.128 --> 05:04:07.138 align:start position:0%
can help us with that I do not see any
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors of this bill in the room
 
05:04:15.170 --> 05:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
so if one has questions of improvement
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
before this bill is exact which it won't
 
05:04:20.448 --> 05:04:20.458 align:start position:0%
be today uh just a reminder you may wish
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
to speak to representative Bernardi or
 
05:04:24.170 --> 05:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
one of the co-sponsors because they're
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
not here to note them
 
05:04:27.000 --> 05:04:31.070 align:start position:0%
not here to note them
foreign

05:04:31.070 --> 05:04:31.080 align:start position:0%

you've heard numbers of people in
 
05:04:46.090 --> 05:04:46.100 align:start position:0%
support of the bill now the chair
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
recognizes someone in opposition to the
 
05:04:52.128 --> 05:04:52.138 align:start position:0%
bill and as we are trying to balance
 
05:04:55.628 --> 05:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
fairness especially when uh testimonies
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
we wish to be limited in length the
 
05:05:02.470 --> 05:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
opposition will get a little bit more
 
05:05:06.010 --> 05:05:06.020 align:start position:0%
because this person is the opposition
 
05:05:09.410 --> 05:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh Richard head
 
05:05:10.990 --> 05:05:11.000 align:start position:0%

and I appreciate your comment Mr
 
05:05:33.050 --> 05:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
chairman and I put five minutes on the
 
05:05:35.810 --> 05:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
card if with obviously your discretion I
 
05:05:38.810 --> 05:05:38.820 align:start position:0%
may ask for a little more time than that
 
05:05:38.820 --> 05:05:40.190 align:start position:0%
may ask for a little more time than that
um

05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:42.410 --> 05:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
05:05:44.690 --> 05:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill one as I had
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned this this morning and as the
 
05:05:47.930 --> 05:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
judges mentioned this morning there is
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
no longer a family court family court is
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
used in the in the language of this bill
 
05:05:54.770 --> 05:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
there's a Family Division
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
and Family Division I think it is also
 
05:06:00.050 --> 05:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
important to recognize and recall what
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
exactly is in the Family Division
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
because we're not only talking about uh
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
divorces and parenting So Family
 
05:06:10.128 --> 05:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
Division does have divorce obviously in
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
parenting it involves child support it
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
involves domestic violence petitions it
 
05:06:18.050 --> 05:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
involves guardianships of minors uh
 
05:06:20.448 --> 05:06:20.458 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights abuse and
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
neglect actions children in need of
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
services juvenile delinquency and some
 
05:06:26.400 --> 05:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
services juvenile delinquency and some
adoptions

05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
adoptions
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is not limited in its scope it
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
says family court again my assumption it
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
would be that that really is intended to
 
05:06:40.970 --> 05:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
refer to family division
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
I think it's also
 
05:06:42.958 --> 05:06:43.788 align:start position:0%
I think it's also
um

05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
important to know in in and
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to start with the
 
05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
transcript and recording part of this
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill and then talk about the rules part
 
05:06:56.810 --> 05:06:56.820 align:start position:0%
of the bill it's also important to know
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
and recognize that there is currently a
 
05:07:00.000 --> 05:07:01.788 align:start position:0%
and recognize that there is currently a
rule

05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
rule
 
05:07:04.430 --> 05:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
um regarding photographing and recording
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
and broadcasting that already exists in
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
our in our court and in our family
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
division in rule 1.29 says that accept
 
05:07:15.230 --> 05:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
as otherwise provided by this rule or
 
05:07:16.730 --> 05:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
other provisions of law in the long
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
world I'm not going to read the whole
 
05:07:17.638 --> 05:07:19.128 align:start position:0%
world I'm not going to read the whole
thing

05:07:19.128 --> 05:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:07:21.530 --> 05:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
um any person whether or not a member of
 
05:07:23.448 --> 05:07:23.458 align:start position:0%
an established media organization shall
 
05:07:25.310 --> 05:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
be permitted to photograph record and
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
broadcast all Court proceedings that are
 
05:07:29.570 --> 05:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
open to the public
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
provided that such person provides
 
05:07:33.770 --> 05:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
advance notice to the court in
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
accordance with the rule that he or she
 
05:07:39.288 --> 05:07:39.298 align:start position:0%
intends to do so there is a mechanism
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently in place with the judge's
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
permission to record in a courtroom and
 
05:07:46.730 --> 05:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's important because the judge is
 
05:07:48.890 --> 05:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
going to recognize who are the parties
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
who's going to be testifying what are
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
the issues and
 
05:07:54.480 --> 05:07:55.190 align:start position:0%
the issues and
um

05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
is it one legally confidential so it
 
05:08:01.010 --> 05:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
cannot be broadcast and and the intent
 
05:08:05.330 --> 05:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
of this bill I get is uh to provide a a
 
05:08:07.128 --> 05:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
copy of a record
 
05:08:07.138 --> 05:08:08.208 align:start position:0%
copy of a record
but

05:08:08.208 --> 05:08:08.218 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
if as this bill is written there is no
 
05:08:12.890 --> 05:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
discretion on the part of the judge and
 
05:08:14.448 --> 05:08:14.458 align:start position:0%
everybody has a right to record
 
05:08:17.390 --> 05:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
everything in Family Division we are
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
talking about a a tremendous breadth of
 
05:08:24.970 --> 05:08:24.980 align:start position:0%
cases and also a tremendous risk because
 
05:08:27.288 --> 05:08:27.298 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the goal of it being
 
05:08:29.810 --> 05:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
created as an alternate record it can be
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
also be used uh in an abusive way and it
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
can be used because these things can be
 
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
immediately posted on the internet they
 
05:08:40.128 --> 05:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
can be modified if somebody wants to
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
post it on the internet and they're not
 
05:08:44.810 --> 05:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
things that are in our control so we
 
05:08:46.730 --> 05:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
don't have any control over these over
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
these recordings so they are property of
 
05:08:51.470 --> 05:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
the person who recorded it the other
 
05:08:53.570 --> 05:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is that if somebody is
 
05:08:55.610 --> 05:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
recording and the judge doesn't know and
 
05:08:58.368 --> 05:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
the judge cannot say hey by the way
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
somebody in the audience may be
 
05:09:01.550 --> 05:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
recording this it may capture
 
05:09:03.350 --> 05:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
conversations going on around that
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
person and they're unaware necessarily
 
05:09:08.208 --> 05:09:08.218 align:start position:0%
that there's a recording going on um
 
05:09:10.970 --> 05:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
there are tremendous risks associated
 
05:09:14.090 --> 05:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
with simply allowing a recording and in
 
05:09:16.010 --> 05:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
fact mandating the right to have a
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
recording in this in this wide range of
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
of proceedings
 
05:09:21.718 --> 05:09:24.350 align:start position:0%
of proceedings
um

05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:27.050 --> 05:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of it is that this as
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out the bill would say
 
05:09:32.090 --> 05:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
that the Appellate judges which is our
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court we don't have an
 
05:09:33.360 --> 05:09:34.750 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court we don't have an
intermediate

05:09:34.750 --> 05:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
intermediate
 
05:09:37.850 --> 05:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
appellate court that for the vast
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
majorities there are some instances
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
where you peel the superior court but
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
primarily what we're talking about is an
 
05:09:45.230 --> 05:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
appeal to the Supreme Court and as I
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
read this it would say that the
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court shall review the
 
05:09:49.550 --> 05:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
differences so the judges sort of huddle
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
start listening to days and days of test
 
05:09:54.770 --> 05:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
of recordings and try to figure it out
 
05:09:57.970 --> 05:09:57.980 align:start position:0%
and the reality is the judges don't
 
05:10:00.650 --> 05:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
determine what is the record the Supreme
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
Court judges for example the re the
 
05:10:06.530 --> 05:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
transcript is created by a transcription
 
05:10:08.750 --> 05:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
agency that's certified they have
 
05:10:10.730 --> 05:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
certain guidelines and and requirements
 
05:10:14.330 --> 05:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
in the in the process they use to make a
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
transcript of the official proceeding if
 
05:10:19.128 --> 05:10:19.138 align:start position:0%
something is said off the Record and it
 
05:10:20.868 --> 05:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
is captured on the audio that does not
 
05:10:22.430 --> 05:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
become a part of the official record
 
05:10:25.250 --> 05:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's not a part of the proceeding and
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
they have they have you know various
 
05:10:29.770 --> 05:10:29.780 align:start position:0%
rules and standards that they apply and
 
05:10:33.650 --> 05:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
escribers is is the current creator of
 
05:10:35.810 --> 05:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
the official transcript that is sent to
 
05:10:37.490 --> 05:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court it's not done by Court
 
05:10:39.250 --> 05:10:39.260 align:start position:0%
Personnel it's not done
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court Justices
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that recorded or that transcript is
 
05:10:47.090 --> 05:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
then provided to the court as the
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
official transcript
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
says the official transcript is an error
 
05:10:55.788 --> 05:10:55.798 align:start position:0%
and here's the error and this is what we
 
05:10:57.890 --> 05:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
think happened and this does happen they
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
file something with the Supreme Court so
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
everything this transcript is missing
 
05:11:01.378 --> 05:11:02.330 align:start position:0%
everything this transcript is missing
something

05:11:02.330 --> 05:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:11:04.490 --> 05:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court Justices do not then
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
sort of gather up and decide what it is
 
05:11:09.650 --> 05:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
what what is an official transcript they
 
05:11:12.170 --> 05:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
send it back to escribers and say this
 
05:11:14.090 --> 05:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
was this was raised tell us what the
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
official record says and it comes back
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes it's a spelling
 
05:11:21.050 --> 05:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
correction sometimes it's a word it
 
05:11:22.490 --> 05:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
depends on what it is
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
um but the official transcript is
 
05:11:29.208 --> 05:11:29.218 align:start position:0%
created by escribers
 
05:11:32.570 --> 05:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
um in addition this this bill does not
 
05:11:34.850 --> 05:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
have any standards for the transcript
 
05:11:36.530 --> 05:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
that would be created by this third
 
05:11:38.810 --> 05:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
party is it
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
created by an official trans
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
or a certified transcriptionist is it
 
05:11:47.570 --> 05:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
something that is a transcript created
 
05:11:50.150 --> 05:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
by a party writing really fast and
 
05:11:51.948 --> 05:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
saying this is the transcript I created
 
05:11:54.410 --> 05:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any sort of Standards
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
associated with it which is the the sort
 
05:11:59.868 --> 05:11:59.878 align:start position:0%
of Need for having a a certified
 
05:12:02.810 --> 05:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
official record
 
05:12:02.820 --> 05:12:04.310 align:start position:0%
official record
um

05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
so we do in terms of of the recording
 
05:12:11.930 --> 05:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
you know there is a process by which a
 
05:12:14.930 --> 05:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
party or anyone can ask for to make a
 
05:12:16.970 --> 05:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
recording during the course of a of a
 
05:12:19.128 --> 05:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
public proceeding
 
05:12:21.170 --> 05:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
it just simply has to be done with the
 
05:12:23.208 --> 05:12:23.218 align:start position:0%
presiding judge's permission because the
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
presiding judge needs to be able to
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
control the courtroom another example
 
05:12:30.050 --> 05:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
would be we have somebody who's in these
 
05:12:33.650 --> 05:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
are very personal matters and if if in
 
05:12:36.050 --> 05:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
the course of testimony it becomes
 
05:12:39.050 --> 05:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
apparent that just the fact that that
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
some number of people are recording this
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
Um this can affect the way in which
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
people are testifying and that can have
 
05:12:51.410 --> 05:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
you know simply that that fact can have
 
05:12:54.050 --> 05:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
an impact on some incredibly personal
 
05:12:57.530 --> 05:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
testimony uh and and we do have a
 
05:12:59.810 --> 05:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
concern that this is going to adversely
 
05:13:02.570 --> 05:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
affect the way in which people testify
 
05:13:04.368 --> 05:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
the way in which information is provided
 
05:13:08.090 --> 05:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
to the judge and ultimately have a very
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the judicial system
 
05:13:13.490 --> 05:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the system and the
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
ability of a judge to control the
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
judge's own courtroom
 
05:13:18.718 --> 05:13:19.730 align:start position:0%
judge's own courtroom
um

05:13:19.730 --> 05:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:22.128 --> 05:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
05:13:25.850 --> 05:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
the judge turning on and turning off the
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
the the recording machine I did so I've
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
I've heard this before last year there
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
was testimony to that effect
 
05:13:34.850 --> 05:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
specifically in that case it was Judge
 
05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
intercasso I reached out to the clerk in
 
05:13:40.250 --> 05:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I said there was testimony
 
05:13:42.410 --> 05:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
that Judge Andrew Casa was turning the
 
05:13:45.350 --> 05:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
recording on and off can you just tell
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
me can she do that from the bench so the
 
05:13:50.690 --> 05:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
clerk went up to then former judge
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
intercostal's bench and there is no
 
05:13:58.610 --> 05:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
switch behind the bench and I also
 
05:14:00.590 --> 05:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
um last week when I when I was talking
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
with judge Garner about him coming this
 
05:14:05.330 --> 05:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
morning I asked him can you turn that
 
05:14:06.890 --> 05:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
recording on and off
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
and the clerk in Nashua and judge
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
garnerable said no they don't have
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
controls at the bench you have to get up
 
05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
you have to get off the bench you have
 
05:14:16.970 --> 05:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
to go down to where the clerk would
 
05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
normally sit and manually turn it on and
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
off so there's like physically you have
 
05:14:24.050 --> 05:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
to get up and go down and turn it on and
 
05:14:29.390 --> 05:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
off there is and and the clerk and ashwa
 
05:14:32.570 --> 05:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh said there is a mute button behind
 
05:14:36.410 --> 05:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
the bench okay so she's very thorough
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
Ransom tests and what the mute button
 
05:14:41.150 --> 05:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
does is when people are coming up for a
 
05:14:43.610 --> 05:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
bench conference she can hit mute the
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
judge can hit mute and it doesn't go
 
05:14:48.770 --> 05:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
over the speakers in the courtroom so he
 
05:14:50.570 --> 05:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
can have a private conversation at the
 
05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
bench that's not broadcast in the
 
05:14:55.010 --> 05:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
courtroom but the recording continues to
 
05:14:57.590 --> 05:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
run the mute button did not and she
 
05:15:00.170 --> 05:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
tested it did not does not impact the
 
05:15:04.430 --> 05:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
recording itself so I was unable at
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
least in those instances where I
 
05:15:08.510 --> 05:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
specifically asked for a check on it
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
they could not recreate that in any way
 
05:15:14.208 --> 05:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
shape or form and judge Garner said
 
05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is simply in his experience no way
 
05:15:18.770 --> 05:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
of doing it we do not in Circuit Court
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
which is Family Division have court
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
monitors a clerk will sometimes be
 
05:15:25.730 --> 05:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
responsible or a bailiff and you heard
 
05:15:25.740 --> 05:15:26.590 align:start position:0%
responsible or a bailiff and you heard
that

05:15:26.590 --> 05:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
the judge will ask the bailiff if nobody
 
05:15:30.650 --> 05:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
else in the courtroom because we don't
 
05:15:33.010 --> 05:15:33.020 align:start position:0%
use Court monitors there anymore
 
05:15:35.690 --> 05:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
to turn it on and not turn off but again
 
05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
has to announce bailiff can you please
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
turn that off
 
05:15:40.080 --> 05:15:41.330 align:start position:0%
turn that off
um

05:15:41.330 --> 05:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:43.850 --> 05:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
I'm there's some other stuff but I'm in
 
05:15:46.250 --> 05:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
the interest of time I'm going to turn
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
over to the issue of court rules and
 
05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
just briefly address the issue of court
 
05:15:51.298 --> 05:15:53.150 align:start position:0%
just briefly address the issue of court
rules

05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:15:53.160 --> 05:15:54.530 align:start position:0%
rules
um

05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:55.970 --> 05:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
there were a couple things I just want
 
05:15:58.788 --> 05:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
to clarify rule 1.2 as was said talks
 
05:16:01.128 --> 05:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
about waiver of rules doesn't just
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
simply say a judge can waive any and all
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules and by the way there is in the
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch side a rule about rules
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
jail Carr has all the rules about what
 
05:16:14.090 --> 05:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
rules are and jailcar has a very
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
specific rule that says if there is
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
going to be authority to waive any rule
 
05:16:20.750 --> 05:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
there has to be a rule that says you can
 
05:16:22.250 --> 05:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
waive rules you don't have a rule that
 
05:16:23.930 --> 05:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
says you can waive rules you simply
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
can't do it every administrative rule
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
you you look at there'll be a provision
 
05:16:32.208 --> 05:16:32.218 align:start position:0%
maybe not up top the way we do it we put
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
it right at the top
 
05:16:36.050 --> 05:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
executive branch rules all have a waiver
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
provision it's a part of rule making we
 
05:16:41.030 --> 05:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
put ours at the very top but it does not
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
simply say the judge can waive any and
 
05:16:46.610 --> 05:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
all rules it says a rule can be waived
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
for if good cause appears and Justice
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
may require it that's the sort of
 
05:16:53.448 --> 05:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
standard language you will see in a
 
05:16:55.310 --> 05:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
rules waiver provision
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
with regard to The Rules of Evidence it
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
does not say a judge can waive the rules
 
05:17:02.570 --> 05:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
of evidence rule 2.2 says that the rules
 
05:17:05.448 --> 05:17:05.458 align:start position:0%
of evidence do not apply and this is
 
05:17:07.610 --> 05:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
again this is Family Division Rule and
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
if you think about it it's an important
 
05:17:13.730 --> 05:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
part of Family Division because the vast
 
05:17:15.770 --> 05:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people appearing in
 
05:17:17.448 --> 05:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
Family Division are pro se they're not
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
represented by Council I took a lot of
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
evidence in law school I've practiced
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
law for 30 plus years I know the rules
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
of evidence if you have not shown up in
 
05:17:28.970 --> 05:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
court The Rules of Evidence will trap
 
05:17:31.310 --> 05:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
you they will trap the unwary you you
 
05:17:32.690 --> 05:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
know that is
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
a way in which a a party who's not
 
05:17:36.240 --> 05:17:37.490 align:start position:0%
a way in which a a party who's not
deeply

05:17:37.490 --> 05:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
deeply
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Rules of Evidence can
 
05:17:41.530 --> 05:17:41.540 align:start position:0%
get stuck and trapped
 
05:17:44.090 --> 05:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
so we do have a rule that says the Rules
 
05:17:46.730 --> 05:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
of Evidence don't apply but the court
 
05:17:48.410 --> 05:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
May utilize the New Hampshire Rules of
 
05:17:50.090 --> 05:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
Evidence to enhance the predictable
 
05:17:52.368 --> 05:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
orderly fair and reliable presentation
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
of evidence so for example there is and
 
05:17:57.650 --> 05:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
people generally get this the evidence
 
05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's being presented has to be
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
relevant so yes the judges May shut
 
05:18:05.570 --> 05:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
somebody down and say you're not talking
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
about the issue that is before us today
 
05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about something that's
 
05:18:10.970 --> 05:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
very important to you may be deeply
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
important to you but today I'm trying to
 
05:18:15.770 --> 05:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
resolve this issue and so I won't allow
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that evidence it has to be relevant so
 
05:18:19.310 --> 05:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
that is a rule of evidence that's the
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
type of orderly necessary implementation
 
05:18:23.868 --> 05:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
of the rules that a judge is going to
 
05:18:27.890 --> 05:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
apply in order to ensure that they fit
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
within the 30 minutes because as you
 
05:18:31.850 --> 05:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
heard judge Garner this morning there
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be another 20 people behind
 
05:18:36.410 --> 05:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
you who also need to come up and have
 
05:18:37.970 --> 05:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
their hearings
 
05:18:39.410 --> 05:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
um so there needs to be some level of
 
05:18:41.270 --> 05:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
control and again it gets to that issue
 
05:18:44.208 --> 05:18:44.218 align:start position:0%
of a judge being able to control their
 
05:18:47.690 --> 05:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
own courtroom in their own docket
 
05:18:47.700 --> 05:18:49.250 align:start position:0%
own courtroom in their own docket
um

05:18:49.250 --> 05:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:51.650 --> 05:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of the rules is you
 
05:18:53.390 --> 05:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
have if you don't know what the rules
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
are to do a blanket waiver without any
 
05:18:58.250 --> 05:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
discretion on the judge so judge under
 
05:19:00.170 --> 05:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
this under this bill would have no
 
05:19:02.510 --> 05:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
discretion to waive a rule that simply
 
05:19:06.050 --> 05:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
says thou shall not waive any rules we
 
05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
have as was said a number of rules and
 
05:19:10.368 --> 05:19:10.378 align:start position:0%
if you're not
 
05:19:12.288 --> 05:19:12.298 align:start position:0%
deeply familiar with all of them and if
 
05:19:14.208 --> 05:19:14.218 align:start position:0%
you haven't looked at all the unintended
 
05:19:17.208 --> 05:19:17.218 align:start position:0%
consequences are are significant so for
 
05:19:19.310 --> 05:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
example we have a rule that says you
 
05:19:22.010 --> 05:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to appear within 15 days if you
 
05:19:23.810 --> 05:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
can't waive that sometimes there are
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
very legitimate reasons why somebody is
 
05:19:27.890 --> 05:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
going to be late on an appearance we
 
05:19:30.948 --> 05:19:30.958 align:start position:0%
can't waive that rule 15 days Days 16 in
 
05:19:32.208 --> 05:19:32.218 align:start position:0%
the morning they come in they say
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
whatever their their excuse was to valid
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
excuse we can't waive the rules
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislature says we cannot waive rules
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
your appearance cannot come in
 
05:19:44.448 --> 05:19:44.458 align:start position:0%
okay now what that person doesn't have
 
05:19:45.770 --> 05:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
an appearance in the court they can't
 
05:19:45.780 --> 05:19:47.448 align:start position:0%
an appearance in the court they can't
participate

05:19:47.448 --> 05:19:47.458 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:19:51.050 --> 05:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
um it is we have a rule that says when
 
05:19:52.730 --> 05:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
addressing a witness or the court you
 
05:19:54.410 --> 05:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
should stand
 
05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
um okay we can't waive that rule
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are people who are not going to be
 
05:19:59.570 --> 05:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
able to stand
 
05:20:02.448 --> 05:20:02.458 align:start position:0%
I also don't fully understand the
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
statutory or I'm sorry the bill in the
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
sense of the rules because a lot of the
 
05:20:09.890 --> 05:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
times the rule says you know X is the
 
05:20:11.690 --> 05:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
rule unless otherwise Allowed by the
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
judge is that a waiver under this bill
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
or is that not a waiver under the bill
 
05:20:19.010 --> 05:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
they may not be a waiver under the bill
 
05:20:20.990 --> 05:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
because it's part of the rule itself but
 
05:20:23.150 --> 05:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of the rules say that so it
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
becomes very unclear at least in my mind
 
05:20:28.610 --> 05:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
as to as to truly what the intent is of
 
05:20:32.330 --> 05:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.340 --> 05:20:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:40.550 --> 05:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I think the the inability of
 
05:20:42.770 --> 05:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
a blanket prohibition on the court to
 
05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
way to to not be able to waive rules of
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
prohibition and waiving rules has the
 
05:20:50.208 --> 05:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
opportunity and can create tremendous
 
05:20:52.550 --> 05:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
barriers to Justice create tremendous
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
barriers to fairness
 
05:20:58.368 --> 05:20:58.378 align:start position:0%
um and has just a host of unintended
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
consequences I think what you have is
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
judges who are trying to apply a very
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
complex statutory scheme in all of these
 
05:21:08.760 --> 05:21:10.010 align:start position:0%
complex statutory scheme in all of these
areas

05:21:10.010 --> 05:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that I that I went through with it
 
05:21:13.730 --> 05:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
which is within the context of Family
 
05:21:13.740 --> 05:21:15.650 align:start position:0%
which is within the context of Family
Division

05:21:15.650 --> 05:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
Division
 
05:21:20.510 --> 05:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and it is ultimately the judge's dis
 
05:21:22.550 --> 05:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
the need for the judge to be able to
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
take into account all of the facts and
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances when applying the rules
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
and applying the the uh right of of
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
anyone not just parties to record within
 
05:21:37.430 --> 05:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
the courthouse or within a courtroom
 
05:21:40.090 --> 05:21:40.100 align:start position:0%
um and to create a
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
unwavable situation an unwaverable
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
process is going to have significant
 
05:21:50.628 --> 05:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
negative consequences on ultimately the
 
05:21:53.208 --> 05:21:53.218 align:start position:0%
the ability of the courts uh to perform
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
its job and form its its duties
 
05:21:57.770 --> 05:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman if I can just have one
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
second to take a look at my notes from
 
05:22:02.090 --> 05:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
the comments uh just just make sure
 
05:22:03.890 --> 05:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not missing too much I know I'm
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
missing something
 
05:22:06.000 --> 05:22:08.350 align:start position:0%
missing something
um

05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
probably not
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
key but so I'll be happy to stop there
 
05:22:15.170 --> 05:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions thank you for
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
your presentation I'm looking at the
 
05:22:19.850 --> 05:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
history of of this bill as it's loped
 
05:22:21.770 --> 05:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
its way through this committee and also
 
05:22:21.780 --> 05:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
its way through this committee and also
Judiciary

05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary
 
05:22:26.448 --> 05:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
um and it was a bill that didn't make it
 
05:22:28.610 --> 05:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
but it sounds to me like portions of it
 
05:22:31.550 --> 05:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
somehow did make it it has to do with
 
05:22:35.530 --> 05:22:35.540 align:start position:0%
parties recording in court proceedings
 
05:22:38.930 --> 05:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
having notified the courts and other
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
parties they will be recording I think
 
05:22:43.970 --> 05:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that's on the books if I'm
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
not mistaken it's not a statue it's a
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
Court rule it's a Court rule it applies
 
05:22:51.650 --> 05:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
to each each Court a Family Division has
 
05:22:54.170 --> 05:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
that rule so in Family Division it is
 
05:22:58.368 --> 05:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:23:04.730 --> 05:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
I've got a bucket of them representative
 
05:23:09.770 --> 05:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:12.770 --> 05:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman all the letters
 
05:23:16.128 --> 05:23:16.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for testifying
 
05:23:18.240 --> 05:23:19.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for testifying
um

05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
this afternoon uh and
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
your extensive research I appreciate
 
05:23:24.600 --> 05:23:25.550 align:start position:0%
your extensive research I appreciate
that

05:23:25.550 --> 05:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:28.368 --> 05:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
I have one question about a
 
05:23:30.288 --> 05:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
a situation that was brought up
 
05:23:30.298 --> 05:23:31.610 align:start position:0%
a situation that was brought up
concerning

05:23:31.610 --> 05:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
05:23:34.850 --> 05:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
children who testify
 
05:23:37.730 --> 05:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
in the fact that their comments and so
 
05:23:39.650 --> 05:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
forth should be
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
either redacted from written transcript
 
05:23:46.550 --> 05:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
or removed from verbal
 
05:23:49.250 --> 05:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little bit about that
 
05:23:51.650 --> 05:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
truthfully I thank you thank you for the
 
05:23:54.050 --> 05:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
question I would I need to ask some
 
05:23:55.970 --> 05:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
questions to make sure I'm accurate as
 
05:23:59.930 --> 05:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
to uh as to exactly
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
how that how that applies in the
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
transcript there are and what the what
 
05:24:04.910 --> 05:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
the precautions have to be and I'm happy
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
to follow up I don't know the answer I'd
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
be reluctant to say the answer without
 
05:24:11.150 --> 05:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
confirming you can follow up yeah thank
 
05:24:16.010 --> 05:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
I jotted down here the judge has control
 
05:24:19.970 --> 05:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
of the courtroom
 
05:24:22.550 --> 05:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I can understand presiding over a
 
05:24:24.410 --> 05:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
room where you really kind of do want to
 
05:24:26.930 --> 05:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
have control of it but what if the judge
 
05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
is the problem we've heard some stories
 
05:24:30.360 --> 05:24:33.250 align:start position:0%
is the problem we've heard some stories
um

05:24:33.250 --> 05:24:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:35.930 --> 05:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
not most of
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
judges but it seems like more than one
 
05:24:40.850 --> 05:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
so they're
 
05:24:42.650 --> 05:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
um when I think the judges so far
 
05:24:45.050 --> 05:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
referenced are no longer judges
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
um that's not a coincidence and there
 
05:24:48.650 --> 05:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
have been judicial conduct committee
 
05:24:51.410 --> 05:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
proceedings involving those judges I
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
know that so
 
05:24:54.650 --> 05:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
um in
 
05:24:56.810 --> 05:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
at the requester Mr Albrecht I've
 
05:24:59.090 --> 05:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
listened to for example many of the
 
05:25:01.628 --> 05:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
recordings that that relate to
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
his case
 
05:25:06.010 --> 05:25:06.020 align:start position:0%
um with master delpra
 
05:25:06.020 --> 05:25:06.708 align:start position:0%
um with master delpra
[Music]

05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:25:06.718 --> 05:25:07.390 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:25:07.390 --> 05:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:07.400 --> 05:25:08.930 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:25:08.930 --> 05:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:11.868 --> 05:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
my interpretation and I will caveat it
 
05:25:14.090 --> 05:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
with that is that the comments of Master
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
dalpra so these this was also during an
 
05:25:19.250 --> 05:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
era when
 
05:25:19.260 --> 05:25:19.910 align:start position:0%
era when
um

05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:22.010 --> 05:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
things were being done remotely so I
 
05:25:24.288 --> 05:25:24.298 align:start position:0%
believe the my memory is that the
 
05:25:25.788 --> 05:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
recordings that we're talking about were
 
05:25:28.010 --> 05:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
all remote so the parties were not all
 
05:25:30.050 --> 05:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom at the time and that
 
05:25:32.090 --> 05:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
these were comments
 
05:25:35.208 --> 05:25:35.218 align:start position:0%
um inappropriate comments made by Master
 
05:25:35.218 --> 05:25:36.710 align:start position:0%
um inappropriate comments made by Master
delpra

05:25:36.710 --> 05:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
delpra
 
05:25:36.720 --> 05:25:37.310 align:start position:0%

05:25:37.310 --> 05:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:25:37.320 --> 05:25:37.850 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:25:37.850 --> 05:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:40.430 --> 05:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
not quote unquote on the record not to
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
all the parties they were essentially
 
05:25:45.170 --> 05:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
comments he was making to himself and to
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
whoever was like his his clerk in his
 
05:25:52.190 --> 05:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
Chambers or in the courtroom but not as
 
05:25:54.530 --> 05:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
part of the proceeding
 
05:25:56.930 --> 05:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
um one of them was it and I won't get
 
05:25:58.368 --> 05:25:58.378 align:start position:0%
into the specifics but I think that's
 
05:26:00.288 --> 05:26:00.298 align:start position:0%
why it did not make the transcript in
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
the first instance because I believe the
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
transcriptionist interpreted that to me
 
05:26:07.490 --> 05:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
and it was not a part of the record
 
05:26:10.010 --> 05:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
um and what happened in terms of the
 
05:26:11.690 --> 05:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
transcript after that truth I'm not I'm
 
05:26:14.270 --> 05:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
not positive but those are comments that
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
are in the recordings
 
05:26:19.070 --> 05:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and you can find I was unable to find
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
and I actually don't know why
 
05:26:25.250 --> 05:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
um but I was unable to find the can of
 
05:26:27.410 --> 05:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
worms comment that
 
05:26:27.420 --> 05:26:28.390 align:start position:0%
worms comment that
um

05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
that Ms Gerard had mentioned
 
05:26:34.430 --> 05:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and I know that the judicial conduct
 
05:26:36.410 --> 05:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
committee did hear it because they said
 
05:26:39.170 --> 05:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
that in their in their findings I simply
 
05:26:40.970 --> 05:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
was unable to find it but it obviously
 
05:26:43.670 --> 05:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
existed because the uh the judicial
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
conduct committee did
 
05:26:48.288 --> 05:26:48.298 align:start position:0%
um report that they listened to it but
 
05:26:49.970 --> 05:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
beyond that I honestly don't know where
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
that re where that came from or the
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
context of it could I infer then from
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
this testimony that
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
um if different citizens heard a
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
series of inappropriate comments in open
 
05:27:03.840 --> 05:27:04.910 align:start position:0%
series of inappropriate comments in open
court

05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:27:07.550 --> 05:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
there is an appeal process there is a
 
05:27:07.560 --> 05:27:08.810 align:start position:0%
there is an appeal process there is a
complaint

05:27:08.810 --> 05:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
place where people can go and that place
 
05:27:15.708 --> 05:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
is that takes these seriously I I think
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are two things uh one is the
 
05:27:19.368 --> 05:27:19.378 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee obviously if
 
05:27:22.128 --> 05:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
there's misbehavior by a judge that is
 
05:27:24.530 --> 05:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
the appropriate if it's in open court
 
05:27:28.690 --> 05:27:28.700 align:start position:0%
and it raises questions about the
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
impartiality or the ability of the judge
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
to oversee the case there could be
 
05:27:36.170 --> 05:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
emotion in that case asking the judge to
 
05:27:38.628 --> 05:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
recuse him or herself
 
05:27:40.970 --> 05:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:27:44.330 --> 05:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
so you know there are processes
 
05:27:44.340 --> 05:27:45.470 align:start position:0%
so you know there are processes
um

05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
and if somebody believes that the
 
05:27:49.250 --> 05:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
transcript is missing something and they
 
05:27:51.770 --> 05:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
have some evidence of that it can be
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
brought forward and and somebody would
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to listen to the recording but it
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
is ultimately based on the official
 
05:28:00.770 --> 05:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
recording and the official transcript uh
 
05:28:04.010 --> 05:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
and those are the things that
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
um we have control over and that we
 
05:28:08.930 --> 05:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
knows is the official record one other
 
05:28:14.690 --> 05:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
comment we are upgrading our recording
 
05:28:17.690 --> 05:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
system it became evident during the
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic when we were
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
doing remote testimony that our currents
 
05:28:26.990 --> 05:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
are our existing system was unable to
 
05:28:30.770 --> 05:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
record each party who's coming in on one
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
system separately so when people were
 
05:28:36.288 --> 05:28:36.298 align:start position:0%
speaking over each other in our old
 
05:28:38.030 --> 05:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
system they would overlap in the
 
05:28:41.330 --> 05:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
recording also the new system uh primary
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
reason we went out and got it was so
 
05:28:45.948 --> 05:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
that we could Now record each person as
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
a separate Channel and the
 
05:28:49.730 --> 05:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
transcriptionist can then take the turn
 
05:28:51.770 --> 05:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
take the testimony of each individual
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
who's testifying now that we're relying
 
05:28:59.208 --> 05:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
much more on on remote technology that
 
05:29:00.830 --> 05:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
became apparent during the course of the
 
05:29:02.448 --> 05:29:02.458 align:start position:0%
pandemic that that was a need for an
 
05:29:02.458 --> 05:29:04.310 align:start position:0%
pandemic that that was a need for an
upgrade

05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
05:29:06.830 --> 05:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
you may know from the media that I chair
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
a working group on the dealing with
 
05:29:12.650 --> 05:29:12.660 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice claims and their
 
05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
reportage to the public and this is a
 
05:29:18.830 --> 05:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe I understand how
 
05:29:22.010 --> 05:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
finely nuanced all of this has to be
 
05:29:25.850 --> 05:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult job thank you I uh I
 
05:29:25.860 --> 05:29:27.230 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult job thank you I uh I
agree

05:29:27.230 --> 05:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
agree
 
05:29:29.390 --> 05:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
05:29:29.400 --> 05:29:30.770 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Nelson

05:29:30.770 --> 05:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
Nelson
 
05:29:32.930 --> 05:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
um regarding waivers is there any um are
 
05:29:43.850 --> 05:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
there any record and database of uh the
 
05:29:48.170 --> 05:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
actual waivers that judges
 
05:29:48.180 --> 05:29:50.270 align:start position:0%
actual waivers that judges
um

05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
do for lack of better term
 
05:29:55.510 --> 05:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
um so if there was a problem
 
05:29:59.050 --> 05:29:59.060 align:start position:0%
it could be easily recognizable
 
05:30:01.610 --> 05:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
showing a pattern if
 
05:30:03.948 --> 05:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question the answer
 
05:30:06.530 --> 05:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
is the short answer is no
 
05:30:09.350 --> 05:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
um so this the bill you have before you
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
today there were two parts it was two
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
bills last session
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:30:15.718 --> 05:30:16.430 align:start position:0%
um the
um

05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
transcript part of it came out of
 
05:30:21.770 --> 05:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
committee uh unanimous itl the recording
 
05:30:23.990 --> 05:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the waiver part of it came out
 
05:30:26.570 --> 05:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
of it as a new bill which was to create
 
05:30:28.368 --> 05:30:28.378 align:start position:0%
a database
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
um the the problem obviously with any
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
database is it requires input so during
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
the course of a
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
two-day trial three-day trial judges
 
05:30:42.410 --> 05:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
constantly making decisions is
 
05:30:44.690 --> 05:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
constantly uh
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
possibly you know there's a rule that
 
05:30:48.410 --> 05:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
has to be waived judge may not even sort
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
of formally recognize oh I'm I'm waving
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
rule you know 8.2 Part B whatever it's
 
05:30:59.448 --> 05:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
just they know the rule they know what
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
the situation is and they're allowing
 
05:31:02.570 --> 05:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
something to come in where they're
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
allowing something to happen we would
 
05:31:06.890 --> 05:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
have to have either continuous
 
05:31:09.170 --> 05:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
monitoring of every judge all the time
 
05:31:09.180 --> 05:31:12.590 align:start position:0%
monitoring of every judge all the time
or

05:31:12.590 --> 05:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:15.708 --> 05:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
um we just simply don't have a mechanism
 
05:31:18.590 --> 05:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
for inputting all of this type of data
 
05:31:20.330 --> 05:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
that's happening in real time in every
 
05:31:22.730 --> 05:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
courthouse in every courtroom both
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
verbally and in writing so unfortunately
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the the desire for it
 
05:31:31.128 --> 05:31:31.138 align:start position:0%
and the interest in it it is uh it would
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
be a remarkably complicated undertaking
 
05:31:35.868 --> 05:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to do and do well and do
 
05:31:35.878 --> 05:31:37.368 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to do and do well and do
accurately

05:31:37.368 --> 05:31:37.378 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
05:31:39.170 --> 05:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and would require
 
05:31:41.810 --> 05:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of resources
 
05:31:45.530 --> 05:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford
 
05:31:50.930 --> 05:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:31:53.810 --> 05:31:53.820 align:start position:0%

year

05:32:06.170 --> 05:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the end of that that's the
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
end of that
 
05:32:13.788 --> 05:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
um but my how long was uh Metal Master
 
05:32:16.430 --> 05:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
dumpra on the bench um is this to the
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
point of the bill this is getting a
 
05:32:21.470 --> 05:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
little close to uh disciplinary matters
 
05:32:24.050 --> 05:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
that perhaps maybe beyond our scope I
 
05:32:25.490 --> 05:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
was kind of following up what you were
 
05:32:28.788 --> 05:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
you reckon you were going in oh no oh no
 
05:32:30.288 --> 05:32:30.298 align:start position:0%
no practice
 
05:32:32.208 --> 05:32:32.218 align:start position:0%
there is no good answer I can give to
 
05:32:32.218 --> 05:32:33.230 align:start position:0%
there is no good answer I can give to
that

05:32:33.230 --> 05:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:35.090 --> 05:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
continue for the time being just be
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
careful do you know how long a master
 
05:32:39.410 --> 05:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
Delbert was on the bench I don't know
 
05:32:41.930 --> 05:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
exactly it was a he was he had a long
 
05:32:45.288 --> 05:32:45.298 align:start position:0%
tenure uh as a master but 20 years comes
 
05:32:46.368 --> 05:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
to mind but I don't know the answer
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you
 
05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
under rule 1.2 waiver of rules it begins
 
05:32:58.250 --> 05:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
as good cause appears and his Justice
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
may require the Family Division May
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
waive the application of any rule on
 
05:33:05.330 --> 05:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
face value that sounds wonderful it begs
 
05:33:07.970 --> 05:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
the question according to whom who makes
 
05:33:10.368 --> 05:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
the decision that that judge May waive
 
05:33:11.628 --> 05:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
that rule
 
05:33:14.208 --> 05:33:14.218 align:start position:0%
these are all decisions that are being
 
05:33:16.128 --> 05:33:16.138 align:start position:0%
made by the presiding judge so the
 
05:33:18.170 --> 05:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
presiding judge is the determining
 
05:33:21.890 --> 05:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
factor and good cause and Justice in
 
05:33:25.490 --> 05:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
this case he waives the rules he or she
 
05:33:27.050 --> 05:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
chooses to
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct the the as with any
 
05:33:32.690 --> 05:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
any case you know the interpretation of
 
05:33:34.850 --> 05:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
the rules the waiver of the rules and
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
the in the same with the statute is done
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
by the presiding judge based upon the
 
05:33:42.288 --> 05:33:42.298 align:start position:0%
facts evidence information before that
 
05:33:42.298 --> 05:33:43.490 align:start position:0%
facts evidence information before that
judge

05:33:43.490 --> 05:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and that judges is making it making
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
the decisions we don't have a process of
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh waiver committee waiver judge it's
 
05:33:54.530 --> 05:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
it's the judge Who's involved at the
 
05:33:56.930 --> 05:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
time and they could be happening in real
 
05:34:00.050 --> 05:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
time in the courtroom as information is
 
05:34:02.510 --> 05:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
being presented
 
05:34:06.110 --> 05:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
without mentioning names or specifics
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
um but more than as a hypothetical
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
have there been instances where a judge
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
has so
 
05:34:13.440 --> 05:34:15.470 align:start position:0%
has so
missed

05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
missed
 
05:34:18.350 --> 05:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
the idea of good cause or Justice in the
 
05:34:20.810 --> 05:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
waving of rules and done it repeatedly
 
05:34:22.550 --> 05:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
we've all had bad days
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
that uh con some judicial conduct is
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
taken against him or her I don't know
 
05:34:30.410 --> 05:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
the answer to that okay
 
05:34:33.368 --> 05:34:33.378 align:start position:0%
I would not research that specifically
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
would that be something that you sense
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
your profession would do
 
05:34:43.070 --> 05:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
I apologize can you repeat the question
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
I just didn't understand do you
 
05:34:49.368 --> 05:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
would it be would it be likely never to
 
05:34:53.208 --> 05:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
happen that the judicial review I missed
 
05:34:56.270 --> 05:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
the exact conduct command would ever
 
05:35:01.010 --> 05:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
have a situation where judge X has been
 
05:35:03.050 --> 05:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
brought before them because there have
 
05:35:04.910 --> 05:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
been too many complaints that too many
 
05:35:06.830 --> 05:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
rules have been waived and they just do
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
not seem to be for good cause or or as
 
05:35:11.448 --> 05:35:11.458 align:start position:0%
Justice may require in other words this
 
05:35:15.170 --> 05:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
person this judge is misusing the waiver
 
05:35:17.448 --> 05:35:17.458 align:start position:0%
of rules and there is a mechanism where
 
05:35:20.208 --> 05:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
that may be dealt with by one's peers
 
05:35:22.970 --> 05:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so you know I don't know it's it's
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:35:24.718 --> 05:35:26.628 align:start position:0%
you know
parties

05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
parties
 
05:35:29.570 --> 05:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
use the rules in various ways so when a
 
05:35:31.730 --> 05:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
judge waives a rule it may very well
 
05:35:34.490 --> 05:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
upset the other party because that other
 
05:35:37.250 --> 05:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
party may have seen a great Advantage by
 
05:35:38.930 --> 05:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
virtue of the person not filing an
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
appearance on day 15.
 
05:35:44.990 --> 05:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know the the
 
05:35:47.810 --> 05:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
reaction to a waiver of rule can be one
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
of two things one is
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
I really really wanted that rule to be
 
05:35:54.288 --> 05:35:54.298 align:start position:0%
applied as it's written because that was
 
05:35:56.390 --> 05:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
to my uh
 
05:35:59.628 --> 05:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
advantage in litigation I've litigated
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
for over 30 years uh I liked it when the
 
05:36:05.208 --> 05:36:05.218 align:start position:0%
rules Favored Me and when those were
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
waived I recognized that that was
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
disappointing for me that's one aspect
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
of it the other aspect is as you suggest
 
05:36:15.770 --> 05:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
which is there are occasions if a judge
 
05:36:18.470 --> 05:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
is waiving a rule because that judge is
 
05:36:20.690 --> 05:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
biased and wants a particular party to
 
05:36:22.330 --> 05:36:22.340 align:start position:0%
be successful
 
05:36:26.628 --> 05:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
that and and and a a party an attorney
 
05:36:29.930 --> 05:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
anybody believes that to be true the
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
complaint can be filed with the judicial
 
05:36:34.970 --> 05:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
conduct committee my my answer was
 
05:36:36.830 --> 05:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
simply I've never looked through all of
 
05:36:39.368 --> 05:36:39.378 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
complaints to see sort of whether or not
 
05:36:44.570 --> 05:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
these are triggered or whether this is a
 
05:36:47.628 --> 05:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
source of of complaint my interest is
 
05:36:49.610 --> 05:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
twofold the bill at hand and the
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
parallel track that I'm running in terms
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
of malpractice so I'm interested to see
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
fair enough how you doing
 
05:36:58.910 --> 05:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank you
 
05:37:03.530 --> 05:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and now we have one final
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
pink card I will accept no more where
 
05:37:08.448 --> 05:37:08.458 align:start position:0%
over time so
 
05:37:14.410 --> 05:37:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:17.448 --> 05:37:17.458 align:start position:0%
representative for Salem for how many
 
05:37:20.690 --> 05:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
years six six
 
05:37:24.650 --> 05:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
and now in vacationing how was your trip
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
which one the one we didn't take because
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
that was it
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
oh bummer yeah oh I'll go in April okay
 
05:37:34.680 --> 05:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
oh bummer yeah oh I'll go in April okay
um

05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:39.050 --> 05:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
we've all Heard lots of things oh I'm
 
05:37:41.330 --> 05:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
supposed to say your name I kind of
 
05:37:43.190 --> 05:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
introduced this is Betty gay from Salem
 
05:37:46.970 --> 05:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
and six years House Bill 218 with
 
05:37:49.128 --> 05:37:49.138 align:start position:0%
financial evaluation
 
05:37:53.628 --> 05:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
uh actually contains three former bills
 
05:37:56.990 --> 05:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to pass around with passing
 
05:38:00.830 --> 05:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
around the price of a transcript I had
 
05:38:02.050 --> 05:38:02.060 align:start position:0%
to call
 
05:38:04.850 --> 05:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
escribers because they only tell you the
 
05:38:07.250 --> 05:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
price per page you have no idea how many
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
pages it takes but in talking it's not
 
05:38:12.170 --> 05:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
in writing but in talking I found out
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
they estimate 50 pages per hour
 
05:38:16.798 --> 05:38:18.170 align:start position:0%
they estimate 50 pages per hour
okay

05:38:18.170 --> 05:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:38:21.650 --> 05:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
the first price is seven dollars a page
 
05:38:26.270 --> 05:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
so for one hour it's 350 dollars so it's
 
05:38:28.490 --> 05:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
not expensive to get the uh the
 
05:38:30.050 --> 05:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
recordings I didn't even write it down
 
05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
it's 25 or 35 and you pay that and then
 
05:38:36.890 --> 05:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
if you want a CD pay another 25.
 
05:38:39.470 --> 05:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
so that's that's not bad it's the
 
05:38:41.868 --> 05:38:41.878 align:start position:0%
transcripts that cut people out who are
 
05:38:44.448 --> 05:38:44.458 align:start position:0%
not filthy rich or make people who have
 
05:38:46.490 --> 05:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
really great credit run up a hundred
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars there are people here
 
05:38:51.170 --> 05:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
in this room who have spent more like
 
05:38:53.150 --> 05:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand
 
05:38:55.128 --> 05:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
and a friend of mine who couldn't come
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
she became a friend because I was
 
05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
05:39:01.128 --> 05:39:01.138 align:start position:0%
and she contacted me
 
05:39:04.250 --> 05:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
you very wisely pointed out that this
 
05:39:06.530 --> 05:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
needs another paragraph that points out
 
05:39:10.490 --> 05:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
what you can use the recordings for it's
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
just for appellate purposes
 
05:39:12.958 --> 05:39:14.570 align:start position:0%
just for appellate purposes
because

05:39:14.570 --> 05:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:39:14.580 --> 05:39:15.350 align:start position:0%
because
um

05:39:15.350 --> 05:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
so she suggested
 
05:39:23.448 --> 05:39:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
the judge let's see no the two points
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
here she wants to you know make sure
 
05:39:31.368 --> 05:39:31.378 align:start position:0%
that you understand that judge
 
05:39:33.890 --> 05:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
definitely can turn the recording off
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
and on because it happened to her you
 
05:39:37.788 --> 05:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
can watch it happen
 
05:39:40.730 --> 05:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
and when she got her recording of course
 
05:39:45.410 --> 05:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:47.810 --> 05:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
parties let's see where is it that the
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
children she said my daughters want to
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
05:39:53.628 --> 05:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
that uh a personal recording made in
 
05:39:57.970 --> 05:39:57.980 align:start position:0%
court would not be able to be publicized
 
05:40:01.190 --> 05:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
so she said I would like it that parties
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
may only use the recording for court
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
matters and cannot distribute them in
 
05:40:10.550 --> 05:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
any way paper or electronically and if
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
they do some penalty would be assessed
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
in no manner May the transcript be used
 
05:40:19.010 --> 05:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
other than within the judicial system in
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
its entirety I say this because I know
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
my children her two teenage daughters
 
05:40:27.890 --> 05:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
would not want what happened to them
 
05:40:31.128 --> 05:40:31.138 align:start position:0%
out in public or be cherry-picked by
 
05:40:34.010 --> 05:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
parties and used out of context on
 
05:40:35.930 --> 05:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
social media
 
05:40:38.390 --> 05:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
I was really sad she couldn't come but
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
the duties of being a single mother are
 
05:40:43.670 --> 05:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
challenging I'm going to reach you seven
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
points you've already heard so much
 
05:40:48.650 --> 05:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully these will all strike a point
 
05:40:50.510 --> 05:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
into your memory
 
05:40:52.850 --> 05:40:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay the first one was that we really
 
05:40:55.070 --> 05:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
need an amendment that points out what
 
05:40:57.708 --> 05:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
you'd use this recording for
 
05:41:01.368 --> 05:41:01.378 align:start position:0%
two children ordinarily do not get to
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
testify they have no right to testify
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
unless the judge permits it that is a
 
05:41:09.850 --> 05:41:09.860 align:start position:0%
solid rule among these
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
e-scribers prices which is uh you know
 
05:41:15.470 --> 05:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
on the Green Sheet I have the escribers
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
prices and then another company
 
05:41:21.170 --> 05:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
um the point is
 
05:41:25.850 --> 05:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
if that's if the accuracy you know I'm
 
05:41:28.910 --> 05:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
sure you pay a premium when you have a
 
05:41:30.890 --> 05:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
chain of command
 
05:41:33.530 --> 05:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
but the important thing is does the
 
05:41:38.090 --> 05:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
we just discovered she discovered that
 
05:41:43.850 --> 05:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
the East Driver Services their prices
 
05:41:47.690 --> 05:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:49.610 --> 05:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
it won't take long
 
05:41:52.368 --> 05:41:52.378 align:start position:0%
or transcript differences to be
 
05:41:52.378 --> 05:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
or transcript differences to be
recognized

05:41:53.750 --> 05:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
05:41:56.510 --> 05:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Appellate the the Appellate Court
 
05:41:59.868 --> 05:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
for family court in New Hampshire is the
 
05:42:01.368 --> 05:42:01.378 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
05:42:04.010 --> 05:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
you don't get to re-hear your case
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh that's another bill I'd like to see
 
05:42:09.650 --> 05:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
past it used to be that you could go to
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and re-hear your case now
 
05:42:16.190 --> 05:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court just evaluates whether
 
05:42:19.190 --> 05:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
the court followed the right procedures
 
05:42:21.650 --> 05:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
you can't plead the you know I didn't
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
get a chance I was denied an evidentiary
 
05:42:28.128 --> 05:42:28.138 align:start position:0%
hearing I have two friends that I know
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
were denied evidence
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to give it to him so
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't and one judge even said I've
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
already made up my mind I don't need
 
05:42:37.200 --> 05:42:39.350 align:start position:0%
already made up my mind I don't need
evidence

05:42:39.350 --> 05:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
05:42:42.590 --> 05:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
it is no surprise that the courts object
 
05:42:46.250 --> 05:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
to every effort to reform
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
their people like all of us we don't
 
05:42:53.330 --> 05:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
like to be have our errors pointed out
 
05:42:56.270 --> 05:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
and nobody likes change either unless
 
05:42:58.850 --> 05:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
they're the ones controlling it so I'm
 
05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
not surprised that Mr head comes once
 
05:43:05.690 --> 05:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
more to every single one of my bills to
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
tell why it would be terrible
 
05:43:11.208 --> 05:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
but the point is we have such errors
 
05:43:14.690 --> 05:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
going on in court the only way I had to
 
05:43:16.610 --> 05:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
laugh when he said well you just show
 
05:43:19.730 --> 05:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
evidence that this was done how do you
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
show evidence that a recording is
 
05:43:23.868 --> 05:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
inadequate if you don't have a recording
 
05:43:25.610 --> 05:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
to prove it
 
05:43:28.610 --> 05:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
we have lots of incidences of people
 
05:43:31.010 --> 05:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
saying the judge said so and so and so
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
and so I paid my 30 25 35 bucks
 
05:43:37.490 --> 05:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's not in there
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
and you can't appeal
 
05:43:41.448 --> 05:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
you can't appeal it if you don't have
 
05:43:41.458 --> 05:43:46.190 align:start position:0%
you can't appeal it if you don't have
evidence

05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:48.410 --> 05:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
I heard judge Foley's name mentioned
 
05:43:50.270 --> 05:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
earlier so I'm going to say it again
 
05:43:51.770 --> 05:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative we put just about
 
05:43:54.410 --> 05:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
everybody except the maternity head
 
05:43:56.510 --> 05:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
because he was the only one speaking on
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
the other side but I'm I'm going to ask
 
05:44:01.670 --> 05:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
you to speed up okay thank you well a
 
05:44:03.230 --> 05:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
friend of mine who you all know who's
 
05:44:05.090 --> 05:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
very famous and I didn't ask her for
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
permission to call her so I will not
 
05:44:09.350 --> 05:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
quote her name
 
05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
she asked prospective judges she asked
 
05:44:15.128 --> 05:44:15.138 align:start position:0%
current judges
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
and one judge said about Foley oh he
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
says everybody knows if he has the
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
choice to give custody
 
05:44:25.730 --> 05:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
to of children to a mother who's been
 
05:44:28.368 --> 05:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
very good and a father who just spent
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years in prison he's going
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
to give the kids to the the father who
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
just got out of prison
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
I'm really upset that if judges know
 
05:44:41.448 --> 05:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
this know the Prejudice why isn't the
 
05:44:44.030 --> 05:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
JCC responding we have lots of
 
05:44:45.890 --> 05:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
experience with people appealing to The
 
05:44:49.850 --> 05:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
JCC and having the response no finding
 
05:44:53.208 --> 05:44:53.218 align:start position:0%
so please help us you can fix the bill
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
you can fix fine-tune the wording just
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
realize how serious this is and how this
 
05:45:01.850 --> 05:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
impacts people's lives to have no
 
05:45:05.930 --> 05:45:05.940 align:start position:0%

in two weeks we can exec the bill as it
 
05:45:55.430 --> 05:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
stands or it is the choice that based on
 
05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
what was heard today
 
05:46:00.110 --> 05:46:00.120 align:start position:0%

05:46:02.510 --> 05:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
true with all of these bills point of
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
order what I I thought you guys were the
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
only ones who could submit an amendment
 
05:46:09.170 --> 05:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
we can receive it from someone else and
 
05:46:10.850 --> 05:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
put our name on it
 
05:46:13.610 --> 05:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay so it can become our Amendment it
 
05:46:15.470 --> 05:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
