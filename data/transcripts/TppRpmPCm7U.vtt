iterations of looking at the court in
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%

additional members came from various
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups then we were reminded
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
of the 2012 house committee on redress
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%

were made both in the area of changes in
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
procedure and towards specific
 
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.129 align:start position:0%
procedure and towards specific
individuals

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
when I discovered this past weekend and
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
doing some office cleaning was a page
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
describing the family court Forum held
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%

on May 25th of 2016 at the upper Walker
house

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
I recall this meeting because I was
 
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.129 align:start position:0%
I recall this meeting because I was
there

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:42.139 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
individuals were allowed to speak for a
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
maximum of three minutes having
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
previously been coached as to their
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
conduct for the speech by representative
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
then representative Kimberly rice The
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
Forum was moderated by then
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative and now Commissioner of
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
Education Frank edelblue
 
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
among the directions as to content of
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
speeches was this paragraph
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is not and it was in bold face
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
italics a forum for adjudication
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
details of specific cases will not be
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
addressed use of specific names of
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
people should not be used simply State
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
the judge or the clerk or whatever
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
appropriate title applies interestingly
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the way I got this
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee going maybe that was in the
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
back of my mind
 
00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:41.539 align:start position:0%
additionally participants were told
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
individuals are encouraged to submit
 
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
written testimony if they believe three
 
00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
minutes is not enough time in such case
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
use the three minutes to give the
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
highlights of the written testimony and
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
finally the document from then reads
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
individuals speaking are encouraged to
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
share ideas and observations about how
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
the family court system
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
has worked well for them or where there
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
are opportunities for improvement
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned this at some length
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
because this has not been mentioned as
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
we looked at recent history
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
of the previous times When leaders
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
gathered to hear from the public the way
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
we are functioning here is much more
 
00:09:29.449 --> 00:09:29.459 align:start position:0%
similar to this 2016 iteration than the
 
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
two that came before it with a couple of
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions while we do not have
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups among the committee
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
members as the first one did we are
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
affording them times to make
 
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.990 align:start position:0%
affording them times to make
presentations

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
and secondly we are offering five
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
minutes to speak not free
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
calendar we will meet once again next
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
week May 23rd we will not meet the week
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
after that which is the day after
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day we will meet again here on
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%

have three different Family Court venues
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
around the state ready to receive us
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
actual hearings of the day commence
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%

week so members of the committee perhaps
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
could sign up which one they wish to go
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
to lest we all wind up in one place
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%

legislation
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
discover areas where changes in
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
procedure or changes in the law
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the Family Division of the
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court might be made
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this special committee is
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
not to retry the cases of citizens who
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
disagree with the outcome of litigation
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
members of the public will be given the
 
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and present
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
information to the committee because of
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
the number of people who may wish to
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
testify there may be a time limit
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
imposed on each person testifying which
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
is permissible under house world 100.
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter for
 
00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:09.019 align:start position:0%
testifying will be limited to specific
 
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.500 align:start position:0%
instances of where there seem to be
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
irregularastifying about subject matter
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
related to a court case or who submit
 
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
documentation related to a court case
 
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
should know that both will be made part
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
of the public record
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
therefore subject matter that is either
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
confidential or may be under seal should
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
not be discussed or submitted to the
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
committee as disclosure of such matters
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of Statute or of a
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
court order
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
the committee reserves the right not to
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
accept written or oral testimony or
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
materials which would in its judgment
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
violate the foregoing
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
so with our little opening boilerplates
 
00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:55.490 align:start position:0%
so with our little opening boilerplates
we

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
we

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
of the directors on the board of
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
directors for 603 legal aid which you
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
know is the legal services organization
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
that provides legal representation and
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
education to qualifying low-income
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
people and prior to 603 legal aid which
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
was established two years ago one of its
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
predecessor organizations was the pro
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
bono referral system which I was a board
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
member on that Organization for about 20
 
00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:22.930 align:start position:0%
member on that Organization for about 20
years

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:22.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
and lastly I was appointed by the New
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court as a
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner on its access to Justice
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
Commission and I've been on that
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
commission since 2007. I have experience
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
both in working in court and working
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
with families as well as being involved
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
with some of these stakeholder
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
organizations and I'm hopefully going to
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
provide you with some information and
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
some resources that may be of assistance
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
to the committee you know I know as
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson mentioned and one
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
of the purposes of the committee is to
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
investigate some irregularities and it
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
seems like perhaps some of the
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
complaints that have come from the
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
public involve some of the court rules
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
and the Rules of Evidence
 
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
some of the self-represented litigants
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
as well as some of us attorneys
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
sometimes have difficulties with
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
application of those rules to their
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
particular case type or the particular
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
facts of their case so I wanted to give
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
the committee some examples today so for
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
example the Family Division circuit
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
court has a rule it's Rule 1.28 and it
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
involves what's called an offer of proof
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
and an offer of proof that court is a
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
statement or a representation made by an
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
attorney or a presentation yes sir
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this in written form
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
I can submit it afterwards I'd really
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate if we could get 11 copies of
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
this because I write pretty fast but
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
you're really making some good Forward
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
Motion here and let me know if I'm
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
speaking too quickly I've accused of
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
that um a few times in my life I would
 
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.650 align:start position:0%
that um a few times in my life I would
attest

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
um so the Family Division rule 1.28
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
involves these offers of proof and it
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
involves presentations not testimony but
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
presentations made by an attorney or
 
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
made by a litigant who is representing
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
himself or herself at court so for
 
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
example that specific Court rule says
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the court can exercise its
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
discretion when receiving evidence
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
through an offer of proof
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
one thing that the rule also says is
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
that if an attorney or a
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
self-represented person is going to make
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
a presentation about something that a
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
another witness would testify to
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
or something that a document they want
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
to present that was drafted by a third
 
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
person that third person or witness must
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
be in the courtroom and the court pretty
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
rigidly adheres to that rule so for
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
example lots of times my clients want to
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
give me copies of Facebook page or
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
printed out text messages that somebody
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
else sent them this Court rule would
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
require that whoever's Facebook page
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
that document came from or whoever's
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
printed out text messages came from they
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
would need to be sitting in the
 
00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
courtroom and there's a good reason for
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
that prior to this rule being initiated
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys and self-represented litigants
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
could submit whatever documents they
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
want affidavits signed by family members
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
affidavits signed by other Witnesses but
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that person did not need to be in the
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
courtroom well now the Court rule says
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
You must be there in order so the other
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
side the respondent could cross-examine
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
and that witness about that piece of
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
evidence you want to submit so it is one
 
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
rule that the court is very stringent
 
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
rule that the court is very stringent
about

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes depending on the record if
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's for example a police report or a
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
hospital record maybe the judge uses his
 
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
or her discretion to say I don't need
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
that person in the courtroom it's an
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
official record by the police department
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
or it's an official record by you know
 
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes records are not submitted for
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
the reason they exist so for example if
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
I wanted to submit a record somebody's
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
Hospital record maybe I don't want the
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
judge to use that record in order to
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
show what happened at the hospital I
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
want that record to show the date that
 
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
they were in the hospital because
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
somebody might say well you weren't at
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
your work that day and I would say to
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
the judge look here's the record that
 
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
shows they were at the hospital but I
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't need that record to show what
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
actually happened at the hospital so
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
this rule says that the per if you're
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
going to make a representation by a
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
third party or a third party record they
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
need to be in the court room in order to
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
have them cross-examine
 
00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:57.950 align:start position:0%
have them cross-examine
um

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence oh sorry there's
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
also enough could we stop for a minute
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
here for a question
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and thank you
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just wanted to
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
clarify so if it's a text message or a
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
Facebook post would it just be the
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
person that was you know screenshotting
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
such evidence that would need to be
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
there like so say somebody had sent me a
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
text message would it just need to be me
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
that was in the courtroom are you saying
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
that also the person who wrote me the
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
text message would need me to the
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
important she wanted to clarify no
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it's a good
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
distinction so if somebody sent it to
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
you they would not have to be there
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
because you could testify yourself that
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
you received that text message it's if
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
you want to send someone else's text
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
message or someone else's Facebook page
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
or a document that the school nurse
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
wrote or a teacher wrote a third person
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
other than yourself having that
 
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.890 align:start position:0%
other than yourself having that
experience

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
um there also are the is a Court rule
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
and and again I'm just going to give you
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
the number it is Rule
 
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
2.19 and that particular Court rule says
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
that prior to an initial Hearing in a
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
family court matter that evidence
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
proposed orders
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
Financial affidavits must be submitted
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
seven days ahead of time
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
and the judges are very strictly
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
adhering to that rule so for example I
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
can tell you I had my own experience of
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
I submitted documents six days before a
 
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
hearing and the other attorney was upset
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
that he didn't have them seven days
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and the court continued
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
the hearing with good reason so that
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
people can have time to look and vet the
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
information so oftentimes when people
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
are representing themselves they're not
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
realizing that they have these rules
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
that they have to comply with and when
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
they get to court sometimes the judges
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
are denying them submitting their
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and documents because they
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
haven't followed the Court rule to
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
submit them seven days ahead of time
 
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.100 align:start position:0%
um The Rules of Evidence
 
00:23:02.049 --> 00:23:02.059 align:start position:0%
as this committee may know do not have
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
technically strict
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
application in family law cases the
 
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
rules are applied on a limited basis
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
some particular case types like domestic
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
violence there is a particular rule that
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
says that the Rules of Evidence don't
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
apply I do not do a lot of domestic
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
violence work but I'm aware of that rule
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
there are New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
cases going back decades to the 1950s or
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
earlier that talk about holding that the
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence don't have a strict
 
00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:36.299 align:start position:0%
application in these type of family law
 
00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:37.370 align:start position:0%
application in these type of family law
cases

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
and despite that rule that the Rules of
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
Evidence are not rigidly applied the
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
court does follow two rules rather
 
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.270 align:start position:0%
court does follow two rules rather
strenuously

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
strenuously
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
first is the rule of relevance something
 
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
has to be relevant to the case
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
or relevant to the facts and the second
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
rule is hearsay and as I just talked
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
about that rule 1.28 when you make an
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
offer of proof or you're going to talk
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
about something else somebody said that
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
person has to be in the courtroom
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
I have not personally seen the courts
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
avoid following the court rules
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
it's my experience that the court
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
applies the rules evenly to both
 
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:21.620 align:start position:0%
attorneys and non-attorney litigants
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
and the rules obviously are applied very
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
factually to the case and they're
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
applied depending on the case type and
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
there's a good reason for that the
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
reason that in my opinion the court
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
rules can't be uh sorry the Rules of
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
Evidence can't be rigidly applied it's
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
because the court
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
has to be able to weigh that evidence as
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
the finder of fact they have to be able
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
to give appropriate weight to a
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
particular piece of evidence like I
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
talked about maybe I don't want the
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
hospital record to be submitted into
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
evidence for the actual what happened at
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
the hospital maybe I want to use the
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
date and so the judge is permitted under
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
the court rules to give the appropriate
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
weight to certain pieces of evidence to
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
certain testimony and documents for
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
example to make a ruling that's in the
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
best interest of a child or a victim of
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are also lots of statutes that
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
sort of give the court this discretion
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
as well one of them that I can think of
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
in particular is RSA
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
461-a colon six
 
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
and it's the best interest standard
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
um for a child
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
and it provides a list of what the court
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
can consider when determining what's in
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
a child's best interest so to interrupt
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
you it's not completely arbitrary the
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
best interests of the child is not a go
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
for it judge there are some parameters
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
set out in 461. absolutely thank you
 
00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:56.029 align:start position:0%
set out in 461. absolutely thank you
absolutely

00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and as I'm talking about the Rules of
 
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.909 align:start position:0%
um and as I'm talking about the Rules of
Evidence

00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
Port rules you know for example maybe
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
someone's making an argument in court
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
that a child's home is inappropriate and
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
someone wants to submit photographs of
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
the home to show that it is appropriate
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
or that it's fine but that particular
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
statute has a list of things that the
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
court needs to consider and this is why
 
00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:19.010 align:start position:0%
court needs to consider and this is why
um

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
at least I and maybe others in the
 
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:23.220 align:start position:0%
committee have been told by
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
people high up in the Judiciary that
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
we we as the legislature not only have
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
the right but may have the specific
 
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:36.539 align:start position:0%
interest to to work on some of those
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
that pertain to family law cases too
 
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
voluminous for me to talk about I know
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
you all are aware of but to me there's
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
three main statutes that that this
 
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
committee may want to take a look at or
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
you know self-represented um people who
 
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
go to court the three main statutes in
 
00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:04.580 align:start position:0%
my mind are RSA
 
00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:08.059 align:start position:0%
461-a which is the parenting statute
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
RSA 458 which is the divorce law statute
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
and also applies to unwed
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
um parents and RSA 458-c which is the
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
child support statute
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
and in talking about all these rules
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
um the committee may know that there's
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
been a weighted case study by the New
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court that showed the
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
need for 32 more clerical staff and 18
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
more judges in all of the circuit courts
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
including Family Division I did a little
 
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:44.900 align:start position:0%
bit of research and it was actually
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
astounding to me that on the court
 
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.070 align:start position:0%
astounding to me that on the court
website

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
um in 2022
 
00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:53.900 align:start position:0%
there were over 15
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
600 new cases filed in just the Family
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
Division and when I say new cases I mean
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
cases that are not reopened not
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
modification cases not modifying and
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
existing parenting plan or not modifying
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
child support of those cases over 7 000
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
cases were divorce and parenting cases
 
00:28:17.769 --> 00:28:17.779 align:start position:0%
new cases on average that's
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
587 cases new cases per month and there
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
were over 3 800 domestic violence cases
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
alone that's 321 new domestic violent
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
cases not extension of the domestic
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
violence or um or anything else that had
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
to do with filing again in a case brand
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
the lack of delay or the lack of
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
consistency relates to there's not
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
enough judges and equally important
 
00:28:56.649 --> 00:28:56.659 align:start position:0%
there's not enough clerical staff
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
because of my length of time in working
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
in the court system in the olden days
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'll call it I remember going to court
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
where Court would start at nine o'clock
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
and then at 12 o'clock there would be a
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
break and then Court would start again
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
at 1 30 and everybody knew that but it's
 
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.250 align:start position:0%
at 1 30 and everybody knew that but it's
not

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
um unusual
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
for court cases now to start at 8 A.M
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
right when the doors open It's Not
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
Unusual and I have been involved in
 
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
divorce trials where the judge will say
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to work through lunch
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
because I've got two other ex parte
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
hearings I need to hear after this
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
um I hear and talk with judges that tell
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
me that they're working on nights in
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
weekends to draft their orders and I
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
never 15 years ago would hear of those
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of things
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
as important as I mentioned is when the
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
judges make those orders now there's not
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
enough Court staff to process those
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
orders so the court tries very hard it's
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and again I don't intend to be an
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
expert about court process
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
um at the clerk's office but it's my
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
understanding the courts work really
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
hard to get orders out within 30 days
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's not possible because
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's just a lack of court court staff
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
during covid and I don't know if it's
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
still consistent now at one point the
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
court was down 30 percent in the clerk's
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
office that's huge
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
um they don't the judges don't have
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
enough writing time because every second
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
of their day is packed with hearing
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
cases for example if I have a divorce
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
trial starting at 9 00 a.m oftentimes
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
I'll get there and the bailiff will say
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
sit outside the courtroom the judge has
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
to hear an ex parte an emergency hearing
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
or there's a domestic violence case that
 
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
got filed and now my trial doesn't start
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
till 10 o'clock and my clients lose that
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
time as well well because now we've lost
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
an hour just because there was an
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
emergency that nobody could anticipate
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
or nothing could happen
 
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
or nothing could happen
um

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
again I don't intend to be an expert on
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
the court process but for example every
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
time a domestic violence case is filed
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
the it is filed by the victim the court
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
has to stop what it's doing to manage
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
that case so for example in the already
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled day of the judge now they have
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
to read that petition or perhaps talk
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
with the victim before they issue an ex
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
parte order once the judge issues that
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
order the order goes down to the clerk's
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
office and the clerks have to stop what
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're working on in order to process
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
that and when I say process they have to
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
enter that domestic violence order into
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
several databases as I understand it
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
including the National Crime information
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
center and other New Hampshire
 
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.430 align:start position:0%
center and other New Hampshire
Registries

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
Registries
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
they have to issue an order to the
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
defendant they have to contact the
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
sheriff to serve that order they have to
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
schedule a hearing within 30 days as the
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
mandates of the domestic violence law
 
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.190 align:start position:0%
mandates of the domestic violence law
state

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
the defendant can request a hearing in
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
five days so now if they had a hearing
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
scheduled and the defendant wants to
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
request a sooner hearing they have to
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
squish that hearing into a five-day
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
window because of the statute so you can
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
see that there's an overlay of the
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
Court's day is scheduled and then some
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
emergencies sometimes happen which cause
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
also further delays
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
and of course the divorce and parenting
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
cases and the child support cases and
 
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
the guardianship cases they all have the
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
same requirements of scheduling notices
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
and notifying the respondent and
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
scheduling a hearing
 
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.409 align:start position:0%
scheduling a hearing
um

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
I have been in court for example
 
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
recently to schedule final hearings and
 
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
the judges are saying we don't have any
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
days at all to schedule until the end of
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
the year or the beginning of next year
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
so having judges in the court staff and
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
I know it's an issue of money but it's
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
important to keep the process going with
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
the correct amount of judges and Court
 
00:32:58.970 --> 00:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
staff to deal with that I want the
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
committee to know there are a number of
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
helpful reports in data and perhaps you
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
already do know that on the New
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judicial branch website the
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
reports are broken down by the courts
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're broken down sometimes by the
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
cases in case types so that's a really
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
helpful resource
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and I know chairman Pearson you
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep this committee positive
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and there's so many members of the
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
public who who need resources and
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's things that they can do to
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
educate themselves and get this
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
information so I want to talk a little
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
um some underutilized resources from my
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
perspective you know there's a lot of
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
barriers to the access to justice but
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
there also are a lot of underutilized
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
resources that I think can help so again
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
the court website is terrific
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
there is a link on the court website
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
that's called self-help and on that link
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
members of the public and attorneys
 
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
because I use them too we can find
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
videos about what to expect at court how
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
to file a domestic violence case how to
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
file your divorce case
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
um information about first appearance
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
which is an informational session for
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
parents with children under the age of
 
00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
18. there are checklists there are links
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
to the court rules to the law library
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
both the state law library and the
 
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce UNH School of Law
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
Library Lawyer Referral Services legal
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
aid and most importantly all the court
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
forms I printed out just for myself
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to take a look at it
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
for example if you wanted to see a

Commission I am aware of some of their
 
00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:36.380 align:start position:0%

membership and on the commission and I
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to just talk briefly about some
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
of those initiatives that the access to
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
Justice Commission is working on for
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
example the commission has worked on a
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
pilot project which has started already
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
called Court Navigators there's one
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
Navigator in Nashua in the Circuit Court
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
in Nashua there's another navigator that
 
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
floats around to the other circuit
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
courts and again it's a pilot project
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
and those Court Navigators assist the
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
public in how to file their cases and
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%

the Navigator program as well as
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
educating what we're going to call
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
public Navigators members of the public
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
who might want to volunteer to be a
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
navigator to help people
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
the other projects that the initiative
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
are working on is simplifying and
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
translating court forms there are a lot
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
of people who have a barrier to Justice
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
because of their language barriers so
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
we're working on that we're going to
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
expand the Navigator program there's
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
some initiatives for alternative dispute
 
00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:06.609 align:start position:0%
some initiatives for alternative dispute
resolution

00:39:06.609 --> 00:39:06.619 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a portal for the
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
legal Navigators and a virtual Court
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
Center and then the commission is also
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
going to collect some data to measure
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
its impacts and success on these
 
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.670 align:start position:0%
its impacts and success on these
projects

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
the access to justice has its own
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
current task force that deal with having
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
or assisting those with disability
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the commission also um and I have
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
been personally involved in a pilot
 
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.230 align:start position:0%
been personally involved in a pilot
program

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
um to help work with public libraries
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
the commission probably knows that a lot
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
of members of the public seek out the
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
libraries for not just their computers
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
um in the internet but actually talk to
 
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
the Librarians and ask them for
 
00:39:55.849 --> 00:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
information about how to deal with their
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
cases so we're working on a project to
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
educate those Librarians and doing
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
public presentations to do things like
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
how do you draft a will how do you file
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
your small claims case things like that
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of great projects that
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
the access to Justice Commission is
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
working on
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
you can also as a committee go on to the
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
access to Justice website which is part
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch website and see
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
their reports for civil legal needs in
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you can also see their
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
annual reports which are listed there
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
and there's just so many projects that
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
they're working on at two voluminous to
 
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
discuss here but those reports are
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
really helpful
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the committee has heard
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
previous testimony that 80 percent
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
of every family law case in the circuit
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
court has at least
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
one self-represented individual if not
 
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%

00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
um and the law in the domestic violence
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh sorry Domestic Relations area is
 
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:03.980 align:start position:0%
complex you know for example
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants are expected
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
to draft their decree of divorce about
 
00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:12.619 align:start position:0%
how to divide their retirement accounts
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I work as a consultant for some
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
other attorneys to draft those special
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
documents to divide retirement accounts
 
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:22.820 align:start position:0%
in their complex
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of stakeholders in
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire working really hard to
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
help those people who want to represent
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
themselves or who need to represent
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
themselves and I know I've only skimmed
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
the tip of the iceberg this morning so
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a breath first
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
this was incredible thank you
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg you'll go first
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
because Mr chairman
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
get a pass thank you so much this has
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
been super informative I really
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so in the area of domestic
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
violence which has got more
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
complications than I think we have
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
people in the state
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
um is there a particular resource that's
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
available for pro-say litigants and that
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
I know that's even more complicated when
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's Pro Se given the Dynamics of that
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
but for both sides like where um what
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
are the resources really for them is it
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
the bar association or it's a really
 
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
good question thank you for that
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
um to me the number one resource is a
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
project called the dove project d-o-v-e
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Bar Association
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
and they help victims of domestic
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
violence connect up with an attorney and
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
they do that quickly and I'm really
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
happy to say that there are a lot of New
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorneys that take those
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
cases if a case is scheduled within five
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
days I mean sometimes you have very
 
00:42:47.569 --> 00:42:47.579 align:start position:0%
little time to prepare as an attorney or
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
as a litigant to go to that case so
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's number one people can also go to
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
places like um the YWCA there's places
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
like um in Nashua for example Bridges
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
which is a place that helps domestic
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
violence victims but I would always
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
recommend that they call the New
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association that Dove
 
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
project they work very quickly and try
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
to find people in attorney very fast
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's difficult in domestic violence
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
cases because again I don't practice
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
them very often at all but
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
victims are limited to what they say in
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
their petition so it's really important
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
when they draft that petition to make
 
00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
sure that they have all the facts that
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
they want to say in there otherwise
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
they're precluded by the court rules and
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence protocols from
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
talking about things outside the scope
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
of their petition so it's helpful if
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
even if they could just meet with an
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
attorney to help them craft their
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
petition it would help them a lot
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you so much you're
 
00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.010 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you so much you're
welcome

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you this is
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
very helpful uh with respect to uh the
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
submission of evidence seven days is
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
that calendar days or calendar days it
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
is calendar days yeah obviously if it
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
falls on a weekend then it goes to that
 
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
Monday yes
 
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.430 align:start position:0%
Monday yes
Okay so

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.870 align:start position:0%
Okay so
so

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:12.589 --> 00:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up I may if it was a um so if
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
it's Friday
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Sunday is two days
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a fried if it's the seventh day
 
00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:22.859 align:start position:0%
is on a Friday it would be due on a
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
Friday but let's say that day seven was
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
on Saturday then it would go to the
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
um we're all exhausted I assume you are
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
also because it was an incredible
 
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.970 align:start position:0%
also because it was an incredible
presentation

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.650 align:start position:0%
presentation
um

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
you must be a member of the Bar
 
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.550 align:start position:0%
you must be a member of the Bar
Association

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.870 align:start position:0%
Association
yes

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that differs
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
in other states is that not true
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
it does differ and I I wish I could
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
answer your question about how many
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
states require Bar Association
 
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.210 align:start position:0%
states require Bar Association
um

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh that people uh join their Bar
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
Association the number of states where
 
00:45:26.569 --> 00:45:26.579 align:start position:0%
it is mandatory not just New Hampshire
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh if I could just follow up
 
00:45:29.819 --> 00:45:30.650 align:start position:0%
uh if I could just follow up
um

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
in that case if I wanted to be
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
casual about it I would say that the bar
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
association in effect becomes a wholly
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
owned subsidiary of the court system
 
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.930 align:start position:0%
owned subsidiary of the court system
um

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
does that relationship
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
potentially interfere in any way with
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
not individual attorneys but the
 
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.589 align:start position:0%
not individual attorneys but the
association

00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:03.260 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
so the bar association was created by
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
um and I I can't remember the year I
 
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
should know that year but I believe it
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
was in the 1970s so we are a creation of
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
um the bar association has its own
 
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
bylaws it has its own rules and it has
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
its own way to function even though we
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
were created by the New Hampshire
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court so I believe that the bar
 
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
association has a good relationship with
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
the court system But to answer your
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
question can the bar association
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
challenge or request changes to the
 
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
court rules
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
welcome to allergy season thank you for
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you care to comment on
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've had testimony from prosely
 
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.590 align:start position:0%
we've had testimony from prosely
litigants

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
litigants
 
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.849 align:start position:0%
litigants
[Music]

00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
concerned about their
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
orders being fair and
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways that maybe arguments that
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
that could have been presented to make
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
those orders more fair I'm wondering is
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
it the judge's responsibility to come up
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
with arguments
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
for peruse litigants or is that
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
something that say litiken is just
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
accepting that they
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
may not
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
have the full opportunity for all the
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
laws to be applied to their case if they
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
don't bring it forward I appreciate your
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you one thing that I do
 
00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
as an attorney and I think I have a lot
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
of clients that will come to see me and
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
they they want to represent themselves
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
in court but they come to me just
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
looking for some advice the one thing
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
that I think is very very important is
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
having your proposed orders ready seven
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
days before a hearing and when I prepare
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
myself I go through those forms and say
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay I need to talk about parenting or
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
the parenting schedule or I need to talk
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
about health insurance and a divorce all
 
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
right so if a self-represented person
 
00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:23.339 align:start position:0%
would go through those proposed orders
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
and and just make a list of everything
 
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
they actually wanted to talk about
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
because I know it's daunting it's
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
nerve-wracking when you're in court and
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
representing yourself and trying to
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
remember everything but just being able
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
to go over what proposals you might be
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
requesting of the judge will help bring
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
those to the judge's attention I would
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
also say that when people are
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
self-represented I have seen the judges
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
often ask them some questions to bring
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
out the information
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's not the judge's place in my opinion
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
to make the arguments for the person but
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
they will ask the questions that the
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
court needs to hear the answers to in
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
order to make those orders
 
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and so it's that's sort of my two two
 
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
place answer to to basically say having
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
your proposals ready for court is really
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
helpful because it gets your mind in a
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
place of what you need to discuss and
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
then the judge will sometimes ask those
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
when I thought it would be a good idea
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
to print out the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.710 align:start position:0%
to print out the New Hampshire Rules of
Evidence

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
Evidence
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
but there's uh I don't know if it's
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
Cliff Notes but it is New Hampshire
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence uh they're listing
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
rule 100 103 1.2 1.28 which you spoke to
 
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:49.940 align:start position:0%
and 2.2
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
which I believe the person who prepared
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
this for me thinks uh perhaps correctly
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
this is specifically to family court is
 
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
there a longer document than this that
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
is specifically to family court
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question uh chairman
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
so on the court website
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
the court rules are there with um which
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
is which is really great
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
um within a searchable index
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
and so there are general rules of the
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
circuit court that apply to all the
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
circuit court cases and then you can go
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
down into
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
um into the um the section that just
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
deals with the domestic relation rules
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
and they break them down juvenile cases
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
guardianship cases but yes you can see
 
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
just the rules specific to the family
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
court thank you I'm reading here rule
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
2.2 application of New Hampshire Rules
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
of Evidence the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
Evidence do not apply
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
to the actions
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
listed above however the court in its
 
00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:58.790 align:start position:0%
listed above however the court in its
discretion

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
May utilize the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
Evidence so far this seems to track with
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
what a lot of people are objecting to
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
they don't follow the rules of evidence
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
no they don't have to
 
00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.210 align:start position:0%
no they don't have to
but

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
it continues
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
the the discretion May utilize the New
 
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:22.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rules of Evidence to enhance
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
predictability orderly fair and reliable
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
presentation of evidence so there does
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
seem to be some narrowing so those who
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
would think uh family court has has to
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
follow all of this are missing the point
 
00:51:42.609 --> 00:51:42.619 align:start position:0%
but if in their opinion
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
the judge did not follow the rules of
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
evidence even though in the objector's
 
00:51:49.559 --> 00:51:50.870 align:start position:0%
evidence even though in the objector's
opinion

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
it would have enhanced the predictable
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
orderly fair and reliable presentation
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a beef
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a valid objection
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
would that be a fair narrowing of the
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
objections that are sometimes made that
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
a judge does not follow rules of
 
00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:15.290 align:start position:0%
a judge does not follow rules of
evidence

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
I I do
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
if the court pretty much always follows
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
the rules of relevance in hearsay
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
um and I've talked about that I think it
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
would be difficult for
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature to
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
to make us a a rule that says that the
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence in family law cases
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
must apply because I think that takes
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
away some of the discretion of the
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
judges to get to what might be in the
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
best interest of a child or get what
 
00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:48.839 align:start position:0%
might be in the best interest of a
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
family sometimes people have to the
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
judge may have to look at a piece of
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
evidence that doesn't strictly adhere to
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence in order to get to
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
um a decision including in domestic
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
violence cases where those hearings
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
happen so quickly and if we're going to
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
have every witness there or we're going
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
to comply with the rules that five-day
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
rule in order to have that domestic
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
violence victim be able to be entitled
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
to a hearing might not be able to be
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
adhered to so I appreciate that and I
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
understand that but in my experience I I
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
don't think the judges just take every
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence it has to be relevant
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
it has to follow that rule of hearsay
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
and it has to be related to either the
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
facts or the case at hand not just
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
something unrelated see this is where
 
00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to help those who bring
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
testimony to narrow it because if it's
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
just some broad assertion they don't
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
follow the rules that is not helpful to
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
us it's not helpful to their cause
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
so if we can narrow narrow narrow to
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
those parameters you have spoken of and
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
then we are presented with documentation
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
that perhaps within those rules those
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
that parameter you gave it wasn't
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
followed then I want to see how
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
frequently is that is that something
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody having a bad day did somebody
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
make a mistake which we all do or is
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
this more widespread and if it is then
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
what do we do because I think I agree
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
with you passing a law on this wouldn't
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
be the right way to fix the problem but
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the right way is and
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
you know chairman I would also take a
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
look at some of the New Hampshire
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases there are multiple
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
cases that talk about why the The Rules
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
of Evidence don't rigidly imply in
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
family law cases and as I mentioned
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
before some of them going back to the
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
1950s and those cases have been followed
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
over and over again by the New Hampshire
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but some of the dicta and
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
some of the reason things in those cases
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
I think would be helpful for the
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we could have some of those
 
00:55:01.619 --> 00:55:03.890 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we could have some of those
found

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
that was a yes
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
after the 52 other projects I've dumped
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
on you
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you this is again a slightly
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
different question
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
um for very understandable reasons
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
when our sessions move to the last part
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the morning and we hear from
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
individuals not people here representing
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
agencies or institutions
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
no one has come to say we think the
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
family court is absolutely fabulous
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
everyone who has come is someone who
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
feels that they were not treated justly
 
00:55:56.819 --> 00:55:59.030 align:start position:0%
feels that they were not treated justly
and

00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
the the individual on the other side in
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
their case is not here
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
so we are not an appellate court and we
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
know intention of being an appellate
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
court but it means that we might lose
 
00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:17.870 align:start position:0%
court but it means that we might lose
our

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
our
um

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
ability to discern what really is
 
00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:24.859 align:start position:0%
happening in Family Court
 
00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
are we hearing from 50 percent of the
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
cases are we here or is what we're
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
hearing representing 50 of the cases or
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
25 or 10 or 5
 
00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.130 align:start position:0%
25 or 10 or 5
um

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
we have no way of knowing that
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
in the court
 
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.270 align:start position:0%
in the court
um

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
perception

00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
perception
 
00:57:03.609 --> 00:57:03.619 align:start position:0%
of what actually is happening
 
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in the court in no way
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
minimizing the pain and anguish that
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
um

00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
family court cases are of course some of
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
the most difficult you know and I have
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
been involved in a lot of difficult
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
cases parents that are doing the best
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
for their kids parents that are you know
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
struggling with alcohol abuse or drug
 
00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.609 align:start position:0%
struggling with alcohol abuse or drug
abuse

00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I think the court has
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
done which has been really helpful over
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
the the last oh gosh I don't know it's
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
changed a lot early on in my career the
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
court might make an order where somebody
 
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
files a motion and that motion the the
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
court order might just come back with
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
the word denied no explanation no
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
discussion about what happened the
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
courts try really hard now to make very
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
detailed orders they refer to the
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
statute that they looked at
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
um sometimes they include the statute in
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
the court order they'll talk a lot about
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
the facts you know I can think of a lot
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
of cases where I'm involved in where the
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
judge has said that this person
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
testified to this or this attorney said
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
this and put those facts in the court
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
order so over time I feel that the
 
00:58:21.609 --> 00:58:21.619 align:start position:0%
courts have worked really hard to make
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
more detailed court orders with more
 
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
detailed reasons and rationales for why
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
they're making an order so those final
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
orders or those orders on motions have
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
been a lot more detailed and so I think
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the committee may want to
 
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:38.579 align:start position:0%
take a look at some of those court
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
orders where they can see what the judge
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
has done and given the rationale for why
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
they've made that decision and sometimes
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
as I've said this morning it's a matter
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
of somebody not not reading the rule or
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
not knowing how a rule applies to their
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
case or not understanding that where
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they've lost something because the
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
rule wasn't followed or the statute the
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
burden under a statute wasn't met but I
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
think the courts work very hard to make
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
very detailed orders to explain their
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
rationale when they're making a decision
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that is something that has changed
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you if I could just follow up do
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
you have any um
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
can you generally suggest
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
um that most people who go through the
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
family court system
 
00:59:33.359 --> 00:59:35.089 align:start position:0%
family court system
um

00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
feel that they have not been treated
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
well or half of the people or
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
25 percent or
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
is there any obviously I don't mean a
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
specific number but what we hear
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
is all focused in one way and I need we
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
need to have some sense of perspective
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that I can honestly say
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
from my own perspective I have never
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
seen a judge be disrespectful to a
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant matter of fact
 
01:00:13.809 --> 01:00:13.819 align:start position:0%
some of us attorneys sometimes complain
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
that excuse some attorneys complain that
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes the self-represented litigant
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
is given more time to talk or more time
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
to testify in order to get that in there
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure you know I can tell that
 
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
there are people that feel differently
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
but I have not seen it I had a two-day
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
trial last fall with a gentleman who
 
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
represented himself for two days in
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
court and the court
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
gay he did a great job and the court
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
gave him all the time he needed to be
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
able to have his Witnesses and his
 
01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
able to have his Witnesses and his
testimony

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
um and I didn't see any disrespect from
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
from the judge in that case and I have
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
not seen the judges yell at
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants or or treat
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
them disrespectfully they may they may
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
try to shorten what they say sometimes
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
because they're either getting to a
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
place where something's irrelevant or
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
something's not applicable but I have
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
representative catab
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
e thank you chairman Pearson I just
 
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of follow up on what you
 
01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:24.260 align:start position:0%
just said just to ask a further question
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
do you practice specifically in certain
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
courts or do you typically go to all of
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
the courts because perhaps some of the
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
issues that people are experiencing may
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
just have been at a court that you
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't typically practice that so it's
 
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
just trying to you know ascertain where
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
you typically practice or if you go to
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
all the courts thank you so mostly
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
because I'm in Nashville I mostly
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
practice in the Nashua and Merrimack
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
family divisions but I'm also in Dairy
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
Family Division Salem Concord I don't
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
tend to go too far north
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
um because it's not sustainable for
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
clients to hire me that far away but I
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
have cases in Keene so I do practice in
 
01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
a number of the Family Division courts
 
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
attorney candelaris uh you made a
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
comment earlier
 
01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
I want to ask your guidance on this
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
where relative to The Rules of Evidence
 
01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
rules of relevance
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
whereas the judges are
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
so-called the finder effect and I say
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
so-called depends on what facts are
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
being presented
 
01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:33.059 align:start position:0%
your statement that stood out to me was
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
you stated they do not have consistent
 
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
application however
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
your opinion is they're fairly applied
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
so isn't that an inherent contradiction
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
and because of that do we need to
 
01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
consider additional rules of how
 
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.990 align:start position:0%
consider additional rules of how
evidence

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
and relevance of said evidence are
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
provided so each entity
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
the defendant and plaintiff
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
are fairly
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
accessible to the Court's power
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it would be difficult
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
because of the such the factual nature
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
of of family law cases so when I say
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
that the judges are are the they're the
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
the Trier of the fact so you know in
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
jury cases the juries find determine the
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
facts but in family law cases the judges
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
are the judges and they are the
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
determiner of the facts
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and because the cases are so factual
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
it would be hard in my opinion to make a
 
01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
hard and fast rule to say that certain
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
pieces of evidence
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
need to travel a certain path before
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
they're admitted into evidence I think
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
it depends on the testimony and it
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
depends on the facts of the case so it's
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
not that the courts don't contemplate
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
how to receive evidence because they
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
have to evidence has to be authenticated
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
evidence has to be you know where does
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
this come from I just can't submit a
 
01:03:59.569 --> 01:03:59.579 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence and say oh I want you
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
to look at this judge well the judge
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
want to know what it is where did it
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
come from who generated it there's lots
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
of questions that get that get asked by
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
the judge that are consistent but
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
whether the judge accepts a piece of
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
evidence or not again in my opinion I
 
01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
think it's very relevant to what the
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
facts are of the case
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
um and what the court needs to consider
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
it's difficult
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up follow up very briefly uh
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
one question didn't want to follow real
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
quick after that do we would you
 
01:04:28.859 --> 01:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
quick after that do we would you
recommend

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
black letter law rules to be added to
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to say hopefully
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
not too inarticulately is that I think
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to make very definitive
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
rules for admitting evidence because of
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
how the facts that the judge has to hear
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
and what the judge needs to be able to
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
meet the burden under a certain law and
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
what might need to happen you know
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
whether the judge looks at a video or
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
whether the judge looks at a photograph
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
um it's just so factually related to
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
what might be in that video or on that
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
photograph and I think the Judge needs
 
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859 align:start position:0%
to consider that depending on what
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
testimony or presentation was made by
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
the litigants so it's very difficult in
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
my opinion to make something very rigid
 
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
to say this is what someone absolutely
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
needs to do to submit a piece of
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
evidence you know stipulate to that okay
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
last last question I don't ask your
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
guidance on this you referred to the
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
commission your commissioner on the
 
01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
access to Justice Commission yes and
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
what we've what I've heard from previous
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
testimony there's also a New Hampshire
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
Court Improvement project
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that of that and is
 
01:05:47.930 --> 01:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
there a consensus that could come to
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
help and uh in this these type of
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
questions that we're dealing with from
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
those organizations I'm not really
 
01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
familiar with that with that with that
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
project um representative I do know
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
there are lots of other entities there's
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
a the bar association has a committee on
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
the cooperation with the court that has
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
judges and lawyers that are also on that
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee there's lots of
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
um entities that I think help the court
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
communicate with the public and with
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
lawyers so I'm not aware of of the work
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
of that particular
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
um group okay thank you very much
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
attorney thank you Mr chairman
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
in listening to what numbers of people
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
have brought forward they focus on but
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
this is facts and I'm looking at rule
 
01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:31.940 align:start position:0%
401 the test for Relevant evidence
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
granted this is you know but still
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
evidence is relevant if it has any
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
tendency to make a fact more or less
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
probable than it would be without the
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
evidence the fact is of consequence in
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
determining actions I can see all kinds
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
of facts that might want to be brought
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
up but don't help the case so the judge
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
may not accept it because it doesn't
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
serve the purpose of the trial would I
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
be roughly on track here I think you are
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
chairman and I also think that what
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
happens is those facts there's a burden
 
01:07:08.089 --> 01:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
under the statutes whatever statute
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
you're trying to prove so for example if
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
you're trying to relocate with your
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
child to another state there you know
 
01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:15.490 align:start position:0%
child to another state there you know
RSA

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:15.500 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
461-a you know colon 11 and 12 deal with
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
those kind of relocations and so some
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
facts help you meet the burden under the
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
law and some facts don't so I I would
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
I do have one um it looks like final
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
question for you uh and that is could
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
would you review how disciplinary cases
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
of attorneys are done uh certainly I do
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
not mean specific names or specific
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
instances but should a hypothetical come
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
your way what is the process
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that question I will
 
01:07:58.849 --> 01:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
admit that I I I'm going to knock on
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
some wood that I've not had to
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
experience that process myself but New
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an attorney discipline
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
office and uh in a website and I know
 
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
that you can get the process or you can
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
go through the process if you go to that
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
website chairman and be able to see
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what needs to be done and I I'm
 
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.769 align:start position:0%
exactly what needs to be done and I I'm
not

01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:18.779 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
um without referencing materials on that
 
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:22.610 align:start position:0%
um without referencing materials on that
website

01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm not totally Familiar of the
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
deadlines that need to happen but I know
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
that members of the public can file or
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
attorneys or judges can file a complaint
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
when attorney has when an attorney has
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
violated a rule and then that process
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
starts but that website would be very
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
helpful and that website would tell us
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
what percentage of those who would
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
eventually pass judgment are themselves
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
fellow members of the bar association as
 
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
opposed to people who are independent of
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure if you can see the the
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
percentages but you can see all the
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
disciplinary decisions made on that
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
website what I'm striving for is not
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
specifically a decision against attorney
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
so and so but if there were 10 members
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
of the group that makes the
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
determination and meets out a punishment
 
01:09:11.169 --> 01:09:11.179 align:start position:0%
of some degree
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
two lawyers and eight members of the
 
01:09:15.169 --> 01:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
public versus eight lawyers and two
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
members of the public begs questions and
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's would that
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
website tell us
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure chairman but you could call
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
the attorney discipline office and I
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
point you in the right direction or
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
answer your questions about that
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Macbeth
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to follow up are you aware
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
um in malpractice our family law
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
attorneys are they likely to have an
 
01:09:49.809 --> 01:09:49.819 align:start position:0%
increased malpractice rates are they of
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
do they practice in an area that
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
frequently litigants or unhappy thank
 
01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
you for that question so I only know
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
from from my own malpractice carrier and
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
the you know legal education classes I
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
take from them that it seems like family
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
law is
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
one of the top if not the top areas of
 
01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:09.130 align:start position:0%
one of the top if not the top areas of
of

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:09.140 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
malpractice you know along with real
 
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.169 align:start position:0%
malpractice you know along with real
estate

01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
estate
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I believe those are the top two areas
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
but I'm not positive that I only know
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
01:10:29.209 --> 01:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion or in your experience
 
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering have you witnessed or
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
do you believe it's possible that there
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
could be a bias just when the parents
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
walk into the courtroom is already in a
 
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.370 align:start position:0%
walk into the courtroom is already in a
bias

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
bias
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
you know I think that there are lots of
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
studies about inherent bias um for
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
judges litigants attorneys I don't know
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
if the courts or the legal system has
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
done any work about those kind of
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
inherent biases
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
um but I don't outwardly see a bias on
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
just how people walking into the
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
courtroom are walking into the courtroom
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
but I know those certain biases do exist
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up please follow up
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
um in going with that I'm just going to
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
ask this question and I do not want to
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
diminish domestic violence or anything
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
but just because people have come to
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
testify and because of constituents who
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
have reached down to me
 
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.410 align:start position:0%
have reached down to me
um

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
in your opinion do you see a way where
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
the family court can actually be
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
you know it's a tough question because I
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
think sometimes people file
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
um cases they file motions they file
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
things because sometimes people believe
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's what they need to do I've seen it
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
work the other way I've been involved in
 
01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
a case where a self-represented parent
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
has filed over you know 200 motions and
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know requests and things like that
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
so I think it works both ways but I
 
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.050 align:start position:0%
so I think it works both ways but I
think

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
um you know perhaps that's how somebody
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
might feel but I think it's up to the
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
court to try to deal with you know
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
people filing you know duplicative
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
leadings or multiple pleadings
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
um but sure I think that sometimes the
 
01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:16.219 align:start position:0%
court has to receive in motions from
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys and litigants that they need
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with and there are lots of cases
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
where there are multiple things filed
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
and cases go on for a very long time yes
 
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up follow-ups and um do
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
you feel that if or
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
in your professional opinion if there
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
was a presumption going into court of 50
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
50 parenting do you feel that that might
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
lessen the animosity of one parent
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
against another to try and get full
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
custody or just to use as I said to
 
01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:51.620 align:start position:0%
weaponize the court to hurt the other
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
one form that I think that the committee
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
might want to take a look at is on the
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
parenting plan
 
01:12:58.970 --> 01:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
um from the Family Division the very
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
first page of the parenting plan
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
um outlines what the understanding um
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
from the legislature in the courts about
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
parenting and there's a per I won't call
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
it a presumption there's not a
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
presumption in the law in my opinion but
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
there is sort of a presumption that
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
children do best when they have frequent
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
and continuing contact with both parents
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I do believe the court tries to
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
start with that premise and then the
 
01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
facts come out about why a parent might
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
not be able to have 50 parenting time
 
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
based on what's in the best interest of
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
a child that's the perspective the court
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
always comes from again in my opinion
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
they look at I tell my own clients
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's not that the court
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't care about them but they really
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
care about kids and they want to make
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
sure that kids are safe and so when you
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
look at that parenting plan you can see
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
those the things that the court
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
considers when they're making a
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
parenting and I I think they do start
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
from a place where both parents should
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
have parenting time with the kids what
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
that parenting time should be really
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
starts to depend on the facts and then
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
how somebody meets their burden under
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
the law thank you very much I appreciate
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%

any questions my aunt was a pilot
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
project Para

a nurse practitioner 50 years ago so I
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
the concept yeah thank you great thank
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
you uh Sue New Hampshire legal
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
assistance is a Statewide non-profit Law
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
Firm our attorneys and paralegals
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
represent low-income and aging clients
 
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
in civil cases involving urgent and
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
basic needs including safety from
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and stalking
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
our domestic violence advocacy project
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
or dbap represents low-income victims
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
and survivors of domestic violence
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and stalking in their
 
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
highly valid protective order cases and
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
in their family court cases so that's
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
the divorce parenting and when I refer
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
to highly valid cases that means there's
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
a high likelihood that the victim will
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
be killed or seriously injured by their
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
intimate partner and just for some
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
context in 2022 nhla represented nearly
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
200 clients in Family Division cases
 
01:17:55.090 --> 01:17:55.100 align:start position:0%
Statewide so again we are a Statewide
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
non-profit Law Firm so that gives us a
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
unique perspective
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh so I thought it would be a good idea
 
01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.490 align:start position:0%
uh so I thought it would be a good idea
to

01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully I didn't miss the Mark
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
here to go through the start of the
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
Inception of the Family Division and
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
then to talk a little bit about the
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
goals of the Family Division when it was
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
first created back in 2004 really are
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
those goals being met in today's world
 
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
in today's Family Division World and
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
then what might we do going forward how
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
can we make things better I think that's
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the goal of this committee is it's
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
the goal of stakeholders I know the
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
public is invested so what can we do to
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
improve the services that are being
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
provided to litigants and those
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
accessing the Family Division through
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
so as you can see I put the statute in
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
uh from 2004 that created the Family
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
Division within the judicial branch and
 
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
then I broke it down really into four
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
different goals and I'll start with Goal
 
01:19:01.729 --> 01:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
one the first goal of the Family
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
Division was really to
 
01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
Division was really to
um

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
create the respectful treatment of all
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
citizens by justices marital Masters and
 
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
other family division staff and I know
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
you have all heard in this committee and
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
also in the children and family law
 
01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:19.090 align:start position:0%
also in the children and family law
committee

01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:19.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
from many public coming forward where
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
they are saying that's simply not the
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
case and I do want to respect and honor
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
their experiences
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
and those are individual experiences and
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
I definitely hear what litigants are
 
01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
saying that they may not have received
 
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
the respectful treatment that they
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
should be receiving under the statute so
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
what are the remedies to that so if
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
somebody is not getting this respectful
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
treatment by the justices what can that
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
person do they can make a complaint to
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee they can
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
complete a circuit court judicial
 
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
evaluation on the Court's website if you
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
go to the judicial court website
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
um it's not all of the justices you can
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
go to the particular Division and it
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
will list I don't know maybe four or
 
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
five judges that are up for evaluation I
 
01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
think they're on a rotating schedule and
 
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
anyone can go and complete an evaluation
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
so that is certainly an option for
 
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
people complete an evaluation if that
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
judge is listed what if that judge was
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
evaluated last year and you're now
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
having a bad experience how long do you
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
have to wait before that person is going
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
to rotate up again I don't know exactly
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
what the rotation is Mr chairman but in
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
that case I would certainly reach out to
 
01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee so there
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
are multiple options so not only
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation but the judicial conduct
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
Committee of course there's the
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
Appellate process if you're having a
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh goal number two is the prompt and
 
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
fair resolution of family issues and uh
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
the second part of that goal is that
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
there are specially selected and trained
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh justices and marital Masters so is
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
this happening and if not why not so
 
01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you heard attorney Chandelier's talk
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
about the judge shortage that is
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
certainly true we've talked about the
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
backed up dockets and I wanted to give
 
01:21:26.689 --> 01:21:26.699 align:start position:0%
some context about the backed up dockets
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
there are cases that require certain
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
statutory guidelines where cases have to
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
be heard within a period of time so
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases stalking cases
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to be heard within 30 days the
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
defendant is able to expedite those
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
cases the case has to be heard within
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
five days if somebody files an ex parte
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
motion within their parenting or divorce
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
case those cases have to be heard within
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
30 days so there are emergency type
 
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.490 align:start position:0%
30 days so there are emergency type
cases

01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
that are happening that need to that
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
need to be heard within that time frame
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it bumps the regularly scheduled
 
01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:04.460 align:start position:0%
cases let's say
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that issue covid
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
was a huge issue the courts essentially
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
with the exception of non-emer uh
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
non-emer with the exception of emergency
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
type cases the courts essentially had to
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
shut down when covet happened much like
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so you had all of those cases that
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
were pending pre-covered all those cases
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
that had hearing scheduled trials
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled and those had to be put on
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
hold unless it was an emergency so then
 
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
when but life doesn't stop life didn't
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
stop with covid and people were still
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
having issues people still wanted to get
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
divorced people still wanted to be
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
separated from their partner and needed
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
parenting plans
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
so filings were still happening they
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
just weren't necessarily getting
 
01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
scheduled for hearings
 
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
so you had all of the cases pre-covered
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
that needed to be rescheduled and then
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
you had all the cases that were being
 
01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:04.739 align:start position:0%
filed or people wanted to file during
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
covid so it just really overloaded the
 
01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
docket and they're working really hard
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
to try to figure that out and prioritize
 
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
but yes it's not always leading to The
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
Prompt resolution of these matters
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about not there not
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
being enough judges
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of the training uh
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
the judges need training absolutely
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
training is important in all professions
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
training is important and it's important
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be updated on
 
01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
um you know what are the current best
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
policies and practices but the problem
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
when you take the judges Off the Bench
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
to do the training it creates more
 
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
delays because they're not hearing cases
 
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly something to
 
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
consider that's what the Chief Justice
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
told me when I gave him several things A
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
continuing education could be added to
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the justices in the state absolutely
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
and he said thank you for the seven
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
judges you're getting us in the budget I
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
said we'll see but we need we'll
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
probably need even more if we have more
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
continuing ed yes yeah
 
01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:10.850 align:start position:0%
continuing ed yes yeah
yeah

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
um so then you know it talks about the
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
Statue talks about specially selected
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
and trained so what does that mean so
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
the circuit court is made up of three
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
divisions it's made up of the Family
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
Division it's made up of the probate
 
01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
Division and it's made up of the
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
district Division and this was really it
 
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
was created with thought and it was
 
01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
meant to create an ease within the
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
circuit court so that a judge in
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
District Court could hear a Family
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
Division case or a probate judge could
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
hear district court case
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
um so that they could seamlessly move
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
between these different case types but
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
then you have to think does that make
 
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.850 align:start position:0%
then you have to think does that make
sense

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.390 align:start position:0%
sense
um

01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:53.209 --> 01:24:53.219 align:start position:0%
does it make sense for a judge who you
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
know primarily listens to misdemeanor
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
drug charge
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
cases on a daily basis to then try to
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
figure out the complex nature of the
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
best interest standard in a family court
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
case does that make sense it may have
 
01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
made sense back in 2004 but does it make
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
sense today or does it make more sense
 
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
you know to continue this circuit court
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
but have Specialties within the Circuit
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
Court like what it was intended to be
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
probably which is a judge would hear a
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
specific case type it would be very
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and have expertise in that
 
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.810 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and have expertise in that
particular

01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.610 align:start position:0%
particular
area

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
so then goal number three was the use of
 
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution to reduce
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
the adversarial nature of proceedings
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
involving families
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
um so I broke this down into the pros
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
and cons
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
um and and is this happening
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
I would say alternative dispute
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
resolution is happening and when I say
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution I'm
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
referring to what we commonly talk about
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
is mediation is mediation happening yes
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
in my opinion is it heavy-handed yes why
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
is it heavy-handed because it's an easy
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
way for the docket to be cleared up
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's if cases can be resolved through
 
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.790 align:start position:0%
it's if cases can be resolved through
mediation

01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's great you have a certified family
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
mediator or maybe you're using a private
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
mediator and you can meet and amicably
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
and safely meet both parties to come
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
together and come to a good resolution
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
of the case and what does that mean that
 
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
means that that's one less case on the
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
court stock it one less case taking up
 
01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
time so yes there is in my opinion
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
a real push for
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
um for cases to go through mediation
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'm coming at it from a domestic
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
violence perspective and mediation in
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases is not generally
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
safe there's the actual physical safety
 
01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
involved with media mediating cases but
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
then there's that underlying coercive
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
control if you have one party who is an
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
abuser can are they really needing in
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
good faith to resolve the case or are
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
they really meeting because it's a
 
01:27:11.689 --> 01:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
further way to abuse their partner
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
through the court system
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so that's a consideration our case is
 
01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:19.340 align:start position:0%
inappropriately going to mediation
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
should cases be going to mediation and
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
if so which ones you know because
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
mediation has a lot of benefits in
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
addition to you know freeing up the
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
docket a little bit
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
but it really also embodies the mission
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
of the family court system which is to
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
reduce conflict between the parties and
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
reduce the tension and to honor and
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that this is a difficult
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
time for parties going through this I'm
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
sure when parties got together they
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
weren't initially thinking I'm going to
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
get divorced or we're going to have kids
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
together and then we're going to have to
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
figure out who has parenting time and
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
when and how are exchange is going to
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
happen so just honoring the experience
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
that litigants are going through so if
 
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
parties are able to safely and amicably
 
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
reach resolution through mediation
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
that's great but that's not all cases
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly not most domestic
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
violence cases
 
01:28:14.159 --> 01:28:14.810 align:start position:0%
violence cases
um

01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
and then particularly in domestic
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
violence cases if you have cases that
 
01:28:21.290 --> 01:28:21.300 align:start position:0%
are resolved through mediation but there
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
was that coercive control component
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
involved then that means that agreement
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
that final agreement isn't going to hold
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
up it might hold up for 30 days it might
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
hold up for six months but inevitably if
 
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.110 align:start position:0%
hold up for six months but inevitably if
the

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.010 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
if the parent who was abused
 
01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:42.110 align:start position:0%
if the parent who was abused
um

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
you know didn't made that agreement
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
because they felt that they didn't have
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
another option then down the line it's
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to fall apart it's not going to
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
work it's going to be the holidays it's
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to be what was agreed to in terms
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the parenting schedule
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
um so what does that mean that means
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
then the case is going to be litigated
 
01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
but it's going to go back as a
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
modification case and that will that
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then goal number four
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
the assignment of all family matters of
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
a single family to one Family Division
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
Justice or marital master
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
so I already spoke to this a little bit
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
but is this happening no it's not really
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
happening and this isn't me faulting the
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
court in any way this is recognizing
 
01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
that there are issues that don't allow
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
for this to happen one is that contested
 
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
cases go on for years at times yeah you
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
know we used to in our experience
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
contested divorce parenting cases could
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
take one or two years to resolve that's
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
what we would tell our clients but since
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
covid we're looking at potentially three
 
01:29:54.169 --> 01:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
four years to resolve
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and in that three to four years are
 
01:29:58.610 --> 01:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
you going to have the same judge hearing
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
the case probably not
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
um you might for a little while but then
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
judges are frequently rotated
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
um among the family courts among the
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
family divisions so you might have a
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
different judge
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
um in year two and then you're finding
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
yourselves retelling
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
the facts of the case
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
um you know the judge has the file and
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
we'll read the file but they haven't
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
been invested in the case for the last
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
year so now you have to take the time
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
to really relitigate what you've gone
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
through for the past year because you
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
really want the judge to understand
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
what's been happening
 
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.450 align:start position:0%
what's been happening
um

01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:38.090 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
this is this is hard it was in the
 
01:30:43.850 --> 01:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
statute it's not happening and there are
 
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons why it's not happening
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
but I think as you consider what
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations you might make I think
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
it is consistency is key
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I have spoken about consistency in
 
01:31:01.310 --> 01:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
the family court system uh
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
in in different forums but consistency
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
is key across the state it helps
 
01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
litigants understand and have an idea of
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
what to expect if you have the same
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
judge hearing your case if you have the
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
same judge that's hearing the domestic
 
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
violence case but then also here's the
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
parenting case they already know the
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
parties they know what's happening they
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
know the kiddos they understand the
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of this particular case but
 
01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:29.219 align:start position:0%
let's say that judge gets moved they
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
were in Manchester and then they get
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
moved to Claremont and then you have a
 
01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:35.219 align:start position:0%
judge that's coming from Portsmouth it's
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
a it sets up a whole different Dynamic
 
01:31:40.010 --> 01:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
and what if that judge doesn't
 
01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:40.729 align:start position:0%
and what if that judge doesn't
um

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
used as a different
 
01:31:46.570 --> 01:31:46.580 align:start position:0%
process in terms of how they want
 
01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
evidence submitted or how they want the
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
form submitted so consistency is key it
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
helps practitioners helps lawyers figure
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
out what is wanted when they're trying a
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
case but it also helps litigants to
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
understand what's expected of me so I
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
would really urge you to look at this
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
goal and say is that something that's
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
feasible is it possible to have
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
um you know more consistency in in
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
judges sitting on particular cases
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
so then I want to talk a little bit
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
about the barriers reaching some of
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
these goals and I know I've touched on
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
some of them already but I I think
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
generally there's a lack of
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of the family court system
 
01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.450 align:start position:0%
understanding of the family court system
um

01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's not anyone's fault a lot of times
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
people don't have
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and they don't know what to expect
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
because they've never gone through the
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
process if you haven't filed for divorce
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
or you haven't filed a domestic violence
 
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
petition you don't know what you're
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to get when you walk through the
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
door particularly if you're
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
self-represented and I think a lot of
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
people their experience is based on what
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
they see on TV and it's not that
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
experience would you say that the TV
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
show Nightcore is not representative of
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
Night Court in this state you know great
 
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
show great show but yes you admitted to
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
watch it thank you gotcha are we talking
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
the spin-off are we talking the original
 
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
yes we are the original
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay yes excellent show but not the same
 
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
not at all there's no jury
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
um you know it's just a very different
 
01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
process uh so I think lack of
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of the family court system
 
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
is one barrier disparity in income and
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
resources between the parties
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
um one party might have the resources to
 
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:36.260 align:start position:0%
hire an attorney the other party may not
 
01:33:39.709 --> 01:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
and we represent clients free of charge
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
but we are us we don't have the
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
resources to serve everyone that comes
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
through our door I wish that we did but
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
we are turning many many people away
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes the cases that we are
 
01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes the cases that we are
getting

01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
are the cases are either so complex that
 
01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
they're not appropriate maybe for a
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
volunteer attorney so if we're not
 
01:34:01.129 --> 01:34:01.139 align:start position:0%
taking the case then no one is taking
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
the case and the person is going uh to
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
court unrepresented and self-represented
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
the party's ability to hire a gal
 
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's no longer a court fund that pays
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
for Guardians ad litem so what does that
 
01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
mean Jal still participate in cases
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
there's still
 
01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
um ordered to uh for a gal to be
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
appointed in a case but those are only
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
cases where one of the parties or both
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
of the parties have the resources to pay
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
for a gal so what kind what does that
 
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
set up in terms of a system
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
um particularly in domestic violence
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
case again you've got the power and
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
control Dynamic what happens if Dad has
 
01:34:47.649 --> 01:34:47.659 align:start position:0%
all of the money and Mom has stayed home
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
and dad has been abusive dad can hire
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
the gal and Dad recommends the gal and
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's the gal that gets appointed to
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
the case well how does that from the
 
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
perspective of mom
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and the vulnerable parent is Mom
 
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to feel comfortable in that case
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
talking to the gal knowing that her
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
abusive spouse is paying for the gal it
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
just sets up a bad system or lack of
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
Affair system
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
um that then there is an intersect
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
between uh dcyf and the court system
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh let's say
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
um there's a report made to dcyf that
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
abuse is occurring in the home either to
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
one of the parents or to the kiddos or
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
to both a report is made and dcyf
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
um advises the parents the vulnerable
 
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
parent to go file parenting petition or
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
go get a domestic violence order
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
um that may be at some point the right
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
answer but in that moment it may not be
 
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
the safest answer for that person so
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
let's say the parent does that follows
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
the advice of dcyf and they do that but
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
then the court says well what's dcyf
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
doing is dcyf involved well no dcyf is
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
closed the case because Mom is or the
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
vulnerable parent is going to take steps
 
01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:15.659 align:start position:0%
to protect the child so dcyf says okay
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
closing the case mom has made an effort
 
01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
to protect the child family court will
 
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:24.179 align:start position:0%
take it from here well Family Court
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
looks at it and says dcyf isn't involved
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
so dcyf isn't involved so is there an
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
issue here dcyf closed the case saying
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's unfounded so it's this cycle of
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know there is a concern but both
 
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
sides are really
 
01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:43.129 align:start position:0%
sides are really
um

01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
they're hoping for input from the other
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
side and it's just not happening yes
 
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:50.580 align:start position:0%
yes chair recognizes the vice chair with
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
a question I don't want to betraying it
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
to me to end up with
 
01:37:06.189 --> 01:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
dcyf having justification to say
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
unfounded what dcyf
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
could say is
 
01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:13.729 align:start position:0%
could say is
um

01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
founded with one of the
 
01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:22.139 align:start position:0%
principles taking action
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
how can they justify saying unfounded
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't work for dcyf and I'm only
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
speaking on what I have seen in the
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
cases that we have handled uh and what
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
people have reported to me and and I
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
know a lot goes into
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
what Rises to the level of a finding
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
um but it
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
it has seemed that what does happen is
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
that perhaps it could rise to a level of
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
of a finding but what they have seen is
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
that Mom or the victim parent vulnerable
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
parent is taking steps to protect the
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
child and that satisfies some of the
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
requirements and so they they
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases I'm sure they do make a
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
finding but oftentimes it's unfounded
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
and then they're left to go to the
 
01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
family court without a finding from dcyf
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
based on the abuse that they've alleged
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
Mr I wonder if I could ask you to
 
01:38:28.729 --> 01:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
consider raising this question with the
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative from dcyf
 
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:33.070 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative from dcyf
about

01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
exactly how they handle the situation
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
when they see that there is a problem
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
and also see that
 
01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.189 align:start position:0%
and also see that
um

01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
steps are being taken by one of the
 
01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.010 align:start position:0%
steps are being taken by one of the
principals

01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
because on on the trust but verify
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
approach that um
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
many of us feel comfortable with I
 
01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
completely accept everything you say
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
and yet I cannot
 
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:07.610 align:start position:0%
and yet I cannot
imagine

01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
I cannot be comfortable with that in
 
01:39:10.739 --> 01:39:12.110 align:start position:0%
I cannot be comfortable with that in
fact

01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
representing the East with which dcif
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
could pass off the case
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
again I'm not suggesting that there is
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily an ease and there is a
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
thought process but a lot of it is on
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
the onus of the parent to protect the
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
child and to take the steps maybe I can
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
suggest that all my friends
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
from your group and dcuif in the courts
 
01:39:43.370 --> 01:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful time
 
01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:45.380 align:start position:0%
in mediation
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
finding this beautiful wonderful
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
protocol protocol that works so
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
wonderfully for the children and
 
01:39:56.209 --> 01:39:56.219 align:start position:0%
everybody else involved because you're I
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
think pretty much good people trying to
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
do good things and sometimes the system
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at and said how come
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
good people trying to do good things
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
isn't always working and I'm wondering
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
if that conversation could be had yes
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
and and I also want to assure everyone
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
I want you all to have a
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
clear picture from our perspective of
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
what our experience has been I don't
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
think you're able to make the
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
recommendations that you need to make if
 
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
we're not all very upfront with what is
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
happening within the system and how we
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
can fix it and they're just lying hey
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
excuse hey quiet audience will be quiet
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
or we'll leave
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
s covering those difficult conversations
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
so this working together is an ongoing
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
process so we're going to hear very very
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
few cases going forward because of
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
whoops how did we
 
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
come up with something that just isn't
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
working it's not a perfect system no
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's not but it can be better 100 could
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
be better on all forums you know this
 
01:41:16.729 --> 01:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
isn't just the court or dcyf or you know
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
one particular agency or group this is
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
we all need to work collectively and if
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
I'm able to get through the rest of my
 
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
presentation I will absolutely let you
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
know the good work that all of these
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
groups are you will and could we have a
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
report back in September as to how you
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to go into details unless
 
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:36.380 align:start position:0%
we have to make some recommendations or
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
legislation out of it but just a little
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
note signed by everybody that hey we met
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
over hot dogs over the summer and we had
 
01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
a wonderful time and tossed the Frisbee
 
01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
and ate corn on the cob and worked out
 
01:41:49.070 --> 01:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
some of these things just keep us in the
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
loop would you you may continue thank
 
01:41:51.060 --> 01:42:01.629 align:start position:0%
loop would you you may continue thank
you

01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
experiences you've heard a lot of them
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
are these systemic issues that we're
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
talking about on a Statewide level are
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
these individual cases individual issues
 
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:15.020 align:start position:0%
and are we talking about really read
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
dismantling or restructuring an entire
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
system based on any particular
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
individual I think there's a lack of
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of domestic violence and
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
the effects of trauma and how victims
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
present when they have either been
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
abused domestically domestic abuse by
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
their partner or sexual abuse or
 
01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.169 align:start position:0%
their partner or sexual abuse or
stalking

01:42:38.169 --> 01:42:38.179 align:start position:0%
stalking
 
01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:40.820 align:start position:0%
gender-based biases within the system
 
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
inappropriate access to language access
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
services and lack of necessary resources
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
you know we're tying our judges hands
 
01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
that we have situations where kiddos the
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
safest option for them if a parent is to
 
01:42:59.090 --> 01:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
have is to have parenting time with that
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
kiddo is supervised visitation
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're tying our judges hands because we
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
have one safe supervised visitation
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
center left in this state and their
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
funding I believe ends in December of
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
this year one safe supervised visitation
 
01:43:17.209 --> 01:43:17.219 align:start position:0%
center left that uses a metal detector
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
that follows best practices
 
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
so and and that Center is in Stratford
 
01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.290 align:start position:0%
so and and that Center is in Stratford
County

01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
but they accept uh cases from all over
 
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
the state not just Stratford County but
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
who who from the North country is going
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
to drive to Stratford County to be able
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
to use supervised visitation and so what
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
does that mean for our judges you know
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
they they very much want to I mean you
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
can read in the statute
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
um what the goal of RSA 461a is to
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
support frequent and continuing contact
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
when it's safe to do so and sometimes
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's within the supervised visitation
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
center but what if we don't have
 
01:43:56.410 --> 01:43:56.420 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation centers anymore
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
what is the judge going to do the judge
 
01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
is going to balance no parenting time
 
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
for this person or unsupervised
 
01:44:07.129 --> 01:44:07.139 align:start position:0%
parenting time for this person and those
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
neither of those are good options so we
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
really do need to think about what
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
resources are available
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
batterers Intervention Program batteries
 
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
so then I want to talk a little bit
 
01:44:27.169 --> 01:44:27.179 align:start position:0%
about the myths that
 
01:44:27.179 --> 01:44:28.010 align:start position:0%
about the myths that
um

01:44:28.010 --> 01:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
come up frequently in
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
um children family law committee I
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
believe they've been raised in this
 
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
um you know we talk about a lot with 50
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
50 shared parenting
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
um and that parental rights and
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the default
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
automatically goes to Mom
 
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's not true
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
um in fact mothers are more likely to
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
lose custody of their children when
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse are made against
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
the father could we have some
 
01:44:58.139 --> 01:44:59.530 align:start position:0%
the father could we have some
documentation

01:44:59.530 --> 01:44:59.540 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:02.580 align:start position:0%
study for you you are very quick we have
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
this study thank you so I I do want to
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that moms in family court it's not
 
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
automatic it's not the default and
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when they do raise
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse whether it's
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
physical abuse or sexual abuse that they
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
are more likely to lose custody of their
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
kids even if there have been findings of
 
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
abuse even if it has been proven that
 
01:45:27.290 --> 01:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
there are allegations
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
um are true against the father
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
committing committing abuse that they
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
are still likely to lose custody
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh and then gender bias against women
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
does exist within the system you have
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that um
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
victims are often experiencing uh
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
effects of the trauma and that spills
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
over into the family court case
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
um they are in court at a table next to
 
01:46:06.250 --> 01:46:06.260 align:start position:0%
their abuser uh they are
 
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
re-triggered they're triggered uh they
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
are often emotional uh they are unable
 
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
to present their case particularly if
 
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're self-represented
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
um because that's what trauma does and
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
and I when I talk about biases I think
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
um the opposite is true if somebody is
 
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
alleging abuse and
 
01:46:31.490 --> 01:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
um judge sees that person and they have
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
an idea in their head of how is a victim
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
supposed to behave how is a victim
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
supposed to testify oh they're supposed
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
to be crying oh they're supposed to be
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
hysterical well this person isn't doing
 
01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
any of those things so did it happen
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
those kinds of biases we are constantly
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
training the judges on that we have to
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
let go of these biases but for the
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
parent or the mom that is presenting in
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
a particular way that is presenting as a
 
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
typical Vic dumb uh that they are
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
hysterical and emotional and unable to
 
01:47:07.729 --> 01:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
present their case and that hurts them
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
they because the abuser oftentimes is
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
put together is able to articulate uh
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the continued abuse
 
01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:19.250 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the continued abuse
and

01:47:19.250 --> 01:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:20.149 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
it does not bode well all the time for
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
moms in those cases and that's where the
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
statistic comes in because they can't
 
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
they can't present well
 
01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask representative ball for
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
her question because I think we're
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
trying to as presented thank you
 
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
trying to as presented thank you
thank you chairman

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:39.850 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:39.850 --> 01:47:45.169 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't all of this still be true
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
for the father who's being accused
 
01:47:50.219 --> 01:47:50.870 align:start position:0%
for the father who's being accused
um

01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
unjustly that he might also present as a
 
01:47:56.590 --> 01:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
little bit upset and maybe even
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive in the courtroom because he's
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
afraid of losing his children
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
if the father has been accused all right
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I'm saying
 
01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
even if the father has not been accused
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
even if he believes it's a false
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
allegation for it's going two ways I'm
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
saying it's a very emotional time in the
 
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:16.860 align:start position:0%
courtroom and shouldn't both parents be
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
given some degree of latitude of
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
um this is emotional the children are
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
involved maybe one or both didn't ever
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
even expect to be in the courtroom for a
 
01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.830 align:start position:0%
even expect to be in the courtroom for a
divorce

01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm kind of a little concerned
 
01:48:33.239 --> 01:48:34.790 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm kind of a little concerned
when

01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
um we keep referring to females as the
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
only victims in the courtroom
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion and I don't want
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be little domestic violence but I've
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
also heard and I just correct me if I'm
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
wrong but wouldn't also emotional abuse
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
and verbal abuse be considered not just
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
sexual and not just physical abuse isn't
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
that all abuse
 
01:48:56.810 --> 01:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and for
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
making that distinction I would 100
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
agree with you that emotional abuse
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse Financial abuse all
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
of that is abuse unfortunately that is
 
01:49:09.050 --> 01:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
not the definition of abuse under New
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law so it does not
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
include those factors do you have the
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
RSA on abuse statute I I don't have it
 
01:49:19.209 --> 01:49:19.219 align:start position:0%
with me but I can tell you that it's
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
sexual assault physical assault
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
harassment interference with freedom
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
which would be stalking destruction of
 
01:49:34.250 --> 01:49:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh and criminal threatening
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
clarification I very much appreciate it
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
so yes I do want to acknowledge
 
01:49:50.689 --> 01:49:50.699 align:start position:0%
um also to your point representative
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
ball that
 
01:49:55.370 --> 01:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
um there are K I'm here because I work
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
exclusively with domestic violence
 
01:49:59.930 --> 01:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
victims primarily who are women
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
um statistically uh women are making
 
01:50:04.850 --> 01:50:04.860 align:start position:0%
more reports of domestic violence and
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
statistically you know I think it's one
 
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
in I I don't actually want to quote the
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
exact number I can certainly get that
 
01:50:13.729 --> 01:50:13.739 align:start position:0%
for you that is not to say that there
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
are not male victims of domestic
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
violence and we do represent male
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence but for the
 
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
cases where we are providing
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
representation our clients are primarily
 
01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
representation our clients are primarily
female

01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
female
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
um but there are cases that do not
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
involve domestic violence at all uh in
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
Family Court uh and certainly even in
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
those cases where there is no domestic
 
01:50:37.609 --> 01:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
violence yes emotions are going to run
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
very high and
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know it is and um it is a
 
01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
difficult process and yes everybody
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
should be given in some Grace in the
 
01:50:51.410 --> 01:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
family court system because and there is
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
a recognition of that in the statute I
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
think that there should be recognition
 
01:50:59.090 --> 01:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
that this is a difficult and a difficult
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
process and the goal is to make it so
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's not adversarial unfortunately that
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.739 --> 01:51:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:10.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:12.590 --> 01:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
and again I'm talking about protective
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
mothers and the experience because again
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's what you'll see in the report
 
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
that I provided but also
 
01:51:21.729 --> 01:51:21.739 align:start position:0%
um this is our primary client population
 
01:51:24.410 --> 01:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
that protective moms are often seen as
 
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
hyper Vigilant and overly protective
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
um strides that they take to protect
 
01:51:32.090 --> 01:51:32.100 align:start position:0%
their children when a system fails them
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
raises allegations of Parental
 
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
alienation syndrome which is not in fact
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
A syndrome it is oftentimes used as a
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
tactic by abusive fathers to further
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
abuse within the family court system
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
because they're no longer able to do
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.750 align:start position:0%
yes representative McMahon thank you Mr
chairman

01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
specific to that subject you just
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
brought up and what we had testimony
 
01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:01.490 align:start position:0%
brought up and what we had testimony
from

01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney chandeliers
 
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
judged system would decide The Rules of
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
Evidence or relevance and as stated that
 
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
parental alienation syndrome is not a
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
recognized syndrome and I'm just a defer
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
a moment is that by what higher
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
authority would it be a recognized
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
syndrome if it was in the DSM which is
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
lists all of the different syndromes and
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
mental health as of which Edition did it
 
01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
come in
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
it's not in there it's not it's not okay
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay then then the follow-up one uh
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman then on
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
that subject matter
 
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:39.020 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
environment of the court system would
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
not the J with
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
other judges not
 
01:52:49.129 --> 01:52:49.139 align:start position:0%
eliminating that uh under relevance and
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
evidence because it's not a recognized
 
01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.970 align:start position:0%
evidence because it's not a recognized
syndrome

01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question uh it is
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
my experience that that
 
01:53:01.370 --> 01:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
has been raised in family court and
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody calls it
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
parental alienation syndrome or calls it
 
01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:08.820 align:start position:0%
parental alienation that those facts are
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
in fact considered in some decisions
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
then one final clarification then
 
01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%
because yes this is thank you Mr
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
chairman this is going on to the when we
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a discussion as a committee on what
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
rules to recommend
 
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
is this then an opinion on a statement
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
made in this case by one party not
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying male or female but
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
just one party
 
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
that then it is
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
The Scholar letter of Pas is put on the
 
01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that statement versus
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
what the facts are
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
um I think that can absolutely play out
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
that way I think that one parent for
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
example could be make could be talking
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the pediatrician could be talking to
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
dcyf they're doing that because they're
 
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
scared that something is going on with
 
01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
the child because the child has either
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
told them or the child is exhibiting
 
01:54:09.290 --> 01:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
symptoms of abuse or neglect and so
 
01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
they're taking these steps to protect
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
the child but to
 
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
the other side the person who is being
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
accused of doing those things to the
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
child can raise these well she just
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't want I will the other parent who
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
is doing these things is saying these
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
things because they don't want me to
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
have time with the kid I'm a great
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
parent but they don't want me to have
 
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
time with the kids because they're upset
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
with me about X Y and Z and so the court
 
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
considers those things
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and considers oh maybe this parent is
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
doing those things because
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
they don't want the other parent to have
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
any time with the kids and how would the
 
01:54:57.169 --> 01:54:57.179 align:start position:0%
court determine that in a criminal court
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
you've got all your investigators and
 
01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
everything what do you have in Family
 
01:55:01.619 --> 01:55:02.629 align:start position:0%
everything what do you have in Family
Court

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
Court
 
01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question thank you
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
for that uh chairman Pearson oftentimes
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
in Family Court the only evidence that
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
you have is the party's testimony and
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
that is evidence I think oftentimes
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
we're very much looking for where's the
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
document where's the police report
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
where's the medical record which is a
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
whole other issue but where are those
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
things and oftentimes there are not
 
01:55:29.450 --> 01:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
there those things aren't there you just
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
have the testimony of uh the parties
 
01:55:35.689 --> 01:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
maybe some witnesses and that's it and
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
the judge needs to make a determination
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
based on who they found was more
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
credible and again that goes into my
 
01:55:45.050 --> 01:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
discussion on presentation from either
 
01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:46.370 align:start position:0%
discussion on presentation from either
parent

01:55:46.370 --> 01:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
this can get a little dicey I think you
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
are correct
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
and we need to improve this so we need
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
to think about how to do this
 
01:55:59.330 --> 01:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
not right now but we do
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh representative Macbeth making
 
01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
a great effort in spite of
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so I just wanted to
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
um there are statutes
 
01:56:16.250 --> 01:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and 461 a
 
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
six that was mentioned by attorney
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
shenzelis earlier today it's
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
specifically has like 11
 
01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
um criteria that the courts to look at
 
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has come up with
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
and at least two of them if not three
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
have to do with which parent will
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
promote the relationship with the other
 
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
parent despite harm to them so this
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
stuff about um alienation or parents
 
01:56:41.450 --> 01:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
that are making allegations it is
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
addressed in the statute not only in
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
those three separate sections
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
um in the under the parental
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility but I can't speak to that
 
01:56:52.189 --> 01:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
right now but I will provide that to the
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee I think that's what you're
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
looking for is what standard like of
 
01:56:57.290 --> 01:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
so the testimony on Parental alienation
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
while she's correct is not a syndrome
 
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
listed in the DSM number four or any but
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
it is the step the legislature has
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
provided stats you know um criteria for
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
the court to look at in that area
 
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.290 align:start position:0%
the court to look at in that area
um

01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.350 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
so I know I've I've put a lot out there
 
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
and given you
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
um a lot of information
 
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so you know we talked about in 2004
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
what did what was the intent of the
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
legislature what was what was in the
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
Statue what were the goals of the Family
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
Division at that time
 
01:57:40.609 --> 01:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
kind of what is happening currently from
 
01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
our experience in our Statewide practice
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
but I know you want some ideas about
 
01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
what do we do from here so I was hoping
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
to and I want to keep it positive and I
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
want to tell you about all the good work
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
that is happening because there is a lot
 
01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
of good work that is happening because
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
people are recognizing that these things
 
01:57:59.930 --> 01:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
are happening within the family court
 
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
system and what can we do to correct it
 
01:58:04.850 --> 01:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
obvious answers are more funding and
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
more people to do the work
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
um you know this is the system that we
 
01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:12.659 align:start position:0%
have and you know we're not looking to
 
01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
dismantle an entire system or start from
 
01:58:15.239 --> 01:58:16.910 align:start position:0%
dismantle an entire system or start from
scratch

01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
scratch
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so what what can we do with this
 
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
system how can we enact change within
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
the current system that we have so there
 
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
are access to Legal remedies
 
01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.290 align:start position:0%
are access to Legal remedies
um

01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
people who go through the court process
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
and are not happy with the orders there
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
are multiple stages along the way where
 
01:58:35.050 --> 01:58:35.060 align:start position:0%
somebody can
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
try and get a change to their order so
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody gets an order either
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
a temporary order or in their divorce
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
case or a final order in their parenting
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
case and they don't agree with it they
 
01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
think the judge just completely got it
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
wrong either they made an error based on
 
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
the law or they didn't understand
 
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
particular facts they can file a motion
 
01:58:56.570 --> 01:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration they have 10 days to
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
file a motion for reconsideration
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
from there if it's a final order they
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
can file a New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
appeal they can access the judicial
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
conduct committee and evaluations that
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
are online I think
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
rightfully so that there were some
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
recent issues within the family court
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
system and I know you have heard from
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
the public on these issues and those
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
issues were corrected those judges are
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
not sitting on the bench anymore so
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
there was a response it may not have
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
fixed the entire problem but it wasn't
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
ignored there was a response and respect
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the work that's being done
 
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:36.589 align:start position:0%
the work that's being done
um

01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
I think everybody is genuinely well
 
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
intended and we are not uh perfect
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
people all the time it's an imperfect
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
system and we're humans and we make
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
mistakes but we are
 
01:59:51.129 --> 01:59:51.139 align:start position:0%
um working hard to address those things
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh in 2021 at the end of 2021 I'm sure
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with the situation
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
where a woman was denied a final
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
protective order out of Hampton Family
 
02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
Division and
 
02:00:06.129 --> 02:00:06.139 align:start position:0%
um several weeks later her ex-partner
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
shot her in as she was leaving her work
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
in Salem Massachusetts and that was a
 
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
tragedy and it's unfortunate that a
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
tragedy really
 
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
pushed us to enact all of this change
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
but as a result of that there was an
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
internal review within the Family
 
02:00:25.810 --> 02:00:25.820 align:start position:0%
Division there was the New Hampshire
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court set up a task force on
 
02:00:30.169 --> 02:00:30.179 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases in the New
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire judicial system I sat in on
 
02:00:35.209 --> 02:00:35.219 align:start position:0%
that task force as a result of that task
 
02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
force we produced I think it was a
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
61-page report with multiple
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
recommendations I am happy to say that
 
02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
that is not a report that is sitting on
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
a shelf that we are enacting those we
 
02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
are making those changes we are looking
 
02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
at those recommendations the governor
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
reinstated as a result of the task force
 
02:00:55.250 --> 02:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on domestic
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
violence they are working diligently to
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
make changes
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
there was a call for increased resources
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
for civil legal aid we started a
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester Domestic Violence Clinic as a
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
response we are on site every Thursday
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
at the Manchester Family Division
 
02:01:14.930 --> 02:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
on-site representing victims in their
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases as they come to
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
court so that is on demand on-site
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
Services every Thursday and we started
 
02:01:26.689 --> 02:01:26.699 align:start position:0%
that back in October as um
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
as a result of the task force report
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
I think we need data there needs to be a
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
better way to track case outcomes so we
 
02:01:37.970 --> 02:01:37.980 align:start position:0%
can see are these one-off cases are
 
02:01:41.689 --> 02:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
these is this a systemic issue or is
 
02:01:44.510 --> 02:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
this one particular case one particular
 
02:01:46.570 --> 02:01:46.580 align:start position:0%
catchment area
 
02:01:50.689 --> 02:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
we need to look at perhaps exploring the
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of civil domestic
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
violence courts within the Family
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
Division and I have a handout for you
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
about what civil domestic violence
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
courts look like so that you know and
 
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
this this is in line with one judge
 
02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:06.649 align:start position:0%
this this is in line with one judge
hearing

02:02:06.649 --> 02:02:06.659 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
the same similar types of cases so the
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
same judge here's the domestic violence
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
case the same judge here's the parenting
 
02:02:15.530 --> 02:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
case we need to have additional judge
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
training on domestic violence and the
 
02:02:22.129 --> 02:02:22.139 align:start position:0%
aces which is adverse childhood effects
 
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and more consistency across the state
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
and how courts and judges are applying
 
02:02:29.689 --> 02:02:29.699 align:start position:0%
court rules and protocols and
 
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
um one of those programs which is
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
produced by the batter of women's
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
Justice project is called the safer
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
program and it's it enables
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
professionals and judges and courts to
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
look at these cases in a similar way and
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
to ask similar questions so that there
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
is consistency across the state so a
 
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
case that's being heard in Keene is
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
being handled in a similar similar way
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
to a case that's being heard in ossipy
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
and I apologize I only have one copy of
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
that for the chair I wasn't able to make
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
multiple color copies and it requires
 
02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:07.010 align:start position:0%
multiple color copies and it requires
color

02:03:07.010 --> 02:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
color
 
02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.330 align:start position:0%
color
um

02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
do we have a color printer on the fourth
 
02:03:10.739 --> 02:03:15.709 align:start position:0%
do we have a color printer on the fourth
floor

02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
it is so huge but it's still black and
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
white okay
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry we're just you know
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine and I do just want to
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
address one additional and then I'm
 
02:03:32.330 --> 02:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
um a question that came up with attorney
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
Shannon Alaris is that can I think it
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
was I don't know if it was specific to
 
02:03:41.089 --> 02:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
the family court system or just 50 50
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
shared parental responsibilities could
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
that be used to weaponize
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the system and it is my opinion based
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
on uh the work that we do with domestic
 
02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
violence victims that yes uh the process
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
can be weaponized the family court
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
system can be weaponized shared parental
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility or 50 50 can be
 
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
weaponized because oftentimes in
 
02:04:06.370 --> 02:04:06.380 align:start position:0%
domestic violence relationships
 
02:04:10.010 --> 02:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
one the most dangerous time to leave is
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
the most dangerous time for a victim is
 
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
when they are making efforts to leave
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
that relationship and so that includes
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
filing for a divorce or seeking a
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
protective order so
 
02:04:25.490 --> 02:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
if the jumping off point is 50 50. and
 
02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:27.659 align:start position:0%
I've said this in prior testimony if the
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
jumping off point is 50 50. that is
 
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
something that will be used by abusers
 
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
to keep that victim in the home because
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
if that victim knows that they have been
 
02:04:41.149 --> 02:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
abused and that their kiddos have been
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
abused and that's there's potential for
 
02:04:45.890 --> 02:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
that child to be abused outside of their
 
02:04:48.530 --> 02:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
care if they know that the court is
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
likely to Grant you the abuser 50
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
percent of the parenting time what what
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
incentive does that victim have to leave
 
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
in that case because they won't because
 
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
at least a hundred percent of the time
 
02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
if both parents are in the home with the
 
02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
kiddos they can see what's going on they
 
02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
can intervene they can protect that
 
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
child but if it's 50 50 and they know
 
02:05:15.169 --> 02:05:15.179 align:start position:0%
that and the abuser says if you leave me
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know what's going to happen I'm
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to have Johnny I'm going to have
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
Susan 50 of the time and there's nothing
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
that you can do about it that is
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
terrifying absolutely terrifying because
 
02:05:28.850 --> 02:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
they will want to and then they will
 
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
want to stay and they will in that cycle
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
of abuse will continue
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
and parents will be hurt and kids will
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
be hurt so a hundred percent in my
 
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
opinion based on the work that we have
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
done on a daily basis across the state
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of victims yes the family
 
02:05:47.689 --> 02:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
court system can be weaponized yes 50 50
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
custody can be weaponized thank you

02:08:13.669 --> 02:08:13.679 align:start position:0%

02:08:23.570 --> 02:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
on May 13th 2022 I obtained a no
 
02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
stalking order against the ex-boyfriend
 
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
of my sister who currently this
 
02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
ex-boyfriend has custody of her son
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
on May 16 2022 the ex the ex's lawyer
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
sent my sister an email telling her that
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
because of my order my protective order
 
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
against his client his client will be
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
suspending her parenting time effective
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
immediately and reminded her after that
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
that she could not file a contempt
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
against his client for interfering with
 
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
her parenting time because she's
 
02:08:57.649 --> 02:08:57.659 align:start position:0%
defaulted out of the case and the court
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
advised her
 
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
at this point that she cannot file
 
02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:04.490 align:start position:0%
at this point that she cannot file
motions

02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
motions
 
02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:06.649 align:start position:0%
motions
um

02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
and has refused all of her emotions that
 
02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.099 align:start position:0%
she's attempted to file including
 
02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:13.139 align:start position:0%
contempt motions
 
02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
on June 2nd two weeks after they put in
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
their motion to suspend her parenting
 
02:09:21.770 --> 02:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
the judge granted their prayer to in
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
quote suspend mother's parenting time
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
and Skype calls until the sister's
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
protective order is dismissed
 
02:09:35.089 --> 02:09:35.099 align:start position:0%
this was he the judge did not modify the
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
prayer he just wrote granted underneath
 
02:09:39.770 --> 02:09:39.780 align:start position:0%
that prayer
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
um at this point he was predicting that
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
my case was going to be dismissed or he
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
knew that my case was going to be
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.599 --> 02:10:01.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:01.570 --> 02:10:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay I believe there's been extreme bias
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
in my sister's case and when there was a
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
warrant issued from my sister's arrest
 
02:10:11.450 --> 02:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
because she was protecting her immune
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
compromised son
 
02:10:16.010 --> 02:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
um from what his former doctors advised
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
her could seriously harm or even kill
 
02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
her son
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
um she had a warrant they obtained a
 
02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
warrant based on a lie that um they
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
filed with the police
 
02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
um she can explain more about that
 
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
my stocking case was petitioned in
 
02:10:40.679 --> 02:10:42.410 align:start position:0%
my stocking case was petitioned in
Manchester

02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
um I didn't tell my sister I didn't tell
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
either of my sisters that I was
 
02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.669 align:start position:0%
either of my sisters that I was
um

02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
filing the petition because they were
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
afraid they were afraid that what ended
 
02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
up happening happened and even then some
 
02:11:01.129 --> 02:11:01.139 align:start position:0%
um once I obtained the petition from
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester when they granted me the
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
stocking order that's when I told them I
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
had tried many things I my sister had
 
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
called her emailed or texted her ex
 
02:11:14.209 --> 02:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
warning him that if he didn't stop
 
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
harassing me or stalking me he stalked
 
02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
me four times
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
that she that I was going to do
 
02:11:23.570 --> 02:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
something I sent him I asked her to
 
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
email him and tell him that I would do
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
counseling with him to find out what was
 
02:11:29.689 --> 02:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
underlying why he felt uncomfortable
 
02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
around me as he claimed to her and I
 
02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
around me as he claimed to her and I
um

02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
I sent a deceased a cease and desist
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
order for him to sign he refused I sent
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
him in his attorney a letter an
 
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
agreement letter refused I did many
 
02:11:47.209 --> 02:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
things to try to avoid going to the
 
02:11:50.450 --> 02:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
court but he kept on harassing me
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and I finally went announced
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester they gave it to me and his
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
attorney put in to Manchester Court that
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
if they didn't transfer this case down
 
02:12:01.010 --> 02:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
to the same judge that has been
 
02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
to the same judge that has been
exclusively

02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
um overseeing my sister's case that it
 
02:12:10.450 --> 02:12:10.460 align:start position:0%
would take at least a three-hour trial
 
02:12:15.169 --> 02:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
for Manchester to hear my case and so
 
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
they he basically scared Manchester into
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
sending my case down to the judge that's
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
overseeing my sister's case who I feel
 
02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
has been very biased and has silenced me
 
02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
throughout my sister's case while I'm a
 
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
key witness and had been present at
 
02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
every event almost that has happened
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
since we lived together since my nephew
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
you was in the oven
 
02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:39.410 align:start position:0%
you was in the oven
um

02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:45.649 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:12:45.649 --> 02:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.659 --> 02:12:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.070 --> 02:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:56.810 align:start position:0%
Okay so
[Music]

02:12:56.810 --> 02:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:02.689 --> 02:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
I'm giving you a double portion of time
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
because there's two of you so you do
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more time but not
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
infinite so these pauses are counting
 
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
against your time I just need you to
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
move on okay okay
 
02:13:17.209 --> 02:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
um basically my case was moved down to
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the to this same judge and he
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
um he refused me all of my Witnesses
 
02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.750 align:start position:0%
um he refused me all of my Witnesses
basically

02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
um he
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
put things in the orders that I after
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
correct making the corrections in the
 
02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:36.050 align:start position:0%
correct making the corrections in the
um

02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
the hearings were still reflected even
 
02:13:40.250 --> 02:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
though he said he was making the
 
02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
corrections they were still reflected in
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the final order he dismissed my case
 
02:13:49.970 --> 02:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
um and during that time he did I asked
 
02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
the judge to modify the order so because
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
he was hurting a mother and child when
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
they didn't do anything wrong there was
 
02:13:57.770 --> 02:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
nothing that my sister did nothing that
 
02:13:59.930 --> 02:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
the child did it was basically to
 
02:14:02.810 --> 02:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
protect the man from potentially
 
02:14:05.089 --> 02:14:05.099 align:start position:0%
violating my order
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
um that her parenting was suspended and
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
this continued my case was continued
 
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
three times postponing continued three
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
times and
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
it went on for
 
02:14:21.050 --> 02:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
about 250 days and I kept asking the
 
02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
court to please modify and
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
um he wouldn't modify it he
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
um just kept continuing it as requested
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
by the um by the defendant or her ex
 
02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.550 align:start position:0%
by the um by the defendant or her ex
so

02:14:37.550 --> 02:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna lead you into my sister's
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
case because her her parenting was not
 
02:14:46.129 --> 02:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
only suspended but ultimately terminated
 
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
as a result of my water protecting this
 
02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:50.390 align:start position:0%
as a result of my water protecting this
man

02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
man
 
02:14:52.729 --> 02:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask you
 
02:14:56.450 --> 02:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
for specifics if you say the witnesses
 
02:14:59.089 --> 02:14:59.099 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to testify what
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses why were they not
 
02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
Ayan listed about 16 Witnesses so this
 
02:15:07.069 --> 02:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
is in the documents you gave us no the
 
02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:10.340 align:start position:0%
document you have is my sisters okay
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to email everything supporting
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
everything I say because that's the only
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
thing that will help us as we're
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
considering it we're not retrying the
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
case yes a broad generalization is of no
 
02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:22.729 align:start position:0%
case yes a broad generalization is of no
use

02:15:22.729 --> 02:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
so you have to give us specific details
 
02:15:29.149 --> 02:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
if a judge said no did someone object
 
02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
what was the objection what was the
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
judge's answer what did you do next
 
02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
those are the things that will help us
 
02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay okay so so when my case got moved
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
to Manchester I gave many reasons why it
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be my case was a civil case
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
and this judge after admitting that he
 
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to use any of his prior
 
02:15:53.330 --> 02:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
information knowledge of me in my
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
sister's case he wouldn't move it back
 
02:15:58.010 --> 02:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
to Manchester
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
um Manchester mistakenly moved my case
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
into the a different jurisdiction but he
 
02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
he held on to my case
 
02:16:10.970 --> 02:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
um and was the change of venue objected
 
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
to officially on the record many times
 
02:16:16.850 --> 02:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
motions and in hearings okay again go
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
specific on that if you can chair
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes one of the clerks
 
02:16:23.689 --> 02:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson thank you for
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%

02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
question which court was it moved to
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
Derry District Court thank you you're
 
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.509 align:start position:0%
Derry District Court thank you you're
welcome

02:16:31.509 --> 02:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
when I
 
02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:35.750 align:start position:0%
when I
um

02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
when I submitted a motion to violate the
 
02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.669 align:start position:0%
when I submitted a motion to violate the
defendant

02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
um on August 29th we had I had submitted
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
three three motions one was for him to
 
02:16:49.129 --> 02:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
release who we had tracking me on
 
02:16:49.139 --> 02:16:50.330 align:start position:0%
release who we had tracking me on
Facebook

02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
Facebook
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and another one was for because I had
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
thought that the order said for him to
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
attend counseling
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
um one was to order the counseling and
 
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
the other one was to violate him those
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
three two of those were supposed to be
 
02:17:06.049 --> 02:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
addressed on August 29th at our
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
pre-trial conference
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
um and The Judge first said he didn't he
 
02:17:13.310 --> 02:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware that they were and I and I
 
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
I showed him and he said okay in the
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
case summary or the order
 
02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and he he said that um
 
02:17:24.889 --> 02:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
he wasn't
 
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
in that hearing he refused to address
 
02:17:29.870 --> 02:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
those two contempts
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and he had already decided before
 
02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
that hearing that he wasn't going to
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
address the motion of violate and I
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
asked the judge why he wouldn't be
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
addressing that motion to violate
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
because that would take care of both
 
02:17:43.250 --> 02:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
cases what was happening in both cases
 
02:17:45.530 --> 02:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
at the same time and resolve probably
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
both cases and he didn't give me a
 
02:17:47.519 --> 02:17:48.469 align:start position:0%
both cases and he didn't give me a
reason

02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:17:52.129 --> 02:17:52.139 align:start position:0%
um he and he postponed all of the
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
Motions to the final hearing which was
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
delayed over 100 days after that I think
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
we now have 30 seconds to bring this to
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
a close okay
 
02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
both of you I gave you 10 minutes you
 
02:18:09.049 --> 02:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
have 30 seconds now to conclude your
 
02:18:09.059 --> 02:18:10.910 align:start position:0%
have 30 seconds now to conclude your
testimony

02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
if you are not providing us the
 
02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
we have your written testimony and I
 
02:18:35.169 --> 02:18:35.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
I guess I have just suggestions I would
 
02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
like to
 
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:42.599 align:start position:0%
um ask
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I I guess when you're a defaulted
 
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.190 align:start position:0%
um I I guess when you're a defaulted
party

02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
um how how to
 
02:18:54.589 --> 02:18:54.599 align:start position:0%
um how to I guess become not defaulted
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
um because they're holding that
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
um against me and
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
um using that in all my emotions
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
everything I I submit to the court it's
 
02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
um everything's always okay I'm gonna
 
02:19:10.250 --> 02:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
stop you now and
 
02:19:13.129 --> 02:19:13.139 align:start position:0%
I will give you the opportunity to
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
revise your testimony because it is not
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
helpful to us okay that's not an insult
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
against you it does not in any way
 
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
diminish what you're going through but
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not helpful testimony because when
 
02:19:29.089 --> 02:19:29.099 align:start position:0%
it says the judge has not afforded me
 
02:19:31.450 --> 02:19:31.460 align:start position:0%
the right to prevent present evidence
 
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
what kind of evidence no no I'm not I'm
 
02:19:38.089 --> 02:19:38.099 align:start position:0%
asking you to write this those are
 
02:19:38.099 --> 02:19:39.669 align:start position:0%
asking you to write this those are
specifics

02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
specifics
 
02:19:42.410 --> 02:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
ignoring All the Rules of Evidence which
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
rules are they
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't answer me put it in your new email
 
02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
to us he has denied me the right to ask
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
for Discovery do you have a copy of that
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
motion when was it presented were you
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
representing yourself or did you have
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
legal counsel we need specifics because
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
right now these are generalizations that
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
do not help us make changes
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
so as I've been saying and I know some
 
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
people are tired of me saying this every
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
week that is the testimony that will be
 
02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
helpful so I'll give you a shot at doing
 
02:20:19.969 --> 02:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
it doing a do-over
 
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
through a much better prepared detailed
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
testimony and that will be good for us
 
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:28.740 align:start position:0%

Derry District Family Court

Derry District Family Court
um

02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:29.809 --> 02:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen my kid in a year and I've
 
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
been paying child support and uh I'll
 
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
tell you what the judge did wrong there
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
is um she she put in a motion to file
 
02:21:40.610 --> 02:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
for uh to have a dismissed and move to
 
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in July of last year and
 
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
it was denied jurisdiction was in New
 
02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
it was denied jurisdiction was in New
Hampshire

02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
and then another judge came in in
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
November which I still haven't seen my
 
02:21:56.570 --> 02:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
kid the whole time and he heard the case
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
on an oral motion which is against the
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
law because you can't hear the same
 
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
motion with the same evidence over and
 
02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
over again uh New Hampshire Circuit
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
Family Court the division one two six
 
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration she didn't
 
02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
preserve her right for appeal
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the second judge overheard it and
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
then if you want to go into appellate
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
court cases you got Rasta Kelly versus
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
kirlwin out of North Carolina same
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
issues same motion second judge can't
 
02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
handle the same motion as a first judge
 
02:22:32.809 --> 02:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
because it was already denied and then
 
02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
um not only that it was an oral motion
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
to dismiss
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
and he was supposed to give me 30 days
 
02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
to prepare for the motion he heard it
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
that day so what I'm saying is if it's
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
all up to discretion of the judge
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
do you have those specific things that
 
02:22:54.410 --> 02:22:54.420 align:start position:0%

02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's in the Supreme Court right now I
 
02:22:59.630 --> 02:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
would like that much better than having
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
your phone
 
02:23:03.170 --> 02:23:03.180 align:start position:0%

02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%

that's me
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%

if that could be printed out and sent to
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
sent to us this would be very specific
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%

02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%

I'm saying is you know if uh people
 
02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
can't get
 
02:25:13.610 --> 02:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
it right and straighten out the system
 
02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
people are going to find a new system
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
that works for them understood right and
 
02:25:21.530 --> 02:25:21.540 align:start position:0%

the people that oversee it
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
so right now what I'm doing is I'm
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
putting in a uh
 
02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
um visitation enforcement agency not
 
02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%

visitation for their kids okay we're
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%

02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
through the appeal process so I'd prefer
 
02:26:49.370 --> 02:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
not to get into specifics
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
um I have had interactions excuse me you
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
are going to have to get into some
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
specifics well the testimony is to be
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to us correct correct not of my
 
02:27:01.969 --> 02:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
case specific details okay all right
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it works I have a
 
02:27:03.479 --> 02:27:04.250 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it works I have a
different

02:27:04.250 --> 02:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
um angle to present okay so I've had
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
interactions with the judicial conduct
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee which I was successful the
 
02:27:12.650 --> 02:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
professional conduct committee and the
 
02:27:14.330 --> 02:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
gal board
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
um my issue to present here today is
 
02:27:19.490 --> 02:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
about the process and the individual
 
02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
before me actually gave me a pretty good
 
02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
roadmap because what he was saying was
 
02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:25.730 align:start position:0%
roadmap because what he was saying was
correct

02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
um when you go into a courthouse you
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
sort of have expectations or there's
 
02:27:33.290 --> 02:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
clear guidance and that's the problem
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the family court and what he's
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
saying is that a judge held a hearing
 
02:27:40.969 --> 02:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
prematurely and I see that happen all
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
the time and it is scary because the
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
process in family court is you go in for
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
your first appearance then you have a
 
02:27:50.330 --> 02:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
temporary hearing then you have a
 
02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
scheduling hearing then you have perhaps
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
motion hearing then your final hearing
 
02:27:55.969 --> 02:27:55.979 align:start position:0%
when you go in for the scheduling
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
conference hearing you are expecting to
 
02:28:00.530 --> 02:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
set dates for discovery
 
02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
what the court is doing is they call it
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
suaspante or on its own they have a
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
emotion hearing and I wouldn't have
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
believed it if I didn't read the
 
02:28:16.010 --> 02:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
transcript myself but I've seen two
 
02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
different courts completely strip a
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
parent of their parental rights in this
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
status conference and I listened to the
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
attorney object object object it was a
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
due process violation and the courts
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
still do it and that's my issue with
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
discretion is if I say to you
 
02:28:38.450 --> 02:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
you know you have to do something in a
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable fashion what does reasonable
 
02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
mean to you because if it has a sense of
 
02:28:46.429 --> 02:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
urgency I say 24 hours it would be
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
helpful in those cases that you alluded
 
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
to if you could email us with specifics
 
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
when what judge because I can see
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
examples when uh I would have ruled that
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
way I can also see examples when that
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
was an incorrect ruling but I can't
 
02:29:05.929 --> 02:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
decide about what you've said because I
 
02:29:08.510 --> 02:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
don't have enough specifics so to be
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
helpful again if you would give us that
 
02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
and you can email the committee that
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
would open up some possibilities for us
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
excellent I I have a transcript and I'll
 
02:29:21.050 --> 02:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
point out to the specific paragraphs
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
that you guys don't have to go through a
 
02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
200-page transcript thank you difficult
 
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
and my last and final point is the
 
02:29:32.290 --> 02:29:32.300 align:start position:0%
process on gal PCC
 
02:29:34.730 --> 02:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
issues if you have an issue with your
 
02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
gal the court says go to the gal board
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
but what you don't know is that the gal
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
board will not hear a complaint about a
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
gal in an ongoing case my case lasted
 
02:29:47.929 --> 02:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
for four years I could not file a
 
02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
complaint I filed with the PCC they said
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
go to the JC's go to the gal board now
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I can file guess what I have a
 
02:29:59.330 --> 02:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
statute of limitation issue now I can't
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
file so essentially the gal board is
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
really tying the hands of litigants to
 
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
file a legitimate complaint
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.469 --> 02:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
if you could give us a one-pager about
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
what you just said about gal that would
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful too because we could look at
 
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
that specific issue of how do you
 
02:30:24.889 --> 02:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
complain against the gal apparently only
 
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
when it's too late yeah and the other
 
02:30:28.969 --> 02:30:28.979 align:start position:0%
issue is that you're sworn to
 
02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
confidentiality on all of these
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
complaints that you make so in my
 
02:30:37.309 --> 02:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee complaint I
 
02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to tell a soul that I
 
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
had complained about this judge but what
 
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
she was allowed to do
 
02:30:45.410 --> 02:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
was go back to that courtroom and train
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
a new judge to take over my case
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
so clearly there
 
02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
I can't prove it but in the mind I would
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
think that there's a bias
 
02:30:57.530 --> 02:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
from that judge and there's also
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
the issue on judges
 
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
I noticed that there's a shortage and I
 
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
have you know sent emails to some
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
attorneys that I've dealt with that are
 
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
just amazing and would be amazing judges
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
but the problem and I don't think you
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
would see this is
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
old school attorneys don't type their
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
own stuff they have secretaries they
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes struggle with attaching
 
02:31:23.330 --> 02:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
something to an email if they become a
 
02:31:26.330 --> 02:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
judge they're a one man or one woman
 
02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
show and they don't have the capability
 
02:31:32.690 --> 02:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
of drafting all of their orders so
 
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps if you look at the process it
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
might make sense to attract new judges
 
02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
to offer a law Clerk or a secretary
 
02:31:42.530 --> 02:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
somebody who could assist them because
 
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts there's layers to get
 
02:31:46.849 --> 02:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
through you go through a case manager
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
all of these layers so when you get to
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
the judge it's not such a heavy burden
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're going straight to
 
02:31:56.090 --> 02:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
a judge and saying solve all of our
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
problems if we're pro se and we don't
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
have child support can you help us
 
02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do it it's just too
 
02:32:03.110 --> 02:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
much on the judges and I think the
 
02:32:06.370 --> 02:32:06.380 align:start position:0%
process can be expedited and
 
02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
you know more beneficial if there were
 
02:32:11.929 --> 02:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
layers to assist that judge okay thank
 
02:32:13.610 --> 02:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
you thank you I hope this will be in the
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
written wow you're good look at that uh
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be in your written testimony too
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
because I can see a couple things right
 
02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
now that'll be very helpful as we start
 
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
to consider things so thank you so much
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%

02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
I um I have a I have a daughter she's 32
 
02:33:17.330 --> 02:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
years old I've seen her total of 70
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
minutes in the last 25 years
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
I've been working
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
um with non-custodial parents or
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
dependencies I like to call them
 
02:33:29.570 --> 02:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
to help them to re-establish a
 
02:33:31.849 --> 02:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
relationship with their children and
 
02:33:33.710 --> 02:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot of good things happening
 
02:33:35.929 --> 02:33:35.939 align:start position:0%
with that um
 
02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's amazing what I've seen in my work I
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't have any uh qualifications of not
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
a paralegal or a lawyer or anything like
 
02:33:45.410 --> 02:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
that but
 
02:33:48.650 --> 02:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
what I've seen through my own education
 
02:33:51.670 --> 02:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:33:55.070 --> 02:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
there's there are a lot of discrepancies
 
02:33:57.130 --> 02:33:57.140 align:start position:0%
that don't make sense
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
the the courts are given Financial
 
02:34:03.370 --> 02:34:03.380 align:start position:0%
incentives uh to collect child support
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the agencies are given incentives to
 
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
remove children from families
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
but there's no money given to visitation
 
02:34:14.690 --> 02:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement like something like Mrs
 
02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
state was talked about I'm working I'm
 
02:34:19.370 --> 02:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
actually I'm working with the state
 
02:34:21.050 --> 02:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
senator and a couple of Representatives
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me and a member of the executive
 
02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:24.889 align:start position:0%
excuse me and a member of the executive
account

02:34:24.889 --> 02:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
02:34:30.050 --> 02:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
to create a visitation enforcement agent
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
here in New York and I'm working with
 
02:34:35.450 --> 02:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
other people in different states to do
 
02:34:37.250 --> 02:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
the same thing there
 
02:34:37.260 --> 02:34:37.969 align:start position:0%
the same thing there
um

02:34:37.969 --> 02:34:37.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:41.389 --> 02:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's just it's very confusing I I got
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
divorced in 1992 and I went into court
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
thinking I knew everything and I didn't
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
realize that you know
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
you don't get if you can afford a lawyer
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
you don't get one
 
02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:53.570 align:start position:0%
you don't get one
um

02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
and there's no jury trial I get
 
02:34:58.250 --> 02:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
convicted twice for being behind on my
 
02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
child support no jury trial or anything
 
02:35:03.050 --> 02:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
and you know it's just you pay it or
 
02:35:05.809 --> 02:35:05.819 align:start position:0%
else and I spent over a hundred thousand
 
02:35:08.210 --> 02:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
dollars of Child Support without having
 
02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
any contact with my daughter because of
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
false allegations
 
02:35:16.490 --> 02:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
my ex-wife accused me of something and
 
02:35:18.170 --> 02:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
she didn't have to prove it happened I
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
had to prove it didn't I don't
 
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
understand that at all do you have a
 
02:35:26.809 --> 02:35:26.819 align:start position:0%
date when that took place in the uh we
 
02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
our visit stopped in 1997 in 1998
 
02:35:33.530 --> 02:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
because it would be uh very helpful just
 
02:35:35.210 --> 02:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
for the audience we are not receiving
 
02:35:37.730 --> 02:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
any more pink cards today we are already
 
02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:40.140 align:start position:0%

02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
one out for next week go ahead
 
02:35:44.570 --> 02:35:44.580 align:start position:0%

02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
the documentary you would need to be
 
02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
written out and sent to the committee or
 
02:35:56.450 --> 02:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.150 --> 02:35:59.160 align:start position:0%

there okay find out why if we can answer
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
this why is visitation not in the best
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
with both parents I wouldn't we would
 
02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
not know that it sounds like the
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
decision was made in Massachusetts well
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
no it's everywhere you I mean there's no
 
02:36:27.889 --> 02:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
visitation enforcement agent
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%

02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to bring up a couple of
 
02:37:44.270 --> 02:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
things that have come up this morning
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
with Catherine she said that
 
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
um a lot of different facts that I think
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
are very misleading and as you know
 
02:37:53.929 --> 02:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
um chair Pearson that I've been up here
 
02:37:55.210 --> 02:37:55.220 align:start position:0%
several times
 
02:37:58.849 --> 02:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
and I do actually have a letter from the
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee it's taken
 
02:38:04.849 --> 02:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
many many times many tries on my case
 
02:38:08.270 --> 02:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
and some of you are new here based on my
 
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
case so I am the Silva V Silva case and
 
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
in my case I've been to several
 
02:38:15.410 --> 02:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
different bad judges I've I've
 
02:38:17.330 --> 02:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at the very beginning of
 
02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
my divorce I do believe that there's a
 
02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
problem with the um the good old boys
 
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
club committee uh where my opposing
 
02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:26.809 align:start position:0%
club committee uh where my opposing
councils

02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
councils
 
02:38:26.819 --> 02:39:27.610 align:start position:0%
councils
um

02:39:27.610 --> 02:39:27.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
inappropriately I believe that again
 
02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:31.550 align:start position:0%
inappropriately I believe that again
specific

02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:39:33.290 --> 02:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
I have them all here got them all and
 
02:39:34.849 --> 02:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
we're going to get one I'll give you the
 
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
copies of it I'm trying to start like um
 
02:39:39.889 --> 02:39:39.899 align:start position:0%
scratch the surface of it because again
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
I had 29 hearings I had five Supreme
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
Court appeals my biggest problem is I
 
02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
had two judges that both got disbarred
 
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
while one was a marital Master which we
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
no longer have it went to the um to the
 
02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
court they said that they were not gonna
 
02:39:59.450 --> 02:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
um first of all I was told that I
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
had a hobby and to go out and get a real
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
job that they took away child support
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
and alimony which they had no right
 
02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
doing that is to support the children
 
02:40:11.809 --> 02:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
they took away my alimony because of my
 
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
business there's been a lot of judicial
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
Discretions and she even said on the
 
02:40:17.870 --> 02:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
bench that she should not be making this
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
Rule and without looking at the law that
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
applies to alimony but she said
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of the relationship it
 
02:40:25.610 --> 02:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if it's a business deal
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
you're losing it and after going to the
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court five times do we have a
 
02:40:34.250 --> 02:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
place cited where somebody could go back
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and hear that said yes yep actually and
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
you've transcribed that and referenced
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
it in your notes yep actually um the
 
02:40:44.570 --> 02:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
other problem that I do have
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
um is the first comment that I had
 
02:40:52.010 --> 02:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
received from the first judge that was
 
02:40:54.170 --> 02:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
not on transcript but I do have
 
02:40:56.270 --> 02:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
witnesses that have heard it
 
02:40:57.410 --> 02:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
02:40:59.450 --> 02:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
um comments which again
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
I have a Judicial conduct complaint here
 
02:41:05.210 --> 02:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
that marital Master uh delpra
 
02:41:07.370 --> 02:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
specifically said that he was not going
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
to fix the reman orders that came from
 
02:41:10.910 --> 02:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
because I was a thorn in his side he
 
02:41:17.210 --> 02:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
said that um he did not want to reopen
 
02:41:19.070 --> 02:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
the can of worms on my case because it's
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
been so many years so even though they
 
02:41:24.349 --> 02:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
had very explicit orders from the
 
02:41:27.530 --> 02:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to fix my case he said he
 
02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
was not reopening that can of worms was
 
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
that conveyed to someone who works in
 
02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court office you know that's
 
02:41:39.050 --> 02:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
a good question so it was heard by the
 
02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee on record we
 
02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
have no transcript no audio that has
 
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
that specific
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
saying but Robert middleholzer and it
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
also says here these comments were
 
02:41:54.889 --> 02:41:54.899 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the committee upon its
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
review of the audio recordings of the
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
above herons so as I had sat before you
 
02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
many times to tell you that there's been
 
02:42:05.630 --> 02:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
so many processes where are not being
 
02:42:08.330 --> 02:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
followed for instance like I said the
 
02:42:10.969 --> 02:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court gave them explicit
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
instructions I have the Supreme Court
 
02:42:16.490 --> 02:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
ruling here that says exactly what I
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
what it's due to me and my children it
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
went down to the trial court the trial
 
02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
court said nope you don't deserve it
 
02:42:27.170 --> 02:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
again said on on record okay did you
 
02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
then rat that Court out to the Supreme
 
02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
Court I did okay I went again five times
 
02:42:37.490 --> 02:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court again I got another
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
remand that says I gave you explicit
 
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
instructions to fix this case and you
 
02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
know what the the next judge did he said
 
02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
I am not reopening this can of worms
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
so it's been a trend where I was biased
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
up against at the very beginning and I
 
02:42:57.490 --> 02:42:57.500 align:start position:0%
feel like the court is at playing field
 
02:43:00.290 --> 02:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
where otherwise these people would be
 
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
put in jail for instance my ex
 
02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
originally had given me as false 30
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
seconds left sorry uh false TVs fall
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
police report false um
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
court cases false gcyf reports criminal
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
threatening conspiracies I even had a DV
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
put against me which when I went into
 
02:43:21.650 --> 02:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
court the judge said he's the one that
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
should have this he's preventing your
 
02:43:26.090 --> 02:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
business he's stopping your your funds
 
02:43:27.950 --> 02:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
from coming in he's shutting down your
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
booking engines he's the one that's he's
 
02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
doing that and Contin can you continue
 
02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
continuing so he actually turned around
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
and weaponized that restraint in order
 
02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
that the judge put on him to turn it
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
around on
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we will be looking forward to
 
02:43:47.330 --> 02:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
getting your documentation of all of
 
02:43:50.330 --> 02:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
this because this is the kind of stuff
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
02:43:54.770 --> 02:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
not in a specific case mind you we can't
 
02:43:57.530 --> 02:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
do that but to say whoa if this kind of
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
thing is happening and somebody else has
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
given us documentation maybe we got a
 
02:44:05.389 --> 02:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be fixed here so
 
02:44:08.270 --> 02:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay I've cut your mic off so if you
 
02:44:10.610 --> 02:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
would uh if you have copies please give
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
them to the last one in the row and if
 
02:44:15.230 --> 02:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
you don't have enough then you know
 
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
where we live
 
02:44:22.130 --> 02:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:24.290 --> 02:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
so if you got handouts
 
02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.370 --> 02:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
and you use the a rainbow of such
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
beautiful paper as I recalled
 
02:44:37.550 --> 02:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:39.650 --> 02:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
and while she's doing that
 
02:44:45.889 --> 02:44:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:48.889 --> 02:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:04.809 --> 02:45:04.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
and you're going to need to turn the mic
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
back on
 
02:45:11.570 --> 02:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
as I had killed it
 
02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
as I had killed it
boom

02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
boom
 
02:45:16.130 --> 02:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
hello hello my name is Robert tanguin
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
I've spoken before this committee before
 
02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
and I I do appreciate it
 
02:45:23.570 --> 02:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to actually honor your work
 
02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:24.770 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to actually honor your work
um

02:45:24.770 --> 02:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Miss gay uh for kind of
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
putting this together I've spoken with
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
the honorable uh Mr David Beckford
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh who drafted in 2005
 
02:45:41.050 --> 02:45:41.060 align:start position:0%
uh was part of one of the drafters of
 
02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
461a parental rights and
 
02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities which is very important
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I want to take this time
 
02:45:52.730 --> 02:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
to kind of deflect
 
02:45:55.550 --> 02:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
um some of what is going on especially
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
with the lady who spoke for 45 minutes
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
um with really any without any
 
02:46:02.330 --> 02:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated without any
 
02:46:04.969 --> 02:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
substantiated evidence
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
um the courts are not the family Court's
 
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
specific are not working uh following
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
their rules one of the first rules in
 
02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
first appearance is that
 
02:46:19.250 --> 02:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
it must be before a judge in the family
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
court that is Rule 211. first appearance
 
02:46:25.670 --> 02:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
that did not happen in my case and it
 
02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
does not happen if you could hold up for
 
02:46:28.670 --> 02:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
a minute I want to make sure this gets
 
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
into our record and we got a little
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
paper jam up here but I I'd like this
 
02:46:36.730 --> 02:46:36.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.889 --> 02:46:39.899 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're stopping the clock yeah
 
02:46:44.570 --> 02:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm good that way I appreciate it okay
 
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
and we're going there we go okay so 211
 
02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
first appearances in the family Rules
 
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
you guys need to read the family Rules
 
02:46:52.610 --> 02:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's not that hard it's not that
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
complicated rules aren't magic you guys
 
02:46:56.929 --> 02:46:56.939 align:start position:0%
know you guys know laws
 
02:46:59.330 --> 02:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and that's what you do and uh it's a
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
very important part of the foundation of
 
02:47:03.230 --> 02:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
our democracy and the reason why we're
 
02:47:04.969 --> 02:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
not ripping each other apart
 
02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
what's happening when the rules aren't
 
02:47:08.510 --> 02:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
followed is that we're ripping each
 
02:47:11.030 --> 02:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
other apart in family courts
 
02:47:14.450 --> 02:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
so first appearance you must have a
 
02:47:16.730 --> 02:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
hearing before a judge and you can read
 
02:47:18.050 --> 02:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
I could read a word for word but
 
02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
basically they're supposed to order
 
02:47:19.140 --> 02:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
basically they're supposed to order
mediation

02:47:20.450 --> 02:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
to prevent this and they're saying that
 
02:47:24.469 --> 02:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
oh mediation is available in my specific
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
case a parenting uh petition was not
 
02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.510 align:start position:0%
case a parenting uh petition was not
filed

02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh until September of 2022
 
02:47:34.910 --> 02:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then I went through the first
 
02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:35.990 align:start position:0%
and then I went through the first
appearance

02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
appearance
 
02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
and then the domestic violence was filed
 
02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
against me fictitiously uh to gain
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
strategic advantage in the court case to
 
02:47:45.359 --> 02:47:46.790 align:start position:0%
strategic advantage in the court case to
preclude

02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
preclude
 
02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:48.170 align:start position:0%
preclude
mediation

02:47:48.170 --> 02:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
mediation
 
02:47:50.270 --> 02:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
to preclude it specifically because
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's the only way the court cannot
 
02:47:55.070 --> 02:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
order mediation and it was done by a
 
02:47:57.170 --> 02:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
lawyer see the lawyers are all in on it
 
02:47:59.330 --> 02:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
together lawyers become judges and
 
02:48:01.309 --> 02:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
there's tons of proof on that and you
 
02:48:02.750 --> 02:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
can figure that out and that's what
 
02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
we're having is an issue right now where
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
the lawyers are getting together to get
 
02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
money from domestic violence they get
 
02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
money from the state the lady who
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
testified earlier gets money from the
 
02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:15.710 align:start position:0%
testified earlier gets money from the
state

02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
okay if you could suspend for a minute
 
02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask one of my Clerks
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Tanguay I just wanted to clarify
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so when was I I know you stated that
 
02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
in September of 2022 a parenting plan
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
was filed when was your case first how
 
02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
filed and when was the domestic violence
 
02:48:42.710 --> 02:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
petition filed so they actually filed ex
 
02:48:46.809 --> 02:48:46.819 align:start position:0%
parte on September
 
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.809 --> 02:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
I roughly roughly we'll give that
 
02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
roughly uh if it was at the beginning of
 
02:48:57.290 --> 02:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
mid September
 
02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
I did not hear about it until I filed
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
with the mother a demand letter
 
02:49:06.349 --> 02:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
because I had grievances that's the
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
court in good faith you're supposed to
 
02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
November 30th a domestic violence
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
petition was filed after my
 
02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh November 28th
 
02:49:20.330 --> 02:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
motion with the court
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
to have them order mediation as they're
 
02:49:25.010 --> 02:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
so they did that in direct response
 
02:49:29.330 --> 02:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes thank
 
02:49:31.490 --> 02:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
um so that's just one example I guess
 
02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
with the main point of my time that I
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
want to make is uh
 
02:49:40.250 --> 02:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
the best course of action
 
02:49:43.250 --> 02:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
to resolve because obviously family at
 
02:49:44.929 --> 02:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
one time children were consider property
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so were women and uh that's
 
02:49:50.090 --> 02:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
obviously important thing uh to
 
02:49:51.889 --> 02:49:51.899 align:start position:0%
understand the not property but where
 
02:49:53.290 --> 02:49:53.300 align:start position:0%
are they
 
02:49:56.929 --> 02:49:56.939 align:start position:0%
173b is unconstitutional it needs to be
 
02:49:58.849 --> 02:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
repealed it needs to be taken out of the
 
02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
family courts the proper procedure is to
 
02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
if you're a victim you're scared you
 
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
call the police the police need to do
 
02:50:08.990 --> 02:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
their job the police are funded by local
 
02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:10.730 align:start position:0%
their job the police are funded by local
municipalities

02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
what is happening with 173b is we're
 
02:50:15.830 --> 02:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually forcing the state to take on
 
02:50:18.469 --> 02:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
this liability because every single
 
02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
judge is a state employee and every
 
02:50:22.610 --> 02:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
person in the court is a state employee
 
02:50:25.010 --> 02:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
so my only restitution is not to go and
 
02:50:26.929 --> 02:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
mess around with judicial review
 
02:50:29.690 --> 02:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
committee and file complaints if you
 
02:50:31.490 --> 02:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
read the Constitution is to sue the
 
02:50:33.889 --> 02:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um another thing I wrote on every one of
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
those papers so what you're seeing is a
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
complaint with the Manchester Police
 
02:50:38.160 --> 02:50:39.290 align:start position:0%
complaint with the Manchester Police
Department

02:50:39.290 --> 02:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:50:41.929 --> 02:50:41.939 align:start position:0%
and they've hired a lawyer and they're
 
02:50:44.330 --> 02:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
not doing it it's still just refusing to
 
02:50:48.349 --> 02:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh provide service I have no place to go
 
02:50:48.359 --> 02:50:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh provide service I have no place to go
um

02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
on top of that is Miller V Todd Miller V
 
02:50:54.410 --> 02:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
Todd is a very famous case
 
02:50:56.450 --> 02:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
um it's about parental alienation if you
 
02:50:58.370 --> 02:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
do you know how I remembered it
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
I typed in Miller V finger's daughter NH
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that's disgusting but that's
 
02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
what I had to type in to remember
 
02:51:10.429 --> 02:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
and in it eight years a father was
 
02:51:12.650 --> 02:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
falsely accused of
 
02:51:15.290 --> 02:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
molesting his children the children were
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
alienated they believed that they were
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
molested and there's a whole bunch of
 
02:51:21.349 --> 02:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
case law about it but what we've found
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
the mother and their parents basically
 
02:51:26.750 --> 02:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
manipulated the children for eight years
 
02:51:29.090 --> 02:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
and abused the children to take the
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
custody back and forth and it involves
 
02:51:33.050 --> 02:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
um for the last 30 seconds thank you sir
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate it the last thing I
 
02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
want to do is uh I want to read
 
02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:43.070 align:start position:0%
want to do is uh I want to read
uh

02:51:43.070 --> 02:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh the orders which are false uh and
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
this should be criminal a penalty
 
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
this is what I was accused of this is
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
what the mathematical and physically
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
impossible statements initiated 1100
 
02:51:58.849 --> 02:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
texts to Plaintiff in September 2022
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%

02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
phone calls per puberty does include
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
numbers she refused to answer
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
he believes he has a constitutional
 
02:52:10.250 --> 02:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
right to see his children morning and
 
02:52:13.610 --> 02:52:13.620 align:start position:0%

02:52:16.490 --> 02:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
her home she refuses he refuses to exit
 
02:52:17.929 --> 02:52:17.939 align:start position:0%

kneeling
 
02:52:25.010 --> 02:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
and praying looking into a slider
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
the slider doesn't exist
 
02:52:30.490 --> 02:52:30.500 align:start position:0%
okay wait until the Court's attention
 
02:52:33.050 --> 02:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
15 seconds and then the mic goes away
 
02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir I brought to the Court's
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
attention with three pleadings they
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
denied it that is with the police right
 
02:52:41.150 --> 02:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
now the Manchester police
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
as orders I can't see my children I
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
can't see my children and so on so okay
 
02:52:48.410 --> 02:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
thank you now it's on my dime uh could
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
you give a better a fuller reference for
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
Miller V Todd
 
02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh Miller I think it's 2011.
 
02:52:57.710 --> 02:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't have that I could send it to
 
02:52:59.870 --> 02:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
you but you can just type in Miller Vito
 
02:53:02.269 --> 02:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
what's that famous it's that famous it's
 
02:53:04.250 --> 02:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
on the library the court Library website
 
02:53:06.889 --> 02:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
and that the end result was that
 
02:53:06.899 --> 02:53:08.630 align:start position:0%
and that the end result was that
alienation

02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
alienation
 
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
is just as detrimental to the child's
 
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
welfare as the actual abuse itself and
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
this is the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:53:17.929 --> 02:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
so this is a New Hampshire case we're
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
circling around it and it looks like
 
02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
2011. I bet that will be good any
 
02:53:24.590 --> 02:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr tengue the chair
 
02:53:27.050 --> 02:53:27.060 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Smith thank
 
02:53:28.670 --> 02:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
you just a quick question several times
 
02:53:31.910 --> 02:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
you said that mediation is required
 
02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
um can you give me the citation for that
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's uh it it's in the family
 
02:53:39.410 --> 02:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
court rules
 
02:53:41.690 --> 02:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
that you can order it I don't know if
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's in 461a so that's very important
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
um but the only thing that precludes
 
02:53:49.370 --> 02:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
that and I can provide that to the uh
 
02:53:52.429 --> 02:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
committee is a filing a fighting of
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
domestic violence so 173b is
 
02:53:58.849 --> 02:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because what happens is
 
02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
the process is someone writes a
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
complaint I I just I just I just needed
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%

02:54:49.790 --> 02:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
committee for staying late to hear more
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
testimony today I've been precluded from
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
testifying before because there were too
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
many people in the time had been filled
 
02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
up so I appreciate what you're doing
 
02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
the outcome that we're I'm really hoping
 
02:55:04.250 --> 02:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
for is that someone will investigate my
 
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
case in other cases going on in Carroll
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
County over the last number of years
 
02:55:09.230 --> 02:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
from the Judiciary Committee
 
02:55:12.290 --> 02:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
specifically that may take a closer look
 
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
at some of the things that are going on
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
in our County I think that you'll find
 
02:55:19.870 --> 02:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
so many irregularities that will
 
02:55:22.370 --> 02:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
justify your time in looking at some of
 
02:55:28.090 --> 02:55:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.170 --> 02:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
irregularities happened right at the
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of the case which was filed in
 
02:55:34.330 --> 02:55:34.340 align:start position:0%
August of
 
02:55:37.809 --> 02:55:37.819 align:start position:0%
2016. I was the petitioner on that case
 
02:55:40.490 --> 02:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh later
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
I was accused of domestic violence and
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
that case was started
 
02:55:49.490 --> 02:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
um by my son's mother in March of 2017.
 
02:55:53.570 --> 02:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
I ex I requested expedited hearings and
 
02:55:55.370 --> 02:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
if the committee would get the
 
02:56:00.110 --> 02:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
transcripts from April 6th of 2017 and
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
then again from April 10th of 2017 I
 
02:56:05.210 --> 02:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
think you'll see that what you're
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from the
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh interested parties that have
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
presented at the beginning of these
 
02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
meetings is that we're not seeing a
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
rubber meets the road
 
02:56:17.450 --> 02:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
action and what you're being told is
 
02:56:19.130 --> 02:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
happening in the courts I think if you
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
read those two transcripts you'll be
 
02:56:22.750 --> 02:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
very surprised at what you read
 
02:56:26.929 --> 02:56:26.939 align:start position:0%
specifically you'll see that I was held
 
02:56:29.450 --> 02:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
to a very specific standard of of
 
02:56:31.849 --> 02:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
questioning that only a lawyer would be
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
able to know so we often hear that the
 
02:56:37.250 --> 02:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence aren't applying but I
 
02:56:40.969 --> 02:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
was not informed of direct questioning
 
02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
indirect questioning cross-examination
 
02:56:46.610 --> 02:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
but you'll see that I was held to a very
 
02:56:49.610 --> 02:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
very specific standard in that case and
 
02:56:52.730 --> 02:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
that began just a long laundry list of
 
02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
abuses irregularities due process
 
02:56:57.469 --> 02:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
violations please put me in all of those
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
files that you have I'm not sure unless
 
02:57:04.370 --> 02:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to volunteer that we
 
02:57:06.769 --> 02:57:06.779 align:start position:0%
will be getting those transcripts we
 
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
might suggest rather that you do because
 
02:57:13.070 --> 02:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
if every person who testifies says you
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
guys got to go get the transcripts uh
 
02:57:18.950 --> 02:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I won't have time I thought
 
02:57:20.269 --> 02:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's what you had said at the
 
02:57:22.070 --> 02:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
organizational meetings that you would
 
02:57:23.809 --> 02:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
be looking at over the summer I'm happy
 
02:57:25.610 --> 02:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
to provide those for you thank you very
 
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
much and if I was confusing I apologize
 
02:57:30.170 --> 02:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
for that that'll be very helpful because
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
no problem I had previously mentioned in
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
the organizational meeting that what
 
02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
happened in the hearing that day was
 
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
related to RSA 106 h14 as its relates to
 
02:57:51.530 --> 02:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 calls right
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
so in that hearing
 
02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
um specifically the DV hearing which was
 
02:57:59.690 --> 02:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
held on April 10th I was not allowed to
 
02:58:02.330 --> 02:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
use evidence to refute the allegations
 
02:58:05.929 --> 02:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
made against me now that was allowed in
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
a later 20 months later
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
Superior Court case where I was charged
 
02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
criminally and without the protection of
 
02:58:16.370 --> 02:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
the trial by jury one of the few rights
 
02:58:18.769 --> 02:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
that still stands in the state of New
 
02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the government would have put
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
me in prison for three to seven years on
 
02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
completely false allegations
 
02:58:28.370 --> 02:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
did you see a difference between civil
 
02:58:30.410 --> 02:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
court and Criminal Court in the way that
 
02:58:32.690 --> 02:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
they handle that absolutely and that's
 
02:58:35.389 --> 02:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
why I'm here to testify today in
 
02:58:38.030 --> 02:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
confirming with Mr tangway that I have
 
02:58:39.230 --> 02:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
felt that
 
02:58:42.530 --> 02:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh the domestic violence RSA I believe
 
02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's 173 B is unconstitutional I believe
 
02:58:50.690 --> 02:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
that it's designed to take away all of
 
02:58:52.670 --> 02:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
my constitutional rights aside from
 
02:58:55.250 --> 02:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
quartering soldiers in my home it's
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
really designed to make it civil law
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
where someone can make accusations
 
02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
against me but my understanding is that
 
02:59:03.170 --> 02:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
civil law was meant to be a money
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
problem if you owe me five hundred
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
dollars we go to civil court not take my
 
02:59:09.710 --> 02:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
child away from having a meaningful
 
02:59:12.889 --> 02:59:12.899 align:start position:0%
relationship with my family his cousins
 
02:59:17.330 --> 02:59:17.340 align:start position:0%
my 84 year old father his my nieces it
 
02:59:19.610 --> 02:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
wasn't meant to be that way especially
 
02:59:22.250 --> 02:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
for false allegations which are provable
 
02:59:25.510 --> 02:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
is false because the 911
 
02:59:27.830 --> 02:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
completion has still been withheld from
 
02:59:30.110 --> 02:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
me and the irregularities and due
 
02:59:32.570 --> 02:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
process violations in my case will show
 
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
you that despite numerous motions for
 
02:59:38.929 --> 02:59:38.939 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and also appeals before
 
02:59:42.349 --> 02:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court the 9-1-1 call has
 
02:59:44.269 --> 02:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
never been allowed to enter into
 
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
evidence in the family court or the
 
02:59:51.889 --> 02:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case ever with
 
02:59:53.570 --> 02:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
multiple pieces that you will all
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
receive in those motions it's horrendous
 
02:59:59.809 --> 02:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
it's affecting and now next week an 11
 
03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
year old child this has been going on
 
03:00:05.450 --> 03:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
for six weeks six years and it's it's
 
03:00:08.450 --> 03:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
impressing itself upon the chair and and
 
03:00:11.450 --> 03:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
I would think others as well that if the
 
03:00:13.610 --> 03:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
the penalty and I think loss of
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
fellowship with one's family members is
 
03:00:18.769 --> 03:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
a heavy penalty it may not be called a
 
03:00:21.530 --> 03:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
penalty but you're being penalized is of
 
03:00:25.010 --> 03:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
such an order that some of the demands
 
03:00:28.190 --> 03:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
and expenses of Criminal Court may need
 
03:00:29.809 --> 03:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
to kick in
 
03:00:32.510 --> 03:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
um in Criminal Court you've got people
 
03:00:34.490 --> 03:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
doing all the investigating on the
 
03:00:36.849 --> 03:00:36.859 align:start position:0%
state's dime in civil court you don't
 
03:00:40.730 --> 03:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to have such an
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
outcome of this level then I could see a
 
03:00:48.650 --> 03:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
case being made for this being treated
 
03:00:50.389 --> 03:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
in some ways as if it was a criminal
 
03:00:54.769 --> 03:00:54.779 align:start position:0%
issue with jury with investigators paid
 
03:00:58.790 --> 03:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
for and so on I think I'm reflecting you
 
03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
back am I
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
I think that there definitely needs to
 
03:01:04.849 --> 03:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
be changed changed because the benches
 
03:01:07.309 --> 03:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
for sale in New Hampshire and it's this
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
has reached a level of public corruption
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
this isn't just rule problems this this
 
03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 call
 
03:01:16.370 --> 03:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
being altered is really a criminal
 
03:01:18.769 --> 03:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
matter well we're not going to be able
 
03:01:21.530 --> 03:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
to go into that as a committee however
 
03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
certainly we will look at whether there
 
03:01:27.469 --> 03:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
seems to be some serious need for Rural
 
03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
revision is there anyone who has a
 
03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:30.730 align:start position:0%
revision is there anyone who has a
question

03:01:30.730 --> 03:01:30.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh of our testifier seeing none I want
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
to thank you for coming back and giving
 
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
us some more and we'll look for specific
 
03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:40.370 align:start position:0%
us some more and we'll look for specific
details

03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
details
 
03:01:43.010 --> 03:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
03:01:45.170 --> 03:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I adjourn half an hour late thank you
 
03:01:47.389 --> 03:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
for people staying I've already got some
 
03:01:50.090 --> 03:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
pink cards who will testify next week if
 
03:01:52.010 --> 03:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's any more I'll take them until I
