have spring break I have just returned
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
from my own so I'm a little T and happy
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
and probably blissfully unaware of
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
what's exactly going on um so uh what
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do you uh with your
 
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
Indulgence today has just spent a few
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
minutes talking about our state health
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan which is something that
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
I can talk off rattle off off the top of
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
my head um as many of you know um first
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
of all you have a copy of uh the outline
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
of it in front of you um as many of you
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
know our state health assessment our
 
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
state health Improvement plan we
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
affectionally call those the Sha and the
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
ship um are developed every 5 to S years
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
they describe sort of a broad array of
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
the issues that impact um the health of
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire the purpose
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
we've had of of developing this plan is
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
to create a place where everyone um
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
lives through um a place where everyone
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
lives well through some coordinated
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
resources coordinated planning and
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
coordinated action across many different
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
sectors most importantly for you to know
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
this is not just the Department's plan
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
this really is a plan to help um all of
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
our partners across the state um towards
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
achieving some of our common goals the
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
Sha in the ship is built uh by a state
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
health Improvement plan advisory Council
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
that was established by legislation back
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
in 2020 it's RSA 126a
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
87 um and the council itself is made up
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
of a cast of thousands there are over 40
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
individuals that are on the council um
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
and it reflects Community Partners state
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
agencies legislators policy makers
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
really everyone who has any interest in
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of the State
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and that's important
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
for you to note as you skim through it
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
because there are things here that are
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
well out of the four corners of the
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:53.759 align:start position:0%
there are things in here that we don't
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily touch we certainly have some
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
interest in um and so it's important to
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
think of that that again this is not the
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
Department's plan but really is a
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
state's plan every state has a state
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
health Improvement plan to some degree
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
but what I am most proud of in this
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
particular document is that New
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has moved Beyond essentially
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
what has always been a list of top 10
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
things that kill you you know you would
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
get a plan and it would be tobacco
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
substance use you could sort of in fact
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
all of you could write it down off the
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
top of your head what you would
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
typically see um with the help of the
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
council that has been working on this we
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
really went beyond that and really tried
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
to look at in a much more holistic way
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
around four broad areas we looked at
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
access to opportunity community health
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
status and outcomes as well as social
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
connectedness and so the issues and the
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
goals and objectives again bigger than
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS um and you're going to see themes
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
in there that all of us talk about
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
regularly and where we often have broad
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
common ground even though there might be
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
different approaches to getting to the
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
same end so things around housing access
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
to good jobs making kids and families
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
have enough to eat you know in the
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
access to opportunity section the
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
council elevated ideas around Pro
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
removing barriers um limiting access to
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
Safe affordable disaster resilient
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
shelter I.E housing issues around
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and programs that promote
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
Financial Independence again making sure
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
people have access to good jobs in their
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
communities expanding efforts to improve
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
nutrition um again making sure kids and
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
families have things to eat we can get
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
there in a variety of different ways and
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
we have appreciated the legislator
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
legislative support in helping us over
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
the past few years in all of those areas
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
in the community section um you'll see
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
everything from addressing environmental
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
health concerns to ensuring we have
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities for every Community for
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning from Early Childhood
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
to adult learning earning we're looking
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
at again reducing exposure to
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
environmental contaminants everything
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
from past to lead exposure testing water
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
we all know that given the news we've
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
had right now about the importance of of
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
our environmental health risks in the
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um we've uh
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
elevated reducing Geographic barriers
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
that limit individuals abilities to
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
access preferred resources so again
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
that's around the built environment
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that we've got safe places
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
where you can travel you can bike you
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
can walk and that you have the
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
transportation that you need to get to
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
the places that you want to go um we're
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the support for supporting
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
caregivers and making sure that they are
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
connected within their community and
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
expanding programming for lifelong
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
learning and
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
enrichment um as we move to health
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
status and outcome section this is a
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more you know what has been
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
the um in the Wheelhouse of Public
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
Health in the past you'll see that we've
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
shair many of the goals that you have
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
had over um the past few sessions
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
including expanding access to Affordable
 
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
Care for dental services and Behavioral
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
Health you'll see a notice here to Clos
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
Loop referral we've all known that
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's been in the news and we're
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
thankful right now for this group's help
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
in helping us get to a final close loop
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
referral contract that was just passed
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
by governor and Council so it's a place
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
where both our outside Partners said
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is something that's really
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
important and we wanted to make sure
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
that we provided some thank you and some
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
gratit ude to you all for helping us get
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
there at the end of the day um also
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
items in the health um status are again
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
the pieces that you would expect around
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce we're going to hear some stuff
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
from Danielle today around Workforce
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to make sure that we have
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
access to a Continuum of Care for
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Resources um includ in
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
improving quality prenatal care labor
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
and delivery services and postpartum
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
care you're going to hear a little bit
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
later from um our folks in Maternal
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
Child Health around newbor screening all
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
of these things are connected so while I
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
can talk about these Health outcomes all
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
day long I will spare you of that um the
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
thing that I am most proud of in this
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
particular plan um was long before our
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
Surgeon General released his
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations on combating loneliness
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
and social isolation the Sha ship
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
Council um deeply understood that
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
loneliness and isolation is much more
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
than just a bad feeling that it really
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
Harms both individual um health and our
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
population's health and as the Surgeon
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
General also remarked after we published
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
ours um social isolation is associated
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
with a greater risk of things like
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease dementia stroke
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety and premature death
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
the mortality impact of being socially
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
disconnected is similar to smoking 15
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
cigarettes a day and even greater um
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
there are even greater associations than
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
with obese
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
and physical act inactivity the
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
consequences of a lack of social
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
connection fuels our substance misuse
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
issues in the state as well as our youth
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis so state government
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't always play the lead role in
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
addressing some of these issues um there
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
are things that communities faith-based
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
organizations others may need to take on
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
but I think we all have a unique role to
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
think to play when we think about
 
00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:29.310 align:start position:0%
think to play when we think about
strengthening

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
strengthening
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um systems for things like Aging in
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
place or supporting stronger connections
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
among young
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
families so if the department isn't the
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
lead on this great plan um for every
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
single thing what have we committed to
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
doing across public health and across
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
the department we have jointly begun
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
some intense planning along six main
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
areas one reducing heart disease it's
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
still the leading killer of the State of
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's not particularly sexy
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
we don't talk about it a lot but heart
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
disease is still a number one killer and
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
so we really need to be thinking in in
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
more um preventative ways to address um
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh creating opportunities so that we
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
have address premature death associated
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
with with heart disease we are looking
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
at improving the health of mothers for
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
during and after pregnancy again in many
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
of your committees you have heard us
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the opportunities that we
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
have to strengthen a system for labor
 
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
and delivery and prenatal care
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
especially given the challenges that we
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
have around Workforce in the state um we
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
would be remiss without talking about
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
improving youth mental health from
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
prevention to providing acute
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
residential care it's what we talk about
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
every day in the news in WMUR um it is
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
what guides much of our work these days
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
is around ensuring that we have a much
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
more robust system from Soup To Nuts for
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
youth Mental Health Services uh of
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
course the department has prioritized
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
addressing the harms of substance misuse
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
and and so that is not only you know our
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh our services from the doorways and
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we have that kind of
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
robust care involved but also ensuring
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we have preventative Services in
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
place so that we never get down that
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
path in the first place um it also means
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the other harms of
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
substance misuse which lead to premature
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
death which is of course not only
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
overdose important overdose but things
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
like infectious diseases or car or heart
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
disease that's related from um many
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
years of substance misuse so those are
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
things that our department is taking on
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
as as priorities uh decreasing the
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
spread of sexually transmitted diseases
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
I you know I don't think I get up I
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
can't get away without saying things
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
like chlamydia um you know in front of
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
you at some point or another but that's
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
something that we're continuing to dress
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
within the department and then finally
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
reducing um exposure to environmental
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
hazards we've all heard the impact right
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
now of Pas we know that our partners at
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
are working closely around pasas and
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
Water Supplies we're working hand inand
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
with them um and then down to the
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
everyday environmental hazards that we
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
continue to Ste struggle with of things
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
like lead exposure among children those
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
are things that are really important to
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
us we're really promoting issues around
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
water testing um and ensuring that
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
kiddos have the appropriate screening at
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
ages one and two so we do not have a
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
specific ask of you today but we want we
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to provide this to you

to help to ask you to consider as you
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
wrap up this current session as we think
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
and as we think about the next bium how
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
can we ensure that communities have the
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
resources and the policies to address
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
these priorities we also again wanted to
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the help that you have
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
given us and the guidance you have given
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
us in order to advance many of these
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
activities I think we are on the same
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
page in many of these areas you know
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
from issues such as the expansion of
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid postpartum adult Dental
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
Investments that the that the
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
legislature has made in housing around
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health substance misuse the
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
with policym regarding past to to lead
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
poisoning um there are all number of
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
ways that smart policies Investments
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
strengthen our states um and help our
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
residents have some better opportunities
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
we know that money is going to get tight
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
in the next bium um and I think all
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to think very
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
strategically about where we continue to
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
support policies and Investments so that
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
we can make progress on these broad
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
areas of Health Improvement so that's
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%

ideas and we are um very committed to
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
digging in especially in those six areas
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned in improving um the
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
work through the department so thank you
 
00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:06.830 align:start position:0%
work through the department so thank you
any

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions Senator Rosenwald welcome back
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
I have two two separate questions if I
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
could could you catch us up on closed
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
loop because the last I knew the
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
executive Council had tabled the
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
contract it was passed at the last um
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
executive Council okay so they took it
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
off yep they took it off the table and
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
pass okay and secondly
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
um there's a proposal in nashwa to build
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
an asphalt plant in the middle of a
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
lowincome neighborhood of Housing and
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
Dees is in the process of evaluating the
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
application for permit their regulations
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
require them
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
to um look at the public health statutes
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
and do doing that but when I asked them
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
if they were considering things like
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
asthma rates and children they kind of
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
looked at me like I they didn't know
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
what I was talking about so my question
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
DHS speaking to
 
00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:19.870 align:start position:0%
DHS speaking to
Dees

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
Dees
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
about this application or are they just
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
working by themselves so we have a very
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
close relationship one of the benefits
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
of Public Health sitting over at Hazen
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
drive as we're physically in the same
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
building as Dees so we have a great
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
relationship with them I don't know the
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
details on that particular proposal but
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
I can go back and check in um you know
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott has been a a great
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
partner to us and has always welcomed uh
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
public Health's participation in some of
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
those processes they have their own um
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know the uh policies that they
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
follow but they're always have welcomed
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
us to participate that would be great
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
because they are citing the Public
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
Health statutes great thank you thank
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you know I
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
can't help but notice with your health
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan access to Opportunities
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
social connectedness Community Etc which
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
is great my my question is do you have
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
the or are the community health you know
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
workers part of your plan going forward
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
because obviously they're relatively new
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
but they're becoming increas inly
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
apparent to us that they may be part of
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
the the fabric of Healthcare in its
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
delivery and the social determinant of
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
Health Etc in the community so are they
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
part of your plan absolutely so thank
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
you so chws are community health workers
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
are incredibly important um member of
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
sort of the team of Health Care
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
Providers or other you know individuals
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
within our community that can address
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
some of those social determinant needs
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
can really develop relationships with
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
families who are in need and get them
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
connected to the right services and so
 
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
we've thought about them a lot in this
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
plan and they're when you think about
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
things like social connectedness they're
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
really sort of the the key people to
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that um folks that you know
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
and trust in your community can connect
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
you to the resources that you may need
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
um we've been thankful that there's been
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
some work this session around chws and
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
we thank you for the through Workforce
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
um bill um and we have also been able to
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
use some federal resources to ensure
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we can continue funding at least
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
for the short term um community health
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
workers in our Family Resource Centers
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
in our federally qualified Health
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
Centers and in our local Health
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
Department so absolutely um I am a huge
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
fan in fact I will be speaking at the
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
community health worker um conference
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
that is occurring next week to which
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
come representative Merchant thank you
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can you follow up on the
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
community health worker in regard The
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate in regards to certification the
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
need for it um because um we recently
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
had a bill in the house and I sort of
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
misunderstood it so could you provide
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
some clarification on the certification
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
what it does from not just the U
 
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
person's competency but what it does
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
financially as far as being able to
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
build for it sure I I could um Henry
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
could probably speak even a little bit
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
better to this but so currently we don't
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
have a system for certification for
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
community health workers in the state
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
and so we have had to pay for them
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
through things like grant funding
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
because we've not without that level of
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
certification we're not able to Bill
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um so we have a couple of
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
different ways uh opportunities to
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
explore how we could or could not do
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
that moving forward um how we could
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
partner with the office of professional
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
lure and certification um and there are
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
a number of different ways that other
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
states have thread this needle and so
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the next year or so to
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what's the best way for New
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you representative
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%

together uh on page five um talking
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
about where can we begin to address
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
inequity in New
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it talks about Sullivan
 
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
County um and how more than 30% of their
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
monthly income on housing is spent and
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
it's above the state average I'm
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
surprised that's is that the only County
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that that's through up
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
because I would think a lot of the
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
Southern counties that would even more
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
so a problem I think this is a an
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
artifact of the lower incomes in
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and the higher housing
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
costs so you sort of put those two
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
things together and you end up spending
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
a larger proportion of your salary so
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
places like hillsbor and Rockingham
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
while the housing costs are astronomical
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
um sometimes there's a little bit of a
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
income bump that you might get in those
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
communities That You Don't See in places
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
like Claremont or Newport and certainly
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant could speak
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
did I have a followup followup so so it
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
is unique it is a unique situation
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
particularly the Sullivan County and and
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
again you know you could look at a place
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
like coos coos is hasn't had the same
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
housing cost rate even though their
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
salaries are a bit more depressed than
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state their housing
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
costs haven't quite gone up as High um
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
this data is a little bit old and we put
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
this together in our state health
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
assessment when in 20122 you know we can
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
look at that data again moving forward
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
but at the point in time um Sullivan
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
really jumped off the page thank
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
you on page one on the far left thank
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
you so much for that about uh First
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
Nations peoples but I notice when I look
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
at the left column on pages five six and
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
seven while blacks are mentioned
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hispanics are mentioned uh various
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
counties and so on there's nothing about
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
this population I'd like to see more I
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
think I think that's great we would as
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
well um one of the statistical problems
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
we have is the relative small number of
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
American Indians that are in New
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are um in the data sets
 
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
that we have that are identified as
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
American Indian so sometimes we have to
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
aggregate years of data and so it makes
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
it hard and masks some of those
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
disparities that we certainly know exist
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the rest of the
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
country could you give a guess as to how
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
many individuals I I could not give that
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I am sorry and
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
then were you to
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
try um people
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
marry other people yes and so one might
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
claim oh sure I am
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
oneir and so it counts but it's
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
different from two3 yes I'd like to see
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
data coming forward when you can yes we
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
we would as well of course not having a
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
federally recognized tribe in New
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um make some of that difficult
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
as all we're one of the only states that
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
does not have a federally recognized
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
tribe um again makes it complicated with
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
our data sources where we can accurately
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
capture um as with most uh data sources
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
people self-identify so if someone says
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
they are we have no reason to believe
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
that they are not whatever it is they
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
say they identify as so perhaps for
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
statistics purposes the fact there is no
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
federally recognized tribe is not that
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
important because an individual can
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
claim a membership even if the feds
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't recognize it correct but we also
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a population Center you know
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
um a federally recognized tribe or a
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
place where um that you would have a
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
larger proportion of folks who identify
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
as American Indian living or indigenous
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
populations okay all very complicated
 
00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
that doesn't dis um the what it still
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
supports however is we know that
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
American Indians have far worse Health
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
outcomes than many other groups sure
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah any other questions
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
chair going back to Senator Rosen
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
talking talking about the issue in
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
nashwa in public health we have
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
something comparable to that in
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
Claremont they're trying to use a
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
transfer station to make it into a um
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
dumping station quite frankly so how can
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
I work with the Department on the public
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
health issue as well as working with
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
Dees because that location is within
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
1,000 ft from a elementary school along
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
with the residential um and we have deep
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
concerns of what it's going to do from a
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
public health point of view but we don't
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
know exactly where to go sure so I would
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
encourage you to reach out to us reach
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
out to me directly and I can connect us
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
with um the right folks over at Dees
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
we're we do a really nice job of working
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
in Partnership we do not have public
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
health authority um you they would have
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
the authority in that space But as I've
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
said they've really welcomed our
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
feedback as they um go through their
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
policies and processes for
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
Weber as of the 2020 census
 
00:34:00.679 --> 00:34:03.269 align:start position:0%
Weber as of the 2020 census
um

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
one um sorry 1.1% of the New Hampshire
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
population self-identified as American
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
Indian and Alaskan native alone
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
1.1% and there is a category of two or
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
more races which is 10.2 but it doesn't
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
say what the mix
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
is thank you you thank
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
you anyone else
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
you and the chair
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
Lipman good morning thank you for the
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
chance to share a few things um the the
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
first item um I'd like to share is the
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
report that's statutorily required from
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
hb2 with respect to um a couple of
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
components of what the department was
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
asked to do in that legislation um one
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
was to um and whates it look like
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
because we got a stack of it's a it's a
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
one one page two-sided with yellow on
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
the back with yellow on the back got it
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
yellow is actually the punchline I think
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
if um I I promise not to read ahead of
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
you that's okay so um we were asked to
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
apply for a a plan amendment to add
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
postpartum coverage which meant going
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
from 60 days to to a year um and we were
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
among you know most every state has
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
subsequently adopted that um aspect and
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to do it by uh a date
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
in August which we met that deadline um
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
we stood it up on October 1st and
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
um the uh the number of women that have
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
been able to take advantage of it and
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
the period from October 1 till um the
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
end of March were 137 women um I need to
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh sort of go back and and compare that
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
to what we expected but I think it's
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's on the lower end of our our
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
expectations that being said you know I
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
still think it's kind of early um that
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know we'll we'll continue to see
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
that that grow um and then our goal is
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
to start to add some metrics once we
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
have some credibility and experience um
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
but I this was the first metric I could
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
bring to you and intend to to bring more
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the um the second the SEC
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me the third paragraph on the
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
second page um had to um look at what we
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
were doing in terms of the expanding the
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
access to the really going back to the
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
future back to what was um in place
 
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.309 align:start position:0%
future back to what was um in place
before

00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
2011 you know we've made the rule
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
changes and such to to do that I need to
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
collect some utilization data on that to
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
to give you some sense of that and I
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
think in the next report I'll be able to
 
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.670 align:start position:0%
think in the next report I'll be able to
do

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm recalling a news report
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
recently about our birth rate having
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
declined to its lowest level in
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
In Living memory or maybe any memory um
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
and is the are the lower numbers in line
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
with that or would you know so actually
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
or are they even lower than you would
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
have expected giving a declining birth
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
rate my my recollection in in for the 22
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
data um is actually that New Hampshire
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
was one of the only states that showed
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
an increase in the the birth rate okay
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
so maybe that was a national story and I
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I'm sorry and so I I don't
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
really have a a feel for this year but
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that at least in the
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid side I'm seeing fairly stable
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and we have done things to try to
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
support um hospitals being able to and
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
doctors part of hb2 um was uh allowed us
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
to uh Target a rate increase for um
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
people who deliver babies U also the the
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
freestanding birthing centers and the
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
prior year we had increased the uh
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to hospitals for doing
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
births um I think it was 34% for the
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
small hospitals and 24% for the for the
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
larger hospitals to you know try to
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
stabilize um what's going on in terms of
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
the subsidy that Medicaid May um May do
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
um the not to sort of weigh into sort of
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
the bills that are currently active but
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
one one bill of concern to me as the
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director is the one that deals
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
with loss of consortion which I know
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
isn't in front of this committee but the
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
concern is that particularly for um
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
obstetrical Services the malpractice
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
Market has hardened and particularly for
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
nurse midwives and you know concerned
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
about um you know if if there's an
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
impact on if that legislation were to
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
pass what's the impact on on
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
um rates and in terms of you know does
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
that have some unintended consequence at
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
least on the access
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
side Senator
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald thank you
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
so Henry are are these
 
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.470 align:start position:0%
so Henry are are these
137

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
137
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
people were they eligible because they
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
were not eligible for Medicaid expansion
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
but were eligible under that
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
250% of poverty I think it is for the
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
pregnant women yes and might some of
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
them have become eligible for for
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in a different way let's say
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
expansion and so there maybe actually
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
more than 137 women right I I think
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
you're hitting on a point you know it's
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to predict this in
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
terms of where people land on
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility is affected by a lot of
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
factors and you know with the economy um
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
with wages going up in different things
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
that people may land or land in
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
different categories or they you know
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing in Medicaid expansion
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
as an example it hasn't come down as
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
much as we thought it would it's come
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
down a lot from like almost 97,000 to
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
59,000 but um I think that it just may
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
be the and I'll have to look into it
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
more I think it's a fair question in
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
terms of you know where people are
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
landing when they give uh birth and are
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
they getting the 12 months of coverage
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
um so I I think there's more to more to
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
look into there and I I just didn't
 
00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
enough time to do more than this for
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
this month's report thank you any
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
Lipman none for the moment but we may
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
bring you back at the end if I do have
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
two more reports to uh well thank you
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
for what you've done and please go on to
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the next two sure and um Dr Finny also
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
has a report to to to share on that give
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
you a dental update good you know we're
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
actually celebrated the one-year
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
anniversary of dental uh you know the
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of uh April April 1st marked
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh starting our second year um hard to
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
believe um the the report I wanted to go
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
over is this one um the bright
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
orange and um just wanted to share um
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
going to jump to slide three and there
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
there are slide numbers on these this
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
month um on the bottom right hand side
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
just want to give you some comparative
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
information that was compiled by CMS um
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of New Hampshire compared to
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
other New England states on the unwind
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
and and the United States and I'd like
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
to point out a couple statistics here
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
for you um probably four to the to the
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
right is the percent renewed on an expar
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
basis meaning that the department had
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
enough information to not require the
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
person to fill out a new application
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
particularly um and uh what we're seeing
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
there is that you know we seen a
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
significant Improvement in this area in
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to renew um we had
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
the fourth highest uh expart rate in the
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
nation you know we began in the the the
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
unwind um we were under 20% in our first
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
number of months it it does depend on
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
the type of population that you're
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
you're also un unwinding or reconsider
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
reconsidering so we've made a lot of
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
progress there in helping people um who
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible maintain um
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
coverage the other thing on the far
 
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
far right would be um the um the percent
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
pending at the end of the month
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
basically you know we hear a lot of
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
things about how New Hampshire sometimes
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
the eligibility processing isn't as fast
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
as we like but in terms of backlog
 
00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
compared to other states I think um you
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
know while we have areas to improve I'm
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
not going to say that we don't um but
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know on a relative basis um you know
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
we're we were second in New England and
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
and you know well below the the national
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
average and
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
um also uh and the month that we're
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
looking at that page three is January
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
which is the latest published
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
information and then the percent that
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
loss coverage is uh going back towards
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
the left is um the
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh there's a column called number
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
terminated from Medicaid and the percent
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
terminated you know we had 518
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
individuals out of
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
8,924 that uh didn't maintain coverage
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
which was almost a 91% renewal rate
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
um and again you know in terms of where
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
we are in the unwine we're at the the
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
part of the unwine where we're dealing
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
with CFI and nursing home which we
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
expected would be much higher
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
retention um and um the the next page
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
page four is just um the month of
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
December a preceding month just for
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
comparison so I feel like um again again
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's always room to improve
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
but we we're doing a pretty good job um
 
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.790 align:start position:0%
but we we're doing a pretty good job um
comparatively

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
comparatively
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
um on uh Slide Five is the EXP parte
 
00:44:41.069 --> 00:44:41.079 align:start position:0%
renewal rates and there you can see you
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
when we started the unwind um Again part
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
based on the population we're unwinding
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
we had a low of 18% and um we hit a high
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
of 81% in um the first quarter of of uh
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
of uh 20 3 uh Federal fiscal year I
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
guess that would be um and you know saw
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
you know an increase from 76 to 81 to 79
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's when we're hitting the most
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations and again you
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
know typically once you're in a nursing
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
home and under Medicaid or in um CFI or
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
other waiver populations you're you're
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
going to see people not churn as
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
much um the next page six and seven are
 
00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.430 align:start position:0%
much um the next page six and seven are
are

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
um kind of the the enrollment numbers um
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
the page six at the top gives you the
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
statistic as of the basically the end of
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
March which is the onee mark right we we
 
00:45:42.599 --> 00:45:43.630 align:start position:0%
March which is the onee mark right we we
had

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
182,780 people enrolled in total in the
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
program you know that's down from a high
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
of 251,000 plus individuals but at the
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
bottom you can see if you look at the
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
last line on the page the grand total um
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know the week that things sort of
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
shut down during the public health
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
emergency we were at 177 420 um at the
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
end of uh end of March we were at 182
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
753 um and um what we see in the next
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
slide just during during the month we
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
see very we see uh fluctuations
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
typically in the middle of the month
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
we'll see a higher number of individuals
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
so as of the 22nd we had
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
184,000 people enrolled in the program
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
but again when we finish going through
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
renewal activity it'll probably come
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
closer to
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
183,000 um will be probably where we
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
likely will end um the month of April um
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
the next page page eight is I think
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
something I wanted to I think is
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
probably the most valuable these next
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
slides the slides that I've covered
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
about what's going on in enrollment um
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
on November 6 was the low Point um in
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
the unwind in terms of enrollment and
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
you can see you know a couple of groups
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
that we've been worried about um the
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
purple line I know it may not be
 
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly easy to see but the purple
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
line and the yellow line are children
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that um increase by you
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
know almost a little over three 3,000
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
children have come um onto the Medicaid
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
Program um you know there was a concern
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
you know highlighted as being a state
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
that lost a lot of children that part of
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
it is we've seen I think in last time I
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
presented to you we've had family income
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a higher proportion of our our
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
families be in the 300 and 400% we only
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
go up to
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
323 um which is uh among the highest
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
meaning the most favorable eligibility
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities we've seen School
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment go down but um what I think
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
we're seeing play out here is the
 
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage children are now
 
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
given um 12 months of continuous
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
coverage that was a requirement not just
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but across the
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
country um also in the
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
um the other categories not so much big
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid expansion has seen an
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
increase as well um from from the low
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
point but again we're down from almost
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
97,000 individuals what I I think is
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
going on a little bit there we need to
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
do a little bit more research is a lot
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
of people looking to that eligibility
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
group when they're waiting for other
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
determinations other benefits to come
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
into play like if they're they're
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
waiting for disability determination or
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
or or other things this is a way they
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
can get coverage until U maybe a waiver
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
is is considered but um you know in
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the entire program the the mix
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
has shift a little bit towards more
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
towards Medica Aid uh expansion the
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Program which you know
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
has the higher Federal match
 
00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
but I think this is this is a graph I
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
think I get a lot of information out of
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
um and then um Pages uh page nine um is
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
really our detailed report that we we
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
look at in terms of on a monthly basis
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of closures and here we're
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking at both people who are protected
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
in the continuous coverage as well as
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who are just regular
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
renewals and as as uh is sort of
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
supported by the expart rate we had
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
91.6% of the the regular renewals retain
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
coverage um and 91.6 excuse me 88.5% of
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
the the protected population you can see
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
protected population is down to the very
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
little there was only 29 protected
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
people that went through and we expect
 
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
to have run through all the protected
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
people um by the month of May um and we
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
we did slow down with the the most most
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and I'm glad we did based on
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges we're seeing and
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
I I'll get to that a little bit more in
 
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
I I'll get to that a little bit more in
a

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
moment um page 10 is just uh totals up
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
all the activity by every month
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
um page 11 and 12 are
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
um focusing on an area that I haven't
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
reported on before um and this is a
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
dashboard that we're looking to further
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
develop but this is a month by month
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
look the the waiver population was given
 
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
additional protections um in terms of
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
the medical evaluation assessment that
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
has to be done on an annual basis um
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
people did not have to complete this
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
during the The Continuous coverage
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
period so there's some people that have
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
not had that checked for almost four
 
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
years and um so we're going through the
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
that that process here the the yellow
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
highlight is the number of meas that
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at you can it's not until
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
page 12 where you see um um in the month
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
of uh March uh and looking at February
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
where we start to see some closures
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
around um you know we've had 66 closures
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
on on almost 1,200 um medical
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations but we've been the
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
Department's been using a number of
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
different strategies to try to
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
um get these evaluations done give
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
people an opportunity to appeal we've um
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
we've asked CMS to extend from 15 days
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
to 30 days um the opportunity to appeal
 
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
and maintain coverage because I think po
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
the populations in this group um you
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
know are maybe have a a lower capacity
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
to respond quickly and so trying to give
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
them more time we're waiting for that
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
approval we did also ask for another
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
temporary authority to on the
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
um the income verification side of um in
 
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
nurs people in nursing facilities are
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
allowed up to $2,500 of uh of Assets in
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
terms of asset verification is to try to
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
move things along a little bit faster as
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
if if everything else lines up and they
 
00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
have you know $2,500 or less in assets
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
we're not required to to verify that
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
$2500 which helps move things along a
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
faster um we we'll probably have more to
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
say about some some other things that
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this place this is you
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
know the population we're most concerned
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
about the people that are home alone and
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know depend on their services that
 
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
you know depend on their services that
they

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.309 align:start position:0%
they
get

00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
um then just pull a a couple of slides
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
that really um show go back to sort of
 
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
financial eligibility and um the the
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
darkest color there on page 13 um was
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
the month of March and you can see that
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
here just there were 342 individuals
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we processed in the home the CFI
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
basis on at least on a financial
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility basis um all but five U made
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
it through the financial um uh
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint and that um the ability you
 
00:53:16.589 --> 00:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
know of the ones that were um more than
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of them ended up being able
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
to be expart review which is sort of the
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
bottom right hand
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
corner um you know there were um on the
 
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
left hand corner there's a little chart
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the five people
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
um one was for income was one was failed
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
to do the redetermination and three may
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
have been for other reasons such as they
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
moved or um that they uh there other
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
change in circumstance change in
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
household composition that that thing
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
things like that and then um the next
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
page uh 14 is just looking at those
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
numbers on a percentage
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
basis um then on page 15 is looking at
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
at the nursing facilities here here on
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
the top left there were 278 individuals
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
in the month of March all but four made
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
it through the financial redetermination
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
process um again a um on the bottom
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
right a high level of passive expart
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
renewal um and then on the bottom left
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
there's one person on income and three
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
for other reasons
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and then page 16 is um just the
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
percentages for those same numbers um
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
page 17 um is uh sort of where uh CFI
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
elig eligibles are um the CFI case
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
manager asked us to sort of lift this up
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit more you know we have um
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
seen a decline in the CFI um
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
population we do want to see that go in
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
the opposite direction because when you
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
compare the cost to the state to keep
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
people in their homes versus an
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
institution in most cases it's
 
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.870 align:start position:0%
institution in most cases it's
considerably

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
considerably
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
less um as you may also remember um the
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
system of care that was included um in I
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
believe hb2 as well the department was
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
asked to um apply for a waiver to
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
implement presumptive eligibility
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
for the CFI
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
population um again there we met our
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
deadline in terms of submitting as part
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
of our 1115 waiver to include that um
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
all indications are right now that we
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
expect that we'll get that approval um
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
by the end of June it will take us a
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
little time to stand it up uh system
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
wise but that's going to help I think
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
there um and I think you know we you
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
know I think we have every reason to
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
want the CFI population relative to
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
other populations to
 
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
other populations to
increase

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
um think any questions you have on this
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
chair as always Mr Libman I want to say
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
your due diligence the work that you put
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
into it we state benefits tremendously
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
from it and I want to say publicly the
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you in regards to the CFI is there
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to some sort of
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
comparison to the waivers that are
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully growing compared to nursing
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
home um at least the County nursing
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
homes because if I understand it correct
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
financially it's better probably for the
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
state financially as well as well as for
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
the patient psychologically and
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise to probably age in place is
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
there any kind of comparative numbers
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
looking at nursing home occupancy versus
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
the use of cfis
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
yes I I think I don't have I think
 
00:57:02.029 --> 00:57:02.039 align:start position:0%
that's probably a good thing to maybe
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
have a longer discussion and prepare
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
some information for you but you know I
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
think the department would say is that
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
you know as we compare to other states
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
our Reliance on
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
institutionalization versus um home um
 
00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
the the hp2 rate increases um we had um
 
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
way point I believe came in and met with
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
a department talking about what a big
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
difference that's made in terms of
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
they're able to increase the the number
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
of people they're serving and the number
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
of hours so I think part of our
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
CFI problem has been the rate side of it
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
that it's was hard to hire workers to to
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
to do the in home care um but I know
 
00:57:44.319 --> 00:57:45.589 align:start position:0%
to do the in home care um but I know
that

00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
um they were they took the initiative to
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
come and talk to us uh appreciation for
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
what was done by the legislature to
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
improve those those kind of rates I
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
think you know sometimes we can be um
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's worth making the investment in the
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know the Home Care side um more than
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
we than we have I think it's seems like
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're spending more money in the long
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
we're follow up follow up no thank you
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
no Senator
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
rosenal you thank you Henry I love data
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
great um I have two questions on
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
slide six I think it
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
is maybe it's seven six or seven yes um
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're showing a
 
00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:45.559 align:start position:0%
decrease versus prepandemic
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
among individuals with
 
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.750 align:start position:0%
among individuals with
disabilities

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
and um that's concerning to me could you
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
talk more about
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
why why those three distinct
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
populations have a lower case load yeah
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the children's with disabilities is
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
one we did a little research into and
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
part of that is um you know children who
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
were children during the start of the
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage have moved out of
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
the children's category into to other
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
categories in other words um in terms of
 
00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:35.039 align:start position:0%
the adults with disabilities um you know
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
I I don't I need to do a little bit more
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
on on that and some some analytics we've
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
been focusing on mental health and
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
children um in terms of trying to better
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on there but I
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
think that you know in terms of what I
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
get for like phone calls um to to help
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
people on there's been very little in
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
the waiver areas rather than in
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
CFI that that I've taken phone calls on
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
and you know try to help people but um I
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
can try to get a little bit more
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
information for you there um I think the
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
other thing that we're also seeing is um
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
potentially some lag in catching up with
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
um some determinations in the disability
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
um um unit in ter because we've had a
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
change in contractor in terms of doing
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
some of that work but I'd like to come
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
back to you with something more specific
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
than that that would be that would be
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
great um on different topic um with the
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
CFI um with the rate
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
increases I know we can't
 
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
increases I know we can't
require

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
the agencies to pass
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
through the money but what kind of
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
reporting has the department gotten from
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
the organiz ations that get their CFI
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
contracts in terms of how much they've
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
been able to increase compensation for
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
the direct service
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
providers um have two- part answer the
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
first part actually is uh in regulations
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
that were published on Monday CMS is
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
implementing an 80% requirement of the
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
rate to go um and I don't I have to look
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
more into the regulation in terms of the
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
timing of that
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
I I do know um anecdotally like Waypoint
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
gave us some statistics on how much
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
they've improved salaries and um trying
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
um name's escaping me for the moment but
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
they an in home they gave like a $5
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
raise to their staff um and they
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
actually because of the also the the
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
spending plan money that was available
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
through arpa they actually in
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
anticipation actually were early in
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
terms of implementing their their salary
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
increases um but um we do get some
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
reporting on that I don't get that
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
directly but um the department does and
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
I can bring that one back too for um
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
some followup um part of their spending
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
plan is yeah
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
yep representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
chair uh in regards to the CFI waiver
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
is there some numbers that look at how
 
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.829 align:start position:0%
is there some numbers that look at how
much

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
we provide to the agency per waiver
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
compared to the cost to be per day
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
inside of a nursing home yes there is
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
and I wish I could remember today what
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
what the exact numbers are but we as
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
part of our our waiver proposal we we
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
sort of um put that out I think the
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
savings is
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
probably rather than just guess here I
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
think it it's it's a pretty significant
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh savings over and someone here
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
remembers that number um but that's okay
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
M just thank you back to you on that
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
one um representative McDonald thank you
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Mr Litman um
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
on page uh nine um and I I think I've
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
touched on this before but a different I
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
thought hopefully it's a different
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
question than before uh total closure by
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
reasons fail to read is number two fail
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
to redetermined
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
I know when I was in the department a
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
case worker and this might not be a
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
question for you but a case worker had
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
some discretion if someone was elderly
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
in a nursing home for example that
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
tended to be an annual readed because
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
their circumstances weren't likely to
 
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
change but a younger person working or
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
possibly changing jobs having another
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
child they were on like a six-month
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
cycle or maybe even less depending on um
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
you know different time frames and and
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
factors do you know if that's still the
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
case so we have
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
um again in part for the first round of
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
redeterminations we put the the nursing
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
homes and the facilities towards the
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
back because we knew that there's more
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
that people had to get ready for to get
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
through that process like they have to
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
get bank statement and life insurance
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
policy values sometimes and things like
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we also um it added 30 days on to
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
the time that they had to usually it was
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
30 days they have to responded we used
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
the temporary authority to increase that
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
to 60 days so that people had more time
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
to to react to that in the waiver um
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
populations um in the CFI area they were
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
also using um a concept called bridging
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
to try to give people more time to to
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
respond or to get things done um it'll
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see um how these
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
author ities they're they run through
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
the end of uh
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
2024 um what What U what the impact of
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
when some of that is backed off but I
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
think we've learned a lot by going
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
through this and um we do a lot more in
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
terms of noticing an Outreach than than
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
probably the time you were in the
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
department even the time since I began
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
in the department
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
that you know we we've used the color
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
letters you know the pink letter to let
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
give people um heads up the yellow
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
letter to warn them and then if they
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
close we use a blue letter to say it's
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
if it's blue it's not too late to renew
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
um we're sharing lists with um with the
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities um we're we're
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
looking at other options for um trying
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
to to provide information that for those
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
people are being paid that want to make
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
sure that the people who can be eligible
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
get eligible like um working with
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
different with different groups and um
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create more transparency
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
so that that the the organizations can
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
help themselves and helping the person
 
01:06:08.029 --> 01:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
and uh some of those things are still
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
works in progress but I think we're
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
doing a lot more to try to help people
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
stay covered okay follow followup so is
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
there an average redetermination period
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
like is it if not six months is it like
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
eight or nine or so so we're in terms of
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
someone is required to be annually
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
redetermined under normal circumstances
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
or if there's a change in circumstances
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
um there's also if if someone is also
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
receiving snap and and Medicaid benefits
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
they can be redetermined on a six-month
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
basis if if it's to their benefit and
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
you no further questions I did want to
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
um if I could Mr chairman um there was a
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
question about the certification of uh
 
01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
community health workers is when we talk
 
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
certification um under Medicaid we're
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
really talking about someone who is um
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law um credentialed
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
through licensed or certified through
 
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:09.799 align:start position:0%
oplc um and that's what level they need

used to want stickers in my previous
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
committee but that's another
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
story well good morning and and thank
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
you for um allowing me a few minutes to

just bring you up to speed on adult
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
Dental uh we were very excited to
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
celebrate our first anniversary on April
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
1st I can't believe that a year has
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
passed already um and I just want to
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
extend my thanks once again
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
um for all of the support and interest
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the adult Dental benefit we wouldn't
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
be here without uh legislative support
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
you um the first part of um our report
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
has to do with service utilization and
 
01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.470 align:start position:0%
has to do with service utilization and
program

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
Administration I think you can see that
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
from implementation in April of 23
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
coming up to March of
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
24 um we've had a steady increase in the
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
number of unique members being served
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
every month and the number of claims
 
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.030 align:start position:0%
every month and the number of claims
being

01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
submitted um you know with a few little
 
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
waverings uh December and January were a
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
little bit dicey there were some weather
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
issues and then holidays so that is not
 
01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.189 align:start position:0%
issues and then holidays so that is not
an

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
unexpected um drop in those numbers but
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
you can see that February and March came
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
back um very strong so um these claim
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
totals were produced the first or second
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
week of April and we were just short of
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
35 00 claims and slightly greater than
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
2500 unique members served um in the
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
month of March
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
2024 um and you know we uh have served
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
over 12,000 unique members to this point
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
and I would say that that number also um
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
is increasing on a monthly
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
basis um the next page gets into our our
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
Network dashboard which is hot off the
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
press uh two days ago we're now up to
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
165 providers that includes um oral
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
surgeons we also were very happy uh to
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
add a pred onist in the last couple of
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
months and in ongoing efforts of
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta and DentaQuest they have
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
had over 60 office recruitment visits
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
since January 1st and those recruitment
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
visits include not only reaching out to
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
dentists who are not yet enrolled in the
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
program but coming back around to the
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
folks that enrolled early um in the
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
spring last year and checking in with
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
them to see how things are going how is
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit working for you how is it
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
working for the members that they serve
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
um and what has their experience been
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
and also most importantly if they're at
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
a point where they could potentially um
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
take on a greater load of members so you
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
know those efforts are ongoing
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
um when you look at the county breakdown
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
chesher is the the county with the least
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
providers at this point um when we move
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
to the next page and start talking about
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
mobile services you will see that uh we
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
are in the throws of getting that first
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
date nailed down for chesher to do a
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
mobile clinic um and then the the two
 
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
areas uh Sullivan and Carol County have
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
yellow arrows and those are now in
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
regular rotation with the mobile
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
services and in particular in Sullivan
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
County we're working on an additional
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
location um so that we can increase the
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
footprint there and this planning I will
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
tell you is is
 
01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.990 align:start position:0%
tell you is is
ongoing

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
um the you know when you look at the
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
schedule today that I present to you for
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
mobile services it's much more robust
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
than 3 months ago or four months ago and
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
to that end and on April 11th we met
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
with Northeast Delta and DentaQuest and
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
solve who actually does um the mobile
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
services to really strategize what does
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
the mobile service portion of this um
 
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
Network look like for the longer term
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
initially we thought that that was going
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
to be um a temporary measure and we
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
realize now that just because of
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues and um shortage areas
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
for providers we're going to have to
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
keep using the mobile services and
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
really have them become uh a stable
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
portion of our Network where um our
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
visits and then um in terms of
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement um I do want you
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
to know that probably the only meetings
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
that we have curtailed at this point are
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
those for the technical implement ation
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
because at this point we have all our
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
systems in place that uh move the data
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
back and forth between the state and the
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
two um Dental
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
organizations um Northeast Delta and
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
dest uh but all of our other meetings
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
are still going Full Tilt um just as
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
they were a year ago we are not sitting
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
back and saying okay you know you have
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
the program this is it we realize there
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
are areas that we need to strengthen um
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
so the um New Hampshire oral health
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
Coalition has been key in our activities
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh they very graciously held the
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
birthday party for legislators that was
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
held on March 28th and I hope that some
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
of you were able to be there and have
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
some birthday cake um again that was to
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
show our thanks uh for your support and
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
and the work that everyone did to get us
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
to the point of finally launching this
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
benefit the the Coalition is also host
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
ho hosting a summit on May 9th which
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
basically will be an opportunity for
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and public members to come
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
in and talk about what happened over the
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
last few years that led up to the
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
benefit how the first year has gone and
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
then to have some open discussion about
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh what do the next few years look like
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
with the benefit um it's very important
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
to us that we have input from the public
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh we need to know um where things are
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
working well where we have areas that we
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
need to work um and so I have to say
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
that Northeast Delta Dental as well as
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
dest have been uh very good partners in
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
this Venture and they are committed to
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that we develop all of the
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the parts of the benefit that we need so
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
that we can serve all of the
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
members so I don't know if you have any
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%

on loan forgiveness to Current Dental
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
students who will make a commitment and
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
to relatively new dentists are out in
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
the field who would like to make a
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
commitment for loan
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
forgiveness there are actually two
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
programs there is the state loan
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
repayment program and we actively are
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
you know advertising the fact that that
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
Loan program is available uh messaging
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
goes up on the state's social media
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
sites from time to time um we I share
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
that information with the dental Society
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
to to put out um I also include that
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
information for the offices that I have
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
to survey for the children's benefit and
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
now I'm happy to add that the uh
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
Northeast Delta Dental has made a very
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
sizable um commitment to loan
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
repayment um over the tri-state area
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
they serve Maine Vermont and New
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I have been able to sit
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
on a steering committee for that loan
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
repayment program uh to help guide them
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
because like the state program there is
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
a requirement for the individuals to
 
01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
treat Medicaid members so um we actually
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
are having a meeting June 3 uh where we
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
will bring together folks from Northeast
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
Delta as well as the state to talk about
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
where we are right now today with both
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
loan repayment programs and what does
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
the future look for that um for us to
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
work together to make sure that um
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
dentists are recruited to the state and
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
are aware that those two um programs are
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
available at some point could you send
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
me a onepage or maybe send it to the
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
whole committee and anyone who wishes to
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
look at it will have an opportunity to
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%

this is specific to New Hampshire the

panel based on the following
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
criteria the disorder is well defined
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
with a known incidence the disorder is
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
associated with significant morbidity or
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
mortality the disorder can be detected
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
with a screening test that is ethical
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
safe accurate and cost effective
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
effective treatment exists for the
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
disorder and that early treatment
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
meaning before the onset of symptoms is
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
more effective in improving Health
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes than
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
later the program is also responsible
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
for ensuring that screening is done in a
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
timely manner and any presumptive
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
positive or out-of-range result is
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
reported to a provider the goal of
 
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
newborn screening is early
 
01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
identification and treatment if
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
needed the program is is reporting 2022
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
data due to the length of time it takes
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
to receive a confirmation of a disorder
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
it takes about a year to confirm a
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
disorder in calendar year 2022 there was
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
12,135 births with 99% of them being
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
screened of the infants who were
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
screened there was
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
732 infants who had an abnormal or
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
presumptive positive screen of those 30
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
had a confirmed heritable
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
condition 2022 was a year of Staff
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
transitions at the
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
department the program went from one FTE
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
to 2.5 FTE which brought the program to
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
Staffing capacity the positions are
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
supported by the revolving funds and a
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
Federal grant the program consists of a
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
nurse consultant a follow-up specialist
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
and a quality improvement
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
specialist each position has a unique
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
role in making sure that infants are
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
screened within 24 to 48 hours of life
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
and followed up if they have an abnormal
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
or presumptive positive
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
screen the program relies on timeliness
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
of specimen for optimal
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
results the program focused on two
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
quality improvement activities improving
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
timeliness and decreasing unsatisfactory
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
specimen the first quality improvement
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
activity was timeliness of specimen
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%

through the newborn screening
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
program I want to thank you for this
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present the 2022 annual
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
report I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
questions you might have Miss Kean on
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
page nine this wonderful little chart
 
01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.750 align:start position:0%
page nine this wonderful little chart
here

01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
um I would assume on on towns on the
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
border uh people in plastow might go God
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
help them to stward hospital in havil or
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
a little further west to Lawrence or
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
something is there any way that we get
 
01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:13.870 align:start position:0%
something is there any way that we get
that

01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
data no so this is only babies born in
 
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire okay uh second question is
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
there an increase in out of hos Hospital
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
births because of distance or because I
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
noticed Parkland and Derry is not on
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
this list so you're in Dairy and I'm
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
just plotting oh my gosh getting the car
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
quick and whoops we didn't make it um is
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
do you see a an increase in B should
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
that take place would it be fair to
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
assume then somebody continues the trip
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
into the hospital where the test is made
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
so there was a slight increase in out of
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
home um out of Hospital births um
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
midwives this is midwives too so
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
midwives have these filter papers um
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
that they use and draw the sample on the
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
infants good well thank you
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have a few questions my
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
one of the questions we talked about
 
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
previously you have 99% get screened
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'm assuming based on the chart
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
on six that that is a blood test that
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
done because there was clotting and
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
there was insufficient blood noted are
 
01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
are any of the screenings done currently
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
that involve you know urine or
 
01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.270 align:start position:0%
that involve you know urine or
saliva

01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
saliva
 
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
no this report is specific to the blood
 
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
only the blood yes so the 99% all of
 
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
them are basically blood tests correct
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
are these blood tests taken from the
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
baby the infant when born or are they
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
placental blood removed or this is from
 
01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
the baby itself yep so there's um it's a
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
paper that's about this big um and it
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
has four circles at the bottom of it and
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's taken from the infant's heel So
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
after 24 hours of Life blood is taken
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
from the infant to test for our
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
conditions this is a heel stick what
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that yes
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay and so I'm assuming then that you
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
know to to any other tests that would
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
require silver or saliva or urine would
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
be an increased cost it would be thank
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
you representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to show my ignorance
 
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
of which I have an abundance um
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
heritable does that mean
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
inherited okay I kind of assume so um
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
I've nothing heard that term before if I
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
may a to follow up follow up um getting
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
back to the Chairman's question about
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
like Parkland isn't on this list on on
 
01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:55.639 align:start position:0%
page nine I know Franklin has a hospital
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's not on this list various
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals aren't on this list could you
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
explain why that's the case do they not
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
they not do this
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
or so they have to have a maternity or
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery unit okay to do this
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
test however hospitals that don't have a
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
facility still have the test so if a
 
01:29:16.990 --> 01:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
baby comes into the emergency room at
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
Franklin and delivers the hospital has
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
one of these papers to do the test on
 
01:29:22.119 --> 01:29:22.830 align:start position:0%
one of these papers to do the test on
the

01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
child okay but does not attribute excuse
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
me did I
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
one uh but if it's if the baby is born
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
there and they have to do the paper but
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's not recorded as having Franklin
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
having done it or yes okay but it just
 
01:29:39.109 --> 01:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened there correct okay it's
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
very infrequent that we have a hospital
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
conduct a filter paper on they're called
 
01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
filter papers um on a baby that does not
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
have a labor and delivery or maternity
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
unit would the Assumption be the reason
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
not all Hospital hits are here could be
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're very very small and it's very
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
expensive to maintain this unit or they
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
are for profit facilities and do not see
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
this as a good loss leader for them I'm
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
Tilly hi good good morning again so um
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you this is a great
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
report and I think you all are asking
 
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
the right questions around access to
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery services in the state
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um I often show and and
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
my colleague Henry does as well there's
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
a map of New Hampshire sort of right
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
across the middle of the state in some
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
ways it's Route 11 from Claremont over
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
to Rochester we have lost all our
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
birthing facilities there we've also
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
lost facilities in the southern part of
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
the state as you notice with Parkland
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
and so um this is all a place where
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're seeing potentially increased
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
numbers of out of Hospital births as as
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
the question that you ask sometimes we
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
see people move to uh Midwife facilities
 
01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
um sometimes that's in the home
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are some birthing
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
facilities run by midwives there the
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
reason for those uh facilities to close
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
are multifactoral often it is because
 
01:31:10.350 --> 01:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
there are small numbers um Workforce is
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
really the biggest thing that drives it
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
to in order to have 24-hour coverage to
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
deliver babies is really expensive
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
especially for those small hospitals um
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
so that's why we've seen many of those
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals um close down
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
and then of course the for-profit
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals have their own um
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
rationalization for the services that
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
they choose to provide yeah Senator
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
Rosen Wald thank Youk you
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
um we've heard
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that some women are choosing
 
01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
home birth because they can't afford the
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
co-pay the or the co- Insurance the out
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
of pocket cost for either a hospital or
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
a freestanding birthing center and I'm
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
sure you guys have heard those reports
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
too but while that's concerning to me my
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
question is a home
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
birth that um would that
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
require the attempt to do the newborn
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
screening as well yes no matter who
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
attended yep even if it was just your
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
best friend yep thank you cuz they would
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
know about it they can opt out though as
 
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
well well they can but somehow if your
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
friend was attending your birth they
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
would somehow know they were required to
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
do newborn screening yeah so that's a
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
tricky question um most at home births
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
have some type of midwife following them
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
for their care I don't know and maybe
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
you do of any person who's not had any
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
prenatal care and then delivers at home
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
um but if a midwife is part of the
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
process they have one of these filter
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
papers that they would offer to the
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
family and the family can decline if
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
they would like to so yes so someone my
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
best friend could deliver but the
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
Midwife would be there to support and
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
chair with the evolution of at home
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
births or birth not inside of the
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
hospital is it possible in this chart
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
not for this time maybe for the future
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
to include a line in here for at home
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
burs that we can look at that point in
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
time is percentage are you referring to
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
the one on the last page on last page
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
page n yes we are currently in the works
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
of that um it just hasn't been done for
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
2022 data so the next report will
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
include out of or out of Hospital
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
births follow up on next question and
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
also on that report it's this is very
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
insightful is looking at just the
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
percentage but looking at overall burs
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
if you will within a facility because
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to understand is that if
 
01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that go down consistently
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
so we look at the claramont Rochester
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
that band in the middle if we're
 
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
starting to see a decrease in Birds
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
inside of a hospital hospital is
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
probably economically um they may be
 
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
closure so is there any way to get so a
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
trend of numbers of what's Happening not
 
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
just a percentage which is what you're
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with here but looking at the
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
number of births being um done within a
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
facility during over a period of time
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
because if it's trending down B
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
drastically that's probably not a good
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
thing in some ways can I ask a
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
clarifying question would you like to
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
see the number of infants born at each
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
hospital is that your question so like
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
region yes because it what I'm trying to
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
get to is in certain parts of the state
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
the rural parts of the state if we're
 
01:35:04.629 --> 01:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
seeing that go down dramatically for
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it's probably a
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
indication that something's happening um
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
it could be because of the number of
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
residents in the area itself which is
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
natural it could be because of other
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
economic issues going
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
on I was just going to say we are
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
tracking that data it is um we're
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
working closely with Medicaid and public
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
health together to understand those um
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
Dynamics especially in those rural areas
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
around where people are getting their
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
care Al we're also tracking that for
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
example in Sullivan County are you going
 
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
up to Dartmouth are you going down to
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
chesher those are all part of the data
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we're we're following but we can
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
report any further
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%

division of Public Health Services that
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
is a mouthful and it never gets easier
 
01:36:33.850 --> 01:36:33.860 align:start position:0%
how many business cards do it
 
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.030 align:start position:0%
how many business cards do it
[Laughter]

01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
take I have to cut some of them out
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
there um it is my pleasure to uh be

electronically at the beginning of the
 
01:36:56.189 --> 01:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
week um but you should have in front of
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
you the um executive summary and some
 
01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
data tables to follow along um to with
 
01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.550 align:start position:0%
data tables to follow along um to with
this

01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%

presentation
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay oh all right everybody set so the
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
State Office of rural health is
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to receive
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
available data and collect data through
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
provider surveying during the licensed
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
renewal Cycles to assess the current and
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated supply of primary care
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
providers in the state the data is
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
immensely valuable right it supports and

the executive summary
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%

01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
rurality okay so I'm going to move on
 
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
here to page
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
one um all right so table one on page
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
one um shows license types included in
 
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
this year's report um for medical
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
providers and Behavioral Health
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
Providers um and the data collection
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
period so um the report reflects data
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
collected in 2021 as our turnaround
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
period for reporting is two years after
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
the data is collected um some providers
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
you'll notice do have two-year combined
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
data that's to ensure reliable um St
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
statistics because of um for mental
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
health practitioners and psychologists
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's a Mal distribution of providers
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
by um licensed renewal year and then for
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
others like adex um or alcohol and drug
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
counselors in the state there's just a
 
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
low number of providers so combining
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
that two-year data gives us U more
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
stable statistics
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
there table two shows survey response
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
rates for State fiscal year
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
2021 um and you can compare the 2021
 
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
rates to um the 2020 rates in the column
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
right next to it for notable changes um
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
we can see here that there are
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
significant increases in in compliance
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
with aprns in the first row and mental
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
health practitioners that's likely a
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
result of the board rules being
 
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
promulgated in state fiscal year 2020
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the boards having more of a direct
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
hand and compliance followup and please
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
feel free to stop me and interrupt me if
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Weber yes
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
I just had one preliminary
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes what's the reason for the 2-year lag
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
data it takes a long time to clean and
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
organize and Report visualize the data
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
um It's really because our staff
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
capacity um within the program is me as
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh sort of the epie as well as the
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
administrator um and then we just hired
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
in this last year um a data analyst
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
programmer to try to speed things along
 
01:41:22.189 --> 01:41:22.199 align:start position:0%
but it's a steep learning curve we're
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
hoping um to have turnaround time about
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
a year after we're not there yet is that
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
because the data is reported in all
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of different formats from all kind
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
of different people not in different
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
formats we maintain the survey tool
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
within the program but the licensed
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
renewal Cycles differ I know that oplc
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
has changed that as of you know February
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
I think of 2023 they're starting to move
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
to Rolling renewals but with this data
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
before then it was that aprns and mental
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
health practitioners were just on
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
rolling Cycles While others like Pas
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
were October to December um adex were
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
April to June so it sort of is
 
01:42:04.629 --> 01:42:04.639 align:start position:0%
scattered you're
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
welcome okay the average response rate
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
across provider types is 90% right which
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
is great we're hoping to maintain or
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
increase that rate for Reliable
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative data um with continued
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
compliance enforcement by
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
oplc now completion of the opt out form
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
does Meet The Lure requirement we love
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
to see that it's remained low though
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
since implementation it remains at about
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
1 to 2% um and it's great because the
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
rich survey collected from the survey
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
tool really does allow for those
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
in-depth specialty analyses for
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Workforce
 
01:42:45.719 --> 01:42:47.390 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Workforce
assessment

01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
okay so page
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
two page two contains uh Supply changes
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
according to the license list figures
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
maintained by oplc so the net change
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
percent that's all the way to the right
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
um demonstrates no true loss of
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
providers during State fiscal year 2021
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
um we see that psychologists broke about
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
even um minimal increases for physicians
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
in adax and then some saw significant
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
gains especially for APNs where we see
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce gains nearing 25% and PAs at
 
01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.390 align:start position:0%
Workforce gains nearing 25% and PAs at
20%

01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
20%
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
now I'm sure you're all thinking this
 
01:43:28.350 --> 01:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
but the increases likely do come in part
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
as a result of several executive orders
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
issued during the New Hampshire covid-19
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
state of emergency that ease barriers to
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
lure and clinical practice so
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly right we see this influx
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
of aprns and P pasas that have very
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
similar scopes of practice as Physicians
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
right they can work in a variety of
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
settings and they can practice largely
 
01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.310 align:start position:0%
settings and they can practice largely
independently

01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
independently
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
what's not clear with the licensing list
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
figures is um whether these new
 
01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
providers are practicing at the top of
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
their license or whether they're just
 
01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
aiding in in pandemic efforts um so
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
we'll just continue to analyze this data
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
see how future um years compare um I
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
have a guess but uh we'll see that shake
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
on all
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
righty page three here I'm just going to
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
highlight a few interesting Workforce
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
statistics for medical providers um
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's much more in the in the full
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
report but these um few sort of stuck
 
01:44:36.669 --> 01:44:36.679 align:start position:0%
out to me so table 4.1 has the
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
percentage of clinically active
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
providers across medical provider types
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's those providers who have an
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
active status license that are
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
clinically practicing in New Hampshire
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
we can see about 3ars of AP aprns are
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
doing that over 90% of PA
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
but the physician rate is just over 60%
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
considerably less and that's a rate we
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
see consistent year to year um I love to
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
point this out at every opportunity
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
because it really um shows value for
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
this program if we were only to use the
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
lure list to estimate Supply we would be
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
grossly overestimating the supply of
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
physicians in this
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
state table 4.2 shows the percentage of
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
primary care providers of those
 
01:45:28.109 --> 01:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
clinically active in New Hampshire um
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
Physicians and aprns are about 20% of
 
01:45:32.589 --> 01:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
those clinically active are in primary
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
care practice 16% of Pas there is no
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
National Benchmark here um but this
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
percentage does fall short of the
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
recommended 40% of active providers in
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
Primary Care by the na uh National
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:54.669 --> 01:45:54.679 align:start position:0%
education table 4. four uh summarizes
 
01:45:57.589 --> 01:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
anticipated Supply indicators which um
 
01:45:59.310 --> 01:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
obviously helps to paint the picture of
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
future healthc care supply in the state
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
so the first couple um provider age this
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
helps to inform anticipated Supply where
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
younger providers can offset uh
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages that come from
 
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
provider retirement um we can see that
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
for primary care aprns about a third um
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
of them are uh under 40 years old this
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
is about two times higher than those 60
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
years and older for Pas we see an even
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
greater Gap that 45% are under 40 um and
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's three and a half times those that
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
are um 60 years or older however we see
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
the very opposite is true for Physicians
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
where um about a third or 60 years and
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
older and this is about 2 and a half
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
the anticipated practice figures for uh
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians also a bit
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
discouraging here we see about a third
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
of primary care physicians anticipate a
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
reduction in practice in the next 5
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
years of that of those about
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
20% plan to not practice in New
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at all so that's either by
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
practicing in another state or just
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
ceasing clinical practice
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
altogether I will say that these
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
statistics it's it's not on the chart
 
01:47:29.550 --> 01:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
but um I like to you know add some of
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
the um comparisons that I can from the
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
previous year these statistics are a bit
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
worse than what we saw in 2020 data um
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
so that suggests right that this these
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
indicators were likely impacted by the
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic so we'll see if this changes um
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
oh actually I want to add just a one
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
more thought or a couple of thoughts to
 
01:47:59.199 --> 01:48:00.709 align:start position:0%
more thought or a couple of thoughts to
this

01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
um Bleak picture that I painted for a
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
physician Supply in this in the state we
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
do see right this big picture that we
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
can expect a continued decrease in
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
physician Supply um however a a key
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
practice measure that could offset this
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
is inate training inate residency um we
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
have three Family Medicine residencies
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
currently in the state we have two
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
underdevelopment in rural areas um
 
01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's Coos family and and Cheshire
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
Family Medicine residencies we can
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
expect the primary care physician to
 
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
increase Supply to
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
increase um with increased access to
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
instate training um the other
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
consideration here is with uh respect to
 
01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
supply gains um education Trends and
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
retention indicators that we saw here
 
01:48:56.750 --> 01:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's possible that aprns could also
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
counterbalance this um future physician
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
loss uh while you're on that subject uh
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
could you tell me where the three Family
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
Practice residencies in New Hampshire
 
01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.750 align:start position:0%
Practice residencies in New Hampshire
are

01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
located yes one is at Dartmouth
 
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Medical Center right yes I'm
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
goingon to one is at the conquered
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
hospit it is connected to Dartmouth
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock at conquered hospital and the
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
the other is the Portsmith Regional
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
Hospital thank you I believe
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
that yes those was are still yes just
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
yes Miss Jim thank you yes go ahead
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
doctor do you have that broken down um
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
as to where these anticipated uh
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
reduction and practice in 5 years are
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
located meaning that is it worse in the
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
North country the western side of the
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
state or southern part of the state or
 
01:49:59.070 --> 01:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
where is it most where is it where we
 
01:50:00.589 --> 01:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
going to feel that feel that impact most
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
we do we are going to move actually to
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
to um that breakdown not by Public
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
Health Region not by you know Town level
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
not by county level um we do see well we
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
do break it down by rurality so rural
 
01:50:22.109 --> 01:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
versus non-rural in previous years we
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
did see that there was a discrepancy
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
there that there were higher rates of
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated reduction in practice in
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
rural areas we don't see that with this
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
data we're guessing because of the
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic and provider burnout so it's
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
because of a spike in non- rural rates
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
is why we're no longer seeing that
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
discrepancy question for either one of
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
you um is the medical school at
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth holding steady with the number
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
increasing I I haven't heard of
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
additional seats um being added to the
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
program but I don't know that it's
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
increased at all but it is relatively
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
new as is a chesher one okay um no I
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
mean at the med school you want to go be
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
an MD and oh w w how many are graduating
 
01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
and going into Primary Care no is the
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
number graduating constant or are they
 
01:51:19.149 --> 01:51:19.159 align:start position:0%
increasing the spots there I believe
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
that number is St fairly stable okay but
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
the number of people going into primary
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
care has dropped off
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
precipitously University of New England
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
in bitterford Maine is increasing its
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
number of spots and we know osteopaths
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
tend to prefer uh Primary Care uh at a
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
much larger rate than MDS so there is
 
01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:41.719 align:start position:0%
some help there and especially with
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
ports Smith's uh residency right and I
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
believe there's also opportunity through
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
un to have some clinical rotations in
 
01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
rural parts of um the state through
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
their program
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
well we're not rural in Kingston
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
although we don't have very many people
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
there but we do take such rotations at
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
the facility I'm part-time CEO of so
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's hope yes thank you
 
01:52:10.109 --> 01:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
welcome okay so um looking at table uh
 
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
four this is the breakdown of practice
 
01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
by geography and clinical practice so we
 
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
see across all provider types about a
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
third of practice
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
is in rural um with primary care
 
01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
practice representing only a fraction of
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
total practice um especially for Pas
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
where we see um primary care practice
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
extremely limited um just that 3% um it
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
makes it so that we can't really get
 
01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
those filters on there to dive into the
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
data um for
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
Pas uh as we can for aprns and
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
Physicians the figures one and two right
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
under that table come a new analysis to
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
this report showing primary care uh
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
practice distribution by Public Health
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
Region and as a proportion of total
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
practice um overall practice it should
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
be represented by a blue bar I believe
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's black because our copy are only
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
prints in black and
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
white and outpatient primary care
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
practice as a proportion of total
 
01:53:17.069 --> 01:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
practice should be an orange I believe
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's in Gray um and we see with this
 
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
that while overall practice is more
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
variable across the state right we see
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
um high amounts of practice in Upper
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
Valley in figure one for the rural
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
Public Health regions and also very high
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
in Greater
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester in figure two um with the
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
non-rural public health regions but what
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
we see for primary care practice is it's
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
more consistent across the state
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all right so page five uh
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
tables 5.1 through 5.3 show significant
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
differences in provider and practice
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
characteristics by rurality so all of
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
these characteristics here aren't those
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
that were tested it's those that were
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
found to be statistically um different
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
between rural and non- rural um areas of
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
the state some interesting changes not
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
on there but that I want to point out
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
again from 2020 analysis um to point out
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
just because it's likely pandemic
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
related is that there's no longer as I
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
said a difference in anticipated
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
reduction of practice between rural and
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
non-rural um areas because of the spike
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
and non-rural rates um the other
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
difference um is that or other change is
 
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
that there's no longer a difference in
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
the rates of imgs or International
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
Medical graduates between rural and
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
non-rural because of a spike again in
 
01:54:42.719 --> 01:54:44.510 align:start position:0%
non-rural because of a spike again in
non-rural

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
non-rural
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
rates a new trend we see um across all
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
three provider uh all three provider
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
types is that is a higher rate of newly
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
trained providers in rural compared to
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
non- rural um according to the
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
indicators graduation within the last 10
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
years for all three types and then
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire for un uh
 
01:55:10.589 --> 01:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
under five years for APNs and PAs um
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
we'll see again right if this trend
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
continues or if it's an artifact of the
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic um I would be remiss if I
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
didn't point out two characteristics and
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
and that sort of go along with that idea
 
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
I said earlier about really the
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
importance of um you know training and
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
and pipeline for our providers um it's
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
that rural Physicians are more likely to
 
01:55:37.629 --> 01:55:37.639 align:start position:0%
have graduated from a New Hampshire
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
Medical School and and to have trained
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
in a residency within the state these
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
findings we see consistent year-to year
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
um and it is important right because it
 
01:55:51.149 --> 01:55:51.159 align:start position:0%
tells us that if we want greater access
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
to healthcare and work we need to
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
efforts representative Merchant thank
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.709 --> 01:56:07.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking the question
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
you're welcome if one of the key factors
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
is graduating from a school medical
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
school in New Hampshire is there any
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts of working with University of
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to create a medical school
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
I mean not trying to take away from
 
01:56:25.149 --> 01:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
medic Dartmouth but if we have a growing
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
need and one of the factors is where
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
they graduate
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
from is there any discussion going on
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
about trying to find a way to develop a
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
medical school or osteopathic school
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
either one um in New Hampshire itself
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
with unb instead of the
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
basis I haven't heard those discussions
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
um I I will say you know obviously apart
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
from Physicians and speaking about
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
another advanced practice type APRN UNH
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
does have a grant um called a new
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
advanced nursing education Workforce um
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
program where they are training APRN
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
specifically to work in rural areas and
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
unders medically underserved areas of
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
the state so I do know that that
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
initiative um is ongoing with with
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
Federal grant with a Federal Grant I
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
haven't heard those discussions but
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
certainly it's worth bringing up at um
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
one of the upcoming uh commission
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
meetings on the interdisciplinary
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
Primary Care
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce thank
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
you Senator Rosenwald and I are over
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
here plotting in some things so yeah yes
 
01:57:41.229 --> 01:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
well that's why this right report is so
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
important to bring this to policy makers
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
attention um you all are the ones that
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
really affect the change so um and we're
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
always happy to have you at that Primary
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
Care Commission meeting any further
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
other representative uh whoever has the
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
don't we we were we were told we were
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
told from the floor the other day that
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
if women just had more babies
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
anyway uh any other questions because we
 
01:58:44.430 --> 01:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
have exactly two minutes left all right
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
we're we've made it to the last page I'm
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
hoping to get through this one because
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
this is another um exciting new analysis
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
that we added uh to this report and and
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
plan to continue to keep it in this
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
report moving forward um this is the
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
primary care provider rate per
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
population um we can see here in table
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
6.1 that rates are highest for
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
Physicians um at 54 Primary Care um FTE
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
providers per 100,000 resident
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
population um but if we look at the
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
supply by licenses in the state at the
 
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page here we can see
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's many more Physicians licensed in
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
the state at 8,500 than there are aprns
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know there's twice the number of as
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
there are aprns and especially um Pas so
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
with this in mind um the rate of you
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
know 30 providers per resident
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
population for AP parents is relatively
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
High when taking Supply into
 
01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
consideration the combined out patient
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
Primary Care rate is about 94 that's the
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
last row in the first um table that
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
translates to um one primary care
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
provider for every 1,66 people now um
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
sort of as I had said with the
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of um primary care providers
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
relative to all um active providers in
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
the state there is no hard and fast
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
Benchmark for this but wh estimates that
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
at least two and a half Primary Care
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
Providers per 1,000 people are needed
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
for adequate Primary Care coverage and
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's one and a half times as many as
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have statewide according to this
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
analysis what was the number
 
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
yes looking at table 6.2 um this ranks
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
the uh Public Health regions by rate so
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
we can see actually the top three rates
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
are all in rural um upper valleys number
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
one this should really come as no
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
surprise Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
Center sits in Upper Valley it also has
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
