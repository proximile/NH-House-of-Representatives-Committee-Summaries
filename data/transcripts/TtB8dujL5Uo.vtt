00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
light on after I've stopped talking
 
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
remind me thank
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
members of the election law committee
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
for having me today happy to be here uh
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
today I'm here to introduce cicr 17 a
 
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to create a
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
ballot initiative process in the state
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I'd kind of like to
 
00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:41.879 align:start position:0%
begin by telling you where this idea
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
came from um I remember specifically um
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
when I thought of putting this in it was
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
uh spring of 2021 and the senate had
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
voted 15 to nine to kill a cannabis bill
 
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
that had come before it that had already
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
passed the house by nearly a veto proof
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
margin uh we've seen seen a cycle like
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
this over the years where a bill on that
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
topic will come out of the house with a
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
pretty solid veto proof margin go over
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
to the Senate and die uh an issue with
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
broad bipartisan support in the state of
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire clears a large hurdle in
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
the house the body that is closest to
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
the people takes one step into the
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
Senate and stops uh I was frustrated by
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
this as many Granite Staters were likely
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
frustrated by it and so I thought you
 
00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
know this is a decent idea to put into
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
cacr for but expanding beyond that um
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
there issues that I probably wouldn't
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
think of that have similar bip broad
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support so I felt like um
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
having a ballot measure initiative as
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
some other states do um you've likely
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
seen them in prop a prop B those kind of
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
things um would be a good thing to have
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so um for
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
the presentation I would just like to go
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
over uh line three and talk about some
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
of the uh specifics I tried my absolute
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
hardest because a lot of people have
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
different opinions on what should be um
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
the standards to get something on the
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
ballot um I did my best to try to strike
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
a balance between restrictive and
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable um so not having a bar that's
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
so high that it can't be surmounted um
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
but having a bar that's high enough so
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
five people in the state of New
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can't get like joke items on
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
the ballot um I felt like that was an
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
important distinction um on the first uh
 
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
on line five when it says when 5% of the
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
total registered voters petition the
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State uh this is how it
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
happens in uh the recall process that
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
California has uh where it's 12% of the
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
voters um there was discussion about
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
making it a percentage of the previous
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
election attendance um but I felt 5% of
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
the total registered voters was more
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate given that elections can
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
have pretty wide disparities between
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
turnout um you can have a 2010 level uh
 
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
where the turnout is lower and you can
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
have a 2020 level uh where turnout is a
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
record high I don't think it's fair to
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
have um distinctions and different bars
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
for items to cross depending on which
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
year you're filing it um so 5% of the
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
total registered voters um that also
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
makes it a percentage and not a number
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
um which I think is helpful um I think
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
putting a specific number in the
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution um over time as population
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
increased would make it dramatically uh
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
easier like I said to get certain joke
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
items on the ballot uh that we'd want to
 
00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:44.150 align:start position:0%
try to
avoid

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
um if the question receives a majority
 
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
of the vote in favor the law the
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
question shall become law in the state
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire within a year of the
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
election in which it was asked the
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of that line um in my research a
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
lot of ballot measure and ballot
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
initiative processes and other other
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
states um they'll have the question on
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
the ballot that is more vague Maine is a
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
perfect example of this um a couple
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
years ago Maine through ballot
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
initiative uh affirmed a Medicaid
 
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
expansion um the legislature was still
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
required to act on that the legislature
 
00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
was still required to put it in their
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
version of an RSA you know there's not
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
just a law in Maine that says the
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
complicated program of Medicaid is now
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
law and that's the end of that sentence
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
um it provides a legislative route for
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
some of the details to be hammered out
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
but it does provide a constitutional
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
imperative that the body acts if the uh
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
vote does receive a majority in favor um
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
and the last line um it's a little vague
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
but part of this is going to be what I
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
thought the rulemaking power of the
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office um May
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
establish a process to ensure the intent
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
of the question is carried out um almost
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
like an OS process uh is what I was
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
envisioning on there where um to make
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
sure that the question on the ballot is
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the party petitioning um
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
with the authenticated signatures and
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
the 5% of the registered voters so um I
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
guess at the end of the day I'm not
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
married to the guard rails there um if
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know if folks feel like an amendment
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
might be NE necessary or warranted to
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
alter those um I'm ultimately fine with
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
that um My ultimate goal here is just to
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
have um a process with
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
which almost uncontested principles um
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
that have 70 80% support within the
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire have an easier
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
process of becoming law um than you know
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
as other states have um so that's where
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
I'm at on that um I can take any
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
to thank you representative does do any
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have questions
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you I'm representative
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you um I'm sorry I blank out
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
when you said what's the percentage in
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
California that has to be did you say
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
12% yeah my understanding is that it's
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
12% of Voters
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's 12% of the voters in
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
the previous election okay um yeah which
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
again I don't love that because um I
 
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
think it creates unfair bars for issues
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
to uh compete with in different years
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
based on the turnout of the previous
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
election so just to solid 5% of
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
registered voters I think is uh more
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
fair for each question can I have a
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
followup one other question was what
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
would uh prevent say getting 10 or 15 of
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
these on a ballot and really making it
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
difficult or do you just think it's that
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
would be my question can I ask can staff
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
is Staff here in the room can you te is
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
representative Lane being picked up
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
because I'm having a hard time hearing
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
much um is there any pre way to prevent
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
saying getting 10 or 15 of these on a
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
ballot because I know some people
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
complain that there's so many of them on
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
a ballot it kind of clutters the ballot
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it makes it difficult to get
 
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.670 align:start position:0%
and it makes it difficult to get
anything

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
past um technically there isn't um as I
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
said I tried really hard to uh find a
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
decent what I thought balance between uh
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
restrictive and reasonable um my guess
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
if I had to estimate was that you know
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
in any given election you wouldn't see
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh more than two or three of these uh it
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
would be similar to uh the
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
Constitutional amendment process we have
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
now only it wouldn't require the
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of each body um I really
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
can't see this being you know 10 or 15
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
items on each ballot because you know
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
there is a 90-day window to get 5% of
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
the registered voters in the state
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
authenticated and it is a process it is
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
um a process intended to um stop some
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
sillier ones uh but also provide you
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
know a very reasonable voice within the
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
Affairs of the
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
state other questions representative
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
Barry um yes
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
so for the Constitutional Amendment part
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
of this is it just a simple majority of
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
the voters to change the New Hampshire
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution is that it correct
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.550 align:start position:0%
Constitution is that it correct
okay

00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
and oh I had a follow follow and um on
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
the excuse me on the um legislative side
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
the enaction of laws not the
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution what's to stop the
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislature from coming in and
 
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.629 align:start position:0%
legislature from coming in and
immediately

00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
undoing what the uh what the voters have
 
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.990 align:start position:0%
undoing what the uh what the voters have
just

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
passed um so I'm doing everybody's
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
favorite thing of uh reading into the
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
word shall on that um there are states
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
where things have passed on the ballot
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
and they don't have specific text in
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
their constitution or rsas that say you
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
have to do this thing
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
um theoretically um if you want to play
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
games with the word shall that could be
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
ignored um I think it would
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative if you're talking about
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
the word shall are we talking about line
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
six correct okay uh yeah the the purpose
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
of that line is to create a
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional imperative for the
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to act on that my suspicion
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
is that there if something were to uh
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
pass by going through this process and
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
creating that broad uh of demonstration
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
of support uh there would be fairly
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
decent backlash to just ignoring that um
 
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
or reversing that um it's not a great
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
answer but it it's you know what I would
 
00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:20.919 align:start position:0%
suspect would be
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
there thank you further questions from
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
the committee representative prome O
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
Brien good morning
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh do you think that the ability of the
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
citizens to contact their
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
representatives and ask them to address
 
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
these issues that you think would be
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
addressed this way that when there's one
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative for every 3,000 citizens
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
in our state do you think that that's
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
insufficient it's not necessarily that I
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
think it's insufficient but I think um
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
especially in a more um partisan
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
environment that we feel now uh some
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
folks in legislative capacities may be
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
less likely to uh feel the need to
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
engage on some of those more broad
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh issues I I keep going back
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
to uh the Cannabis issue polling
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
suggests that that specific issue uh
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
does 70 plus perc in the state of New
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and just struggles to get
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process uh each
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
time it's
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
um so that that speaks to um one of the
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
filing I'm just gonna leave this on
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you madam chair um so
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.470 align:start position:0%
my question
is

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
if if the for the Cannabis situation if
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue that voters
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily care about they wouldn't
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily petition and only vote for
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
candidates that support legalization of
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis I guess what my point is is
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
that it's if it doesn't pass a legisla
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
process it might just not be an issue
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
that voters are petitioning as much as
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
like you know taxes or gun control or
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
things like that so I guess what I'm
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
wondering is
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
like why put it on the ballot if it
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't even pass the muster of like
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
priority for the
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
legislature so I think I can answer that
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um with the Liberty um in um expanding
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
upon the point that I think I was trying
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
to make just a minute ago
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
um as a member of a specific party I am
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
extremely unlikely in any circumstance
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
given the broad scope of issues that
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
each of the two parties represent to
 
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
vote for a member of a different party
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
based on one specific issue so if I
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
admittedly late I'm a Democrat and um I
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
agree with the Democratic candidate 90%
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
of the time um on issues of uh climate
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh the economy but my Republican
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
candidate for State Rep is better on the
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
issue of cannabis and that is an issue
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
that I care about am I as a voter going
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
to sacrifice 90% of the issues that I
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
agree with to vote for a candidate who
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to loath most of the time
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
because they were decent on one issue or
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
is there an Avenue to say I still want
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
to vote for this person because I agree
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
with them on 90% of the things and I'm
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
going to take this one issue out of
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
political consideration by trying to get
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
it on the ballot so that uh it's devoid
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you and representative I
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
when you started talking about loathing
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
people of certain
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
parties so I tried to make the point the
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%

00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
cacr uh I wasn't planning on testifying
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
I did hear a few Concepts in the
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
discussion that I wanted to speak
 
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
briefly to some of you know that I teach
 
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
American government at Community College
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and just for definition sake I want
 
00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about democracy I
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot of times people will say we
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
have a republic not a democracy so for
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
definition because I'm going to use the
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
word democracy a little bit um there are
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
two kinds of democracies there 's direct
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
democracy and representative democracy
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
we are in a representative democracy
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
which is also known as a republic so a
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
republic is a style of democracy a
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
flavor uh one of two flavors now having
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
said that direct democracies are where
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
everyone votes on every issue and that
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
would be very unwieldy and and um
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
problematic so there aren't too many
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
however amongst republics there are
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
republics that lean a little bit more
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
towards the direct style and a little
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
bit more towards the more like kind of I
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
don't know what you want to say
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
separated from the people style here in
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we very proudly as
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative pban pointed out are very
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
connected to our people and I'm very
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
proud um that we are kind of a more
 
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
direct style uh Republic in that sense
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
and along those lines I think that
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
having a ballot initiative as I've
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
supported in the past helps connect us
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
directly now in terms of why would we
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
need about an initiative since we are so
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
connected well I think maybe every
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
single member in this room might have
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
had the same experience as me and not
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
being able to reach a fellow member and
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
if I can't reach a fellow member and get
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
an answer on an issue what hope does a
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
constituent have sometimes of reaching a
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
member and getting an answer on an issue
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
or getting them to act in their favor um
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
a question about do we limit um how can
 
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
we limit uh the number of questions so
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't like clutter up the ballot I
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
think um you could potentially amend it
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
to say the first three ballot
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
initiatives that meet the requirements
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be included any other one that
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
meets the requirements after that would
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
cycle also the idea of can't legislators
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
just reverse something that the people
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
did yes technically but the reason that
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't is simply pressure can you
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
imagine if an overwhelming majority of
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
people supported something being a
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
legislator going going no the people are
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
wrong um I think politically that would
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
be not advisable for that that
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
member also issues what kind of issues
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
would uh be on a ballot initiative other
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
than the marijuana issue you all are
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
about to hear about rank Choice voting
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
coming up in Maine the legislators did
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
not want to act on this issue and fought
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
it and the people of Maine overturned
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
them overturned their own legislators
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it was successful and not only
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't successful but you will hear from
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
a member of the Secretary of State's
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
office in Maine about how successful it
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
was so it turns out in that particular
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
example the people had more wisdom than
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
their legislators so I just wanted to
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
touch on those few issues thank you so
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
much for your time I'm happy to answer
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
questions but I suspect all the members
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
answered thank you representative Reed
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me as I listen to this that
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
a sort of presented in as article 11a as
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
actual

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
petition will go on the local ballots
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding the cacr
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
process and it would go on a state
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
election ballot correct
 
00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.190 align:start position:0%
election ballot correct
correct

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
and how do do you determine whether the
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
issue is one for a general election if
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
the process is no longer going through
 
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.909 align:start position:0%
the process is no longer going through
the

00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
legislature um how do you determine if
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for a Statewide ballot
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
right that's a very good question Madam
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
chair and I do not have the answer to
 
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.630 align:start position:0%
chair and I do not have the answer to
that

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
one because is it fair to say let's
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
say it's not coming to mind but I can I
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
I given I think the 5% is probably a
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
pretty high bar so I'm sort of
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
hypothetically saying okay we can meet
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
that um I can see where there are issues
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
that could be brought forward on a local
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
level that would be traditionally dealt
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
with at a local level that would now end
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
up on this state ballot in a general
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
election because that's the intent but
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say it right the intent is
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
for this to go on a Statewide ballot a
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide ballot but it's not limited to
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
that well I presume that the threshold
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
is high enough that if it were merely a
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
single town or County issue that you
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to meet the requirement
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't actually say total
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
registered voters of the state it just
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
says total registered voters so could I
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
argue that it's total registered voters
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
of my community since I'm going to
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
petition my Selectmen I would I would
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
argue that it means that it needs to be
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
amended to say of the state thank you
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
repres representative
 
00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:01.519 align:start position:0%
Barry I appreciate the uh distinction of
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
Republic and direct democracy um glad to
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
know you're a American government
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
teacher um I'm a political science guy
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
myself um I studied American government
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and I studied the founding fathers
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
who wrote extensively about the tyranny
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the majority um and that's why we
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
have this complicated system of
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
government which as much as people don't
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
like to admit it is designed not to pass
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
things it's l designed for gridlock so
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
that when the legislator is doing things
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's only doing things that are really
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
important the cooling saucer uh yes um
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
so what I'm and the reason we have our
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
the reason we have this system um is
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
because their direct democracies Tyran
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
and majority it's not up for debate
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
right if 50.1% of the people show up and
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
say they want this and 49.9 show up and
 
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
say they don't which this bill allows
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
for right by the way it's not we're
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
proposing these issues which are 70 80%
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
approval but there's nothing that stops
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
something from passing with 50.1 um the
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
reason we have this legislative process
 
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:04.120 align:start position:0%
reason we're legislators right is that
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to look into issues dive
 
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
into it and make the best decisions for
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
our constituency right and for me
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's examples of that right where I
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
break party ranks um just last week I
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
voted uh to punish St gobain um for
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
polluting the water because I represent
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
the town of Lichfield and St gobain has
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
polluted the water um and they deserve
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
to be punished and you know I broke
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
party ranks because that's what I do as
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
a as a representative my party said send
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
it did you share and I said no these
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
people are evil um they deserve to be
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
punished so how are you not short
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
changing that process with this right
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're just sending things you know our
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
job is to look into things our job is to
 
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
dig into this if you took me and dumped
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
me in transportation I wouldn't know
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
what to do you put me in election law
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
and I I happen to be
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
very um good at this so how are we how
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
process thank you for the question and
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
the background and as someone who
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
recently was in the news for uh quite
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
publicly breaking party ranks um I can
 
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comment um and what I
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
would say is this doesn't overturn that
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we have plenty of states that
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
have valid initiatives that doesn't
 
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
overturn it you still elect
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
representatives they still vote on the
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
vast majority of technical issues if you
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
look at all the propositions that come
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
up in the different states they are
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
usually propositions that have to do
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
with they're not very technical issues
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
like Mar Iana or you know in the past
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
gay marriage they're more just are the
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
people ready to move forward from
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
traditional to something else is it it's
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
more philosophical and Broad and not um
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
very technical so you don't have for
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
example propositions popping up across
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
the country about how many parts per
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
million arsonic can we allow should it
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
be five or six right um so you are
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct that one of the
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
dangers of a pure direct democracy is
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
that the people are not educated enough
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
on those is issues and end up voting
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
poorly and I think we can all make
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
arguments that sometimes that even
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
happens in our representative process
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
where people are not educated on the
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
people they're electing and vote poorly
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
but to that point when you say tyranny
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
of the majority it was certainly a
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
concern of the founders um but it wasn't
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
the only concern of direct democracy of
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
the founders but it was one of them but
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we already have that
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
potential it only takes 50% plus one to
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
elect a Tyrant into office or elect
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to be a tyrant into
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
office now right so we still have that
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
threat all this does is it barely moves
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
the needle over to if the people want to
 
00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
put a question they have to overcome
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
that threshold then the people have to
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
vote by 51% on a particular question I
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
think the point that U Madam chair made
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
earlier about is it appropriate to be on
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
the Statewide ballot might be uh
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of what you're
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
talking about like is this something
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
that we can really put on a Statewide
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
ballot does is it appropriate um and and
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
could that be problematic so I'd like to
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
kind of explore that issue a little bit
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
more thank you any further questions for
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
representative Reed on the bill we are
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
currently conducting a public hearing on
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
C 17 representative prto O'Brien you can
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
stay in your seat I'll get to you I
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
promise I feel like
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
horack that a lot of people aren't going
 
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
to remember that uh
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of what you said when you
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
said the people in Maine had more wisdom
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
than their own elected officials when
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
they pass rank Choice voting this
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
way but here in New Hampshire I I said
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
we had one s we
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
had one representative in the in the
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
house per
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
3,000 citizens what are what's that
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
number in
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
Maine oh you're you're AB if you don't
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
know maybe the person that's coming
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
later to speak on that from the
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office in Maine can
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
can I I'm I'm almost positive she can
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
answer that I don't have that it is
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
larger than than ours obviously because
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
we are a small state and we have the
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
largest State Rep um representative body
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
um but I'm completely with you that I
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
know there are legislators that support
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
reducing the size of our body I am
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
adamantly not one of those I really
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that I am accessible
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
to my constituents so I'm not at all
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting that but you're right that
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps that kind of distance does breed
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
like less understanding of what the
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
people want or less accountabil
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
accountability to the people having said
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
that like I said I may contact someone
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
on this committee and not hear back or I
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
may ask another representative to do a
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
small favor and not hear back so if I'm
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
having those problems how many how much
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
more problems are the 3,000 constituents
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
of that representative possibly
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
having thank you as a follow followup
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
I think that question okay would you
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
believe that I uh I've had a different
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
experience where as a citizen before I
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
became in the legislature contacting my
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
state representative to talk to them
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
about something was a much different
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
experience than Representatives
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
contacting representatives and I had
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
positive experiences with that would you
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
believe that I I would believe that both
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
positive and negative experiences happen
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
both as a legislator and as a
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
constituent and I'm sure we all know
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
people who've had both positive and
 
00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:31.550 align:start position:0%
people who've had both positive and
negative

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:34:33.629 --> 00:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
experiences thank you further questions
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
Reed I think that I'll be back all
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
right all right so this does close the
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
CA CAC
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
R17 um we I'm going to turn my mic off
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go through here um
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and make sure all the committee members
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
have handouts that are available for the
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
next presentations which are all related
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
to each other that I expect we will be
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
spending the majority of time on HB
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
1482 so um hold on we'll get going
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
officially in a minute and Christina all
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do is turn off my mic
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm assuming that will shut the
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
vid the sound down and the video will
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:55.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:55.670 align:start position:0%

he you okay I
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm reconvening the election law
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee it is
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
10:25 um if you're on this side of the
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
room and apparently you're five minutes
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
behind me if you're at the other side of
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
the room so I hope whatever the space
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
continuum is working for the audio here
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
um we are about to open the hearing on
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
1482 the reality is here in the election
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
law we have
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
1482 relative to rank Choice voting
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
follow followed by
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
1264 relative to rank Choice voting for
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
State party primaries and
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
aacr relating to all
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
elections um these have been placed in
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
order on the calendar at the request of
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor so that hopefully as
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
we go through this in our uh efforts to
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
understand what is being presented to us
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
we can sort of get the big picture and
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
follow the bills through in that regards
 
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:26.839 align:start position:0%
I'm also accommodating requests for the
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
order of speakers because there are
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
people who have come in with various um
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
presentation materials to try and um
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
convey uh the logistics of what this
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
request would um do so with that um 1482
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
relative to rank Choice voting the prime
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor is representative Reed and she
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
believe that we are really going to try
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
to focus on answering technical details
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee and really diving into
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
this issue it has been before this
 
00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
committee not all all of the members
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
obviously uh before but to that end uh I
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
do have uh here ready to testify uh
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%

00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
experience uh as well as Professor

00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%

but former Utah GOP chair uh Tiani
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
Coleman um so anyway with
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
that let me take you on a time traveling
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
Journey back to when we started this
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
crazy thing called democracy with all
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
the voting and stuff um it isn't what we
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
have in terms of you go and vote Whoever
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
has the most votes wins right that makes
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
sense it's what we've all grown up with
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
that started really a long time ago and
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's a a simple but kind of
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
antiquated thing hear me out from old
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
England when no one thought of more
 
00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
sophisticated ways to accurately
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
represent people's wishes so the
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
philosophy was majority
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
rule which is great when you have two
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
people running because whoever gets the
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
most votes by definition gets 50% Plus
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
at least one um but when you have more
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
than two people running in an election
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't end up with a winner
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
support uh you have what's called vote
 
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
splitting or spoiler effect so you may
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
have one candidate that 2third of the
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
the people do not want in a threers race
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
the two-thirds get their vote split
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
between two other candidates none of
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
them wanted the third person but because
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
they he the the other two candidates
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
split that anti- person vote that person
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
wins with 34% of the vote when you have
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
more than three people it can get even
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
Haier you have the potential for people
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
winning with 20% 12% of the vote are
 
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
these people that actually have the most
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
support we don't know
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
now because we have this system where
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
votes can get split and we don't know
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
where actual um the the actual desire of
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
is uh we have the spoiler effect and
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
wasted votes so so people casting their
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
ballots for any candidate who isn't one
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
of the major two parties in contention
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
are essentially wasting their votes in
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
many elections and what that means is we
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
get driven into a two-party system and
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
the two-party system as we know has
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
become more and more and more divisive
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
because as those two parties become the
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
only Power holders in our
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
democracy um everyone is forced into one
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
of two camps not because that's
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily where their true desires lay
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
but because fear of the the greater evil
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
in essence more and more voters are
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
voting for the lesser of two evils or
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
the evil of two
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
lessers but the point is is that we all
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
recognize the divisiveness in our system
 
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
we all recognize that sometimes winners
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
win when they don't have the most
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
support or other candidates would have
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
had more support but we haven't um
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily figured out the right way to
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
get past that now having said that many
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
States including ours have attempted to
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
get past this problem mostly by
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
instituting a majority provision saying
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
that the winner has to have a majority
 
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution put that
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
provision in in place originally
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
originally the New Hampshire
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution demanded that Winners have
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
a majority 50% plus one
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
in other states the way they get to this
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
majority is through runoff elections
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
however we did not have runoff elections
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and instead we had a
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
provision in the Constitution that has
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
since been struck that said if we did
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
not have a majority the decision would
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
be made by the legislature and so what
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
happened is as people started to realize
 
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
that they could win through the
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
legislature if enough people were in the
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
race we had more and more elections that
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
didn't have majority winners and more
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
and more frequently and this is the late
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
1800s into the early 1900s more and more
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
frequently the legislature New Hampshire
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislature was deciding election
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
outcomes and so in 1912 I believe we
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
amended the Constitution to say just a
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
plurality just whoever happens to get
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
the most votes even if that's
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
12% so that's where we stand today right
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
now however other states that have this
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
majority provision that do the runoff
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
elections um they still do that so they
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
find a winner in those states that have
 
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.630 align:start position:0%
find a winner in those states that have
majority

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
support So rank Choice voting is another
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
way of getting at this and it's not
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
actually another way the other name for
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting is instant runoff
 
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
voting if you understand runoff
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
elections like they have in Georgia and
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
other states then you understand rank
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
Choice voting so just in case because we
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't have runoff elections in this
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
state in case you don't know when they
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
have a race in
 
00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
Georgia where they don't have have a
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
majority winner so they had more than
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
two people running no one got 50% plus
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
one what will happen is they will
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate everybody but the top two
 
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
candidates and they'll have an entirely
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
new election this actually happened for
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
both Senate seats this last election
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
cycle they'll have an entirely new
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
election at the expense of the
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayer now what if instead of holding
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
a whole new election which takes months
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
or at least a month and is at Great cost
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
to the to the people the taxpayer and at
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
Great cost to them having to turn out
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
what if we just said hey if this goes to
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
a runoff election who would you vote for
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what rank Choice voting is
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that so if you think
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
runoff elections are good and they help
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
determine majority outcomes it's the
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
same thing for rank Choice voting that
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
is literally instant runoff voting so
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
how it works is you as a voter put down
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
your preferences your first preference
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
if that person gets eliminated because
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
they got the least number of votes then
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
your next preference Etc and then we go
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
in runoff rounds so starting with the
 
00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:08.799 align:start position:0%
first round we count up the votes just
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
like normal if someone gets a majority
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's over done just like normal if no
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
one gets 50% plus one then the person
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
the candidate who get receives the least
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
number of votes is eliminated and all of
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
those ballots that chose that person as
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
their first preference get reallocated
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
to their next preference and then we do
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
an entirely new election a runoff round
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
so um one of the I guess uh talking
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
points of opposition tends to be well
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
isn't this just giving certain people
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
extra votes is a runoff election giving
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
people extra votes every single person
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
who voted in that election still is
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
voting so if you're if you're B didn't
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
get eliminated or that that first
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
preference didn't get eliminated you're
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
still voting for your first preference
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
but you're still voting in that runoff
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
round and in fact and we have a legal
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
expert that can talk about specific
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
cases but in fact this has gone before
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
the court quite a number of times uh on
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
the idea that it violated one person one
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
vote and every single time at every
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
single level of the Judiciary um rank
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
Choice voting was found not only to not
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
violate one person one vot but to
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
actually in some court cases they said
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
it strengthened one person one vote so
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
really briefly uh I want to talk about
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
this cool thing that we have as state
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
representatives in our district
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts because when you
 
01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
do rank Choice voting in a multi-member
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
district where you have more than one
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
person that has a seat so you have like
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
in many of our districts two seats three
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
seats you get a really cool effect
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
because not only are you eliminating
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
those wasted votes that are cast for
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
candidates that can't win and coalescing
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
the support from those candidates around
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
the one that most people support but
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
you're also eliminating uh the problem
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
of wasted votes for candidates who have
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
already won and the effect of that
 
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
because the the votes when your
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
candidate your preferred candidate's
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
already won you go to your next
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
preference and the effect of that is
 
01:01:20.559 --> 01:01:22.069 align:start position:0%
preference and the effect of that is
proportional

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
proportional
 
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
representation proportional
 
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
representation proportional
representation

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
is when the actual elected
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
body looks like the electorate and looks
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
like in terms of politically I don't
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
mean physically obviously so for example
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
right now we might have a district that
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
has three seats let's say the district
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
is 67%
 
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
Democrat and 33% Republican it has three
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
seats it's 67% Democrat ideally you
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
would want two of those seats to be
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
Democrat and one to be Republican repan
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
right because that would reflect the
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
body the electorate however what what
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
happens right now a single party sweep
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
if you have a district that's 67%
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
Democrat all three will go to the
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
Democrats leaving a third of that
 
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.710 align:start position:0%
Democrats leaving a third of that
district

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
unrepresented with proportional
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
representation that is is an outcome of
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting in a multi-member
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
district you end up with the two and one
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
usually it's not based on party but the
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
point is is that people's preferences
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
are taken into effect and taken into
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
account excuse
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
me so I'd like to talk about
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
implementation and I am kind of giving a
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
30,000 foot view I know I'm going
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
through details but I'm not delving into
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
the details that's why I have the
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
experts behind me so really briefly on
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
implementation one of the concerns that
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
I've heard is how does this affect Town
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
workers absolutely not at all if you are
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
a municipal worker in an election you do
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
not do anything differently ranked
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
Choice voting ballots are not counted
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
tabulated what have you on the town
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
level they can't be it wouldn't make any
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
sense in all of these elections you have
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
to take into you can't eliminate any
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
candidates until you know who got the
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
least number of votes overall so the way
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
implementation is done and this is how
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
implementation was done in Maine and we
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
do have people to speak to that is you
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
have to send neze all of the data from
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
all the ballots this can either mean uh
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
a secure Courier that cers um the actual
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
memory cards from the election machines
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
or a a secure Courier that couriers the
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
ballots themselves so even without
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
machines whatsoever we can Implement
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting this is what they do
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
in Maine Maine is a geographically
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
larger State than we are uh the furthest
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
if we're centralizing everything the
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
furthest you can get from conquered is
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
about 3 hours in this state maybe four
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about maybe a delay of
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
a of five or six hours on Election night
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of results but but not in terms
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the first runoff round reporting Town
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
workers can still report their first
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
runoff round numbers just like normal
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
those are not certified election results
 
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State rarely certifies
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
on the same night but they can report
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
what their numbers are they do not have
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
to run any round in fact they can't run
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
any rounds because it wouldn't make
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
sense so anyway the implementation does
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
nothing changes for the town worker they
 
01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
process the ballots as normal you have
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
couriers that either bring memory cards
 
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
or ballots to a central location
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
conquered the secretary state's office
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
takes over from there if they are
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
ballots they are run through a
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner that are rented for a
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
very very low cost Maine does this uh if
 
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
they are memory cards then they are
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
simply plugged in and through open-
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
Source software where everyone can see
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
how the software works the rounds are
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
run and everyone can see exactly which
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
votes went to
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
whom now if you're using memory cards
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
the question is do we have machines
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
compatible currently our our current
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
machines are not compatible however the
 
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is already
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
looking into machines we have the have a
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
funds to buy new machines as many of you
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
already know and every single machine on
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
the market today is rank Choice voting
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
compatible without so we have no dog in
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
the game in terms of which machine does
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
certify uh all of this
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
implementation um again they can speak
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
more in depth about this but it took
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
Maine a few months and low six figures
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
to implement so really really um kind of
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
low barrier to
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
implementation another question that
 
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
gets brought up a lot is voter education
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
and the voter
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
experience so this has been implemented
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
in I believe we're at 27 States on some
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
level Municipal level uh local elections
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
military State political parties we have
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
over half the country in terms of states
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
that do it on some level um we have exit
 
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
polls from those States voters
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly understand and are
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the process even in the
 
01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:24.670 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the process even in the
first

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
iteration of it and really um there is
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
there are voter education efforts just
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
to but it's mostly just to prepare them
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
for the idea of ranking like it's not
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
just one person you get to you get to
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
rank so the the the kind of myth that
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
voters get confused if you understand
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
how to rank your three favorite flavors
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
of ice cream then you understand how to
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
vote on a rank Choice voting ballot
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
three choices first first second third
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
simple as
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
that um it's one of those things that's
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
really easy to understand when you see
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
it and it's harder to explain verbally
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
um I know that you've heard testimony
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
that there's writing names on on ballots
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
or something like none of that is the
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
case it's still filling the bubble just
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
like our current ballots um and in fact
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
roughly half of our body um who was
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
previously skeptical by the way some
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
members were skeptical at the beginning
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
of this term about rank Choice voting
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
but the Democratic caucus elected their
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
leader for the first time using rank
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
Choice voting as I mentioned some of the
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
members were skeptical but we all went
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
through the process we when I used to be
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
a member and it took about 15 minutes or
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
so but only because um some of the
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
members were having computer
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
difficulties and everybody understood
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
the results it just it was very simple
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
we got to see the different rounds and
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
how the the votes got reallocated
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
and uh I think we made a lot of beli
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
Believers out of out of a lot of the
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
caucus just through that one experience
 
01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
having said that there will be
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
opportunities for you all I wish I could
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
do it here in testimony but to vote on
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
flavors of cookie or ice cream once you
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
do it you understand it um fairly
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
quickly in fact for those of you who
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
have been here when we've voted for
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
speaker when we had more than two people
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
running um the process is pretty similar
 
01:08:27.309 --> 01:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
only that we undergo several rounds of
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
voting instead of just putting our
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
preferences on one ballot but if you
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
have more than two people running for
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
speaker we as legislators and we vote
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
and nobody gets a majority usually what
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
happens is the person who got the fewest
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
votes drops out possibly endorses
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
another candidate and everybody votes
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
again that's exactly what happens with
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
rank Choice
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
voting so I mentioned that a bunch of
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
states do this on a local level
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
obviously main does it on on the
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide level AR excuse me Alaska
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
recently um adopted it for uh
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
primaries uh Minnesota California
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont New York Municipal
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
level the Virginia GOP recently adopted
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
it the Utah GOP has been using it for
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
well over a
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
decade it's used throughout the
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
English-speaking world including in
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
every election in Australia every
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
election in Ireland New Zealand Northern
 
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
Ireland and Scotland it is the voting
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
method not by name but by description
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
recommended by Robert's Rules of
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
Order and as such it's widely used in
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
corporations it's widely used by
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
universities um and it's actually used
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
by the Academy Awards I don't know how
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
you feel about the Academy Awards but uh
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's how we get best
 
01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.309 align:start position:0%
that's how we get best
picture

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
um that may not be a selling point
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
depending on what you
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
like so there's the point is this been
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
has been done for decades there's a ton
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
of data on how this works and if this
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
was a sky is falling situation as some
 
01:09:59.790 --> 01:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
people say you would you would know
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
about it you would know about it 27
 
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
States using it on all different levels
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
the military using it corporations
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
universities you would hear about how
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work but instead we're
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
hearing the opposite where more and more
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
people are adopting it because it does
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
work because it does allow people it
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
allows a number of things actually first
 
01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
of all it allows the voter to vote their
 
01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
conscience instead of feeling forced
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
into one or two parties and ultimately
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
I don't really like this person but at
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
least they're not that other person
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
instead of that kind of voting which
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
feels icky to me if that's a technical
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
word it feels negative and forced
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
instead of that it allows them to vote
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
their conscience without penalizing
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
their next
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
preference um and I think we can all
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
think of uh examples of Elections where
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we felt that way where we didn't
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
really like the person on our side but
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
the independent really didn't have a
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
shot so we voted for that person because
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
at least they weren't you know b elub or
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
whatever um it also allows third-party
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
candidates independent candidates
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
candidates that don't normally get a lot
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
of um airtime per se low dollar
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
candidates people with different ideas
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
it allows them all to compete on an even
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
playing field not in terms of
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
advertising and money but in terms of
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
recognition on the ballot and people
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
being allowed to vote for them without
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
penalizing their next preference it also
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
reduces um negative campaigning because
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
if you think about it you may be asking
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
a voter to vote for you as their first
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
preference but even if they tell you
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
that someone else is their first
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
preference you're not going to badmouth
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
their favorite preference because maybe
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
you can be their second preference or
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
their third even so in the places where
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
this has been instituted um negative
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
right and obviously and most importantly
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
it does uh help represent people it
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually GES gives us the most accurate
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
highdefinition picture of the will of
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
the electorate over any other system and
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
it is the only system where you can
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
actually basically through your voting
 
01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
say anybody but that person yes this
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
person my first and maybe these people
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
but definitely never that person there's
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
no other voting system there are a
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
number of alternative voting systems but
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
there's no other system that allows the
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
voter to do that so it increases
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
accurate representation and it also
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
increases voter engagement because in
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
some of these cases where people feel
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
like they're being forced into one of
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
two parties or the lesser of two evils
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
they feel like their vote doesn't matter
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
they feel like the only person I really
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
want is this independent candidate who
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any chance so why do I even
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
turn out out in this case they have a
 
01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
reason to turn
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
out um and like I said increases the
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
civility in in
 
01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
politics so um this
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
particular uh Bill allows for stepped
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
implementation so it is implemented in
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
stages so that at any point the
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
legislature can pull the plug if there's
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
any problems it uh starts implementation
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
in 2023 by allowing uh political parties
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
and municipalities the opin so parties
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to use it for their uh
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
primaries and municipalities would be
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
able to use it on the municipal level
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
then in 2025 it would go to Federal
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
elections those are the bigname
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
elections that people would really be
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
able to see uh how this plays out
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
certainly some party primaries it would
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
also be very publicized and people could
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
start seeing how people start to coales
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
around certain C candidates and then
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
2027 which is 5 years from now would be
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
it would be extended to all Statewide
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
elections so there's plenty of time to
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
put on the breaks if any of these uh
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
stages proves to be problematic and I
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
have spoken for quite a long time so
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
with that I will open up to any
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
questions but I do appreciate this
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
out thank you representative Reed
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members keeping
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
in mind that the people as to the
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
logistics of this implementation are yet
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
heard representative ter
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
roian thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question I
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
heard you say in your presentation that
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
under rank Choice voting it's still you
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
just vote get one vote but in reality if
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
you have a ballot with six people on it
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
you're actually voting six times with
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
different choices but you're still
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
voting six times right I it in I don't
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
know exactly what sentence you're
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
referring to I think I what I think you
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
might be referring to me saying it it
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
does not violate but in fact strengthens
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
one person one vote but what I did say
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
is it literally is as if you are going
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
through several State several different
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
elections so you are correct you are
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
voting every voter who casts a ballot is
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
voting each time in a different election
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
so you are voting six times but the
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
point is everybody in that election is
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
voting six times if there are six
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
rounds representative Alexander thank
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if you can answer it or
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
somebody behind you can um my question
 
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
is regarding voter like compliance I
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
guess with the system because if you
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
have like a large group of Voters like
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
maybe 30% of Voters that are like I hate
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting like I'm voting for
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
my candidate a and I'm not voting for
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
any other candidates because that's my
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
candidate so you're you're still not
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
going to get like like a majority
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
because that it doesn't get to the 50
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
plus is it 50% plus one on the first
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
round of ballots regardless of if
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
somebody chooses a second third fourth
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
fifth preference or can they choose the
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
same person each round of voting thank
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
you so much for the question it is a
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
really interesting question um so the
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
answer is yes while it is absolutely
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
true so no you cannot choose um the same
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
person for more than one preference if
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
your person hasn't been eliminated and
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
it goes to a second third round you're
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
still voting for your first preference
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
right because that person is still your
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
favorite um just as if you were to go to
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
a runoff election if the person you
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
voted for the first time is in the
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
runoff election you're still voting for
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
that person right so yes it's true that
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
a voter who for some reason is like oh
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
this rank Choice voting stuff is hooa um
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
they might only fill in their first
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
preference and that's it um especially
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
in the early stages the first couple
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
times but there's literally no reason to
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
do that strategically they are it is the
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
same as if they voted in the first
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
election and their candidate was
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
eliminated and then they chose not to
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
show up to the runoff
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
election if I could follow up thank you
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's just assuming that every
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
voter is a rational voter and they they
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure their preference is
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
noted in order but I'm asking the 5% of
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
Voters that might want to vote for just
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
that one person and their their person
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
is eliminated in the runoff so then what
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to have is out of the total
 
01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
majority of votes that 5% of vote base
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't pick somebody else and
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
their candidate was eliminated that's
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
still making it so there's no majority
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
on the first like after there's no
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
majority that makes sense the of the
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
original so every election is separate
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
so just as if you were to go to a second
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
runoff election and 5% of the electorate
 
01:17:46.510 --> 01:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
who voted in the first election didn't
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
show up that is their right to not show
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
up so they are choosing to not have a
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
voice in that second election um you're
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
right that some voters might do that we
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
call that bullet voting um and whereas
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
bullet voting is a legitimate strategy
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
in our current system there's absolutely
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
no strategic voting no reason to even
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
think about strategic voting in this
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
system and yes people might do that
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
initially because they're you know
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they feel negatively but I
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
think as time goes on second third they
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
realize there's no reason for me to
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
Bullet vote so yes you're right not
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's rational but it is just as
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
if each runoff round is a separate
 
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.189 align:start position:0%
if each runoff round is a separate
runoff

01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
runoff
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
election further questions from the
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
growan U representative Reed you my
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
understanding then is that uh no matter
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
how many candidates there
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
are the person ranks all those
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
candidates is that correct uh not if
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to um so my bill in
 
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
they don't want to um so my bill in
particular

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
let's say you have like a really wacky
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
District or a w wacky race where you've
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
got 17 30
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
candidates uh the studies that have been
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
done have shown that there's no
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
statistical difference after the 10th
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
ranking so mine is the number of
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
candidates if the candidates are like
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
three four five or 10 whichever is fewer
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
so you don't end up with these crazy
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
ballots with 17 columns or 30 columns
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
the most columns you'll ever have the
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
most rankings you'll ever ever have are
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
10 thank
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
qua thank you madam chairman and thank
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed for speaking
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
with us today if I understood correctly
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
a little while
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
ago uh you said that the uh calculations
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
required for this system of voting are
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
done by open soft open source software
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
and everyone can see how it works what
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
is your estimate of the percentage of
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
the population the voters and population
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
in general that's proficient enough at
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
reading computer code that they actually
 
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
can derive how it works from doing that
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
oh I I don't suppose very many people
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
are proficient at reading computer code
 
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
but that's that's not the point you can
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
literally see each ballot and of course
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's not identifiable to the voter but
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
you can see each ballot had a first
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
preference and a second preference the
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
ones that had this first preference when
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
that person was eliminated went to their
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
second preference and so on uh of course
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
open source they will be able to also
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
those who can read uh computer code will
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
be able to see that as well um but I
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
would say that even though that's only a
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
small number of the population literally
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
zero can understand how our current
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
machines work because those are literal
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
um proprietary black boxes no one's
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to see how those machines work
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
um except the company so even saying
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
okay we're opening up to everyone who
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
can read computer code is still a huge
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement over the situation we have
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
now where even experts who are
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
proficient at computer code don't know
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on inside the uh the the
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
voting machines we currently
 
01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative Reed I have one
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
and then I'm looking forward to moving
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
on to the people who have come in to
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
testify on this what's a wasted vote
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you a wasted vote is not to say
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
that a vote is like oh this person
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter we're throwing out that
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
vote their vote doesn't count it means
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
that the person voted for someone who
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
could not win so they could have voted
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
for someone who had the ability to win
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
but they voted for someone who ended up
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
with only 3% of the overall vote and if
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
you had given them the option and said
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay if you know that this candidate
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
will not be able to win who would you
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
pick they would pick somebody else and
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
everyone every single voter has that
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
same ability in in rank Choice voting so
 
01:21:56.229 --> 01:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's what a wasted vote is it just
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
means that their vote ended up not
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
influencing the outcome it means it
 
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.189 align:start position:0%
influencing the outcome it means it
doesn't

01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
win well because of not that it just
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't win but they didn't have a
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
win I understand but you're identifying
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
the need for rank Choice voting at least
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
in part because the current system has
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
wasted votes so given the current system
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
not rank Choice what is a wasted vote
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
right a wasted vote is a vote for a
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
candidate who had no potential to win
 
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
because all the votes ended up going
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me not all a significant enough
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
number of votes ended up going to one of
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
two candidates that the other candidates
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
did not influence the outcome does that
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
mean we are characterizing a certain
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of our population is simply
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
wasting their time at the polls no I'm
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
not trying to to C verion about them
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
wasting their time at the polls but I do
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
know many voters do feel like their vote
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter because no matter who
 
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
they want if they wanted some you know
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
other third party or an independent they
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
know that their candidate has no chance
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
of winning and so they get forced into
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
one of two parties reminds me of
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
discussions about when you're the last
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
kid picked for the team representative
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
Barry so I have a question about our uh
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
presidential primary which I guess this
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
would eventually apply to right indeed
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
so um the parties systems we don't need
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
to go into great detail of it but when
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
you go to vote for your first your pick
 
01:23:30.189 --> 01:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
for first in the nation you're selecting
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
delegates you're not actually voting for
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
the person you're voting for delegates
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
much like when you vote for president
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
elect you're vot picking electoral
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
electors to Electoral College um how
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
does that work now with with are we
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
creating a system where somebody's going
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
to come out of the New Hampshire primary
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
with all of the delegates because rank
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
Choice voting is going to get into 50%
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
or no no no no so each party it's 10%
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
for the Republic party and 15% am I
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
backwards I think I might be 10 okay
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
one's 10 one's 15 I thought but there is
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
a threshold uh above which the candidate
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
has to get in order to get any delegates
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
in their primary system so rank Choice
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
voting doesn't only work to get
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
candidates up to the 50% threshold it
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
can also work just to get candidates up
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
to the 15 or 10% threshold so you would
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
just run those runoff rounds until all
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
candidates remaining are above that
 
01:24:21.719 --> 01:24:25.149 align:start position:0%
candidates remaining are above that
threshold

01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
essentially you're coalescing support
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
amongst the people if you have 20
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
candidates you're asking them okay who
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
who do you support and if this person
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
cannot get above 10% who would you
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
support next until they have coalesced
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
all of their support behind candidates
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
who who reach over
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
10% there are people that are probably
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
better explaining this but that's that's
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
happen I mean I sort of started this by
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
asking another question because now I
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
want to say well aren't we talking about
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
a caucus so I'm going to stop does
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
anybody have any further questions for
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed and if not thank you
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
very much and I believe we talked about
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
uh Tian Coleman speaking
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
next and I believe that was the person
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
with the box is that
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.270 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.430 align:start position:0%
that
who

01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
all right who would you let I'm sorry
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to go in order of preference
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
next I'm sorry I ordered my pink cards
 
01:25:37.159 --> 01:25:38.910 align:start position:0%
next I'm sorry I ordered my pink cards
and

01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
her she needs two actually well that's
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
all right we can deal with that later
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:26:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
file

01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
who who needs that copy raise your
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
hand that other side do you have you
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
do we need to share some does everybody
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
we we're too short because we're going
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
to need one for the file too and we have
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%

so right okay all right for the file we
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%

welcome thank
 
01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you for having me today uh my
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
name is Tiani Coleman and yes I'm a
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
resident of Amherst New Hampshire and
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
I'm also president of New Hampshire rank
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
Choice voting as well as president of
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire independent
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
voters I also am an
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
attorney I uh am licensed here in New
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as in
 
01:27:57.550 --> 01:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
New York and I'm on inactive status in
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and as well as uh Utah so I
 
01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
not practicing very much law at the
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
moment but I am licensed here in New
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
anyway I sent this out to all of you
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
early this morning you all have it on
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
file have it in PDF as well as a link to
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
it on the web so it's a presentation I'm
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
not planning to go through all of this
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
right now that's not what this is about
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted you to be aware of it
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
because it very systematically explains
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
each thing and there's a table of
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
contents and so if there's a topic that
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
you have questions about or something
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
that you want to understand better it
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
explains it pretty well it's probably a
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
little bit better in the slide format
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
but you know hard copy still explains it
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
pretty well so I don't plan I didn't
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
really actually plan to come and talk
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
about each of these things I did want to
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of things the
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh this bill does not actually say
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere that doesn't use the word
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
majority it doesn't say anywhere that
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
somebody has to get a majority in order
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
to win it just talks about how you're
 
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
going to run all of the rounds until you
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
get a winner and you're going to
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate people if they haven't reached
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
the threshold
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
and in a in an election where you have a
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
single winner the threshold is 50%
 
01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
because it's the number 50% plus one
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
because it's the number where if someone
 
01:29:37.149 --> 01:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
reaches it nobody else has a chance to
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
win it's a mathematical impossibility
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
for anyone else to win if someone
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
reaches that threshold of 50% and so
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
what what the rank Choice voting really
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
is is it's saying we want to determine a
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
winner by going going through the full
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
rounds we want everyone to be able to
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
express their preferences and we want to
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
be able to go through all of the rounds
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
um but it's not necessarily someone said
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
oh well you're voting six times you're
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
actually not you're you're what you're
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
doing is you're expressing your
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
preferences in case if you need to go to
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of them just like if you send
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
someone to the ice cream store and you
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
say I really want you know pistachio ice
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
cream but a lot of stores don't have
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
pistachio and so when they go they say
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
well if they don't have pistachio what
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
do you want instead and you say well
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
then I want you know prings and cream
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
and they're like well if they don't have
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
that what do you want you're like well I
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
guess I'll have rocky road well if you
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't have that what do you want okay
 
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'll let's have vanilla you know but
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe you'll go there and but if
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
your favorite ice cream is vanilla then
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to always find
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to always find you
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
know vanilla at the ice cream store but
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
you still rank them because maybe they
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
run out of vanilla and you might want
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
chocolate so you rank them all just in
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
case if you need to use that ranking but
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
you may never fall back on that ranking
 
01:31:09.149 --> 01:31:09.159 align:start position:0%
so we have an example here in these
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
slides that show how it works but the
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
way it works is you know they count
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's first choice and if somebody
 
01:31:19.030 --> 01:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
gets that threshold of 50% after they
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
count all the first choices it's over
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
the election's over you don't have to
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
run any rounds you don't have to send
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
any ballots to the central counting
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
place it's over somebody already reached
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
the threshold no one else can win even
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
if you count all the rest of the rounds
 
01:31:35.229 --> 01:31:35.239 align:start position:0%
because someone already already won so
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
they can win on Election night you don't
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
even have to count them people just
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
Express their preference in case if it
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
was needed and so if you count all of
 
01:31:46.990 --> 01:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots that night and nobody gets
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
that preference then you say okay we're
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate the person in last
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
and those people were going to count
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
their second preference because their
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
candidates been eliminated but everyone
 
01:31:59.709 --> 01:31:59.719 align:start position:0%
else we're still going to count their
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
top preference and you just keep doing
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
that until someone reaches the threshold
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
now someone asked the question well what
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
happens if you know nobody gets a
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
majority because nobody you know because
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe 5% of the people chose not
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
to rank all their candidates because
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
it's true if every single person ranks
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
all of their candidates then you will
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
certainly always get a majority when you
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
use rank Choice voting if everybody
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
ranks all their candidates but if
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
everybody doesn't rank all of their
 
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
candidates well you probably will still
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
get a majority because usually the race
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
isn't quite that close that it comes
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
down to the last little percentage but
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
let's say it is that close well then
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
there are two different ways that you
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
can you can do it way is to say we
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
are going to go by everyone one that
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
voted on the first round and we're going
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
to and and you know so you just count
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
until either a someone reaches the
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
threshold or B all the ballots have been
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
exhausted and you know then maybe they
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
won't win by a majority but they still
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
you still were able to count everybody's
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
full preferences until the ballots were
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
exhausted now in some cases people
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
choose to do it in such a way that they
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
count it by you know by having the final
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
by counting each round separately and so
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
at the end they say okay well we're only
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
counting the people that voted in the
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
last round like a typical runoff and so
 
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a majority because you
 
01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:34.280 align:start position:0%
only have two people so there's two
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
different ways to do it but it doesn't
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
have to be any certain way just like
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
Ellen brought up in presidential
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
primaries you rank you use rank choice
 
01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.350 align:start position:0%
primaries you rank you use rank choice
of

01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
voting and you don't have to come to a
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
majority it's rank Choice voting is just
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
a way of expressing preferences it
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean majority it just means a
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
way of expressing preferences so you can
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
have you can use rank Choice voting in a
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and still only
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
count until you reach the threshold
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
which in the case of a presidential
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
primary the threshold is the 10% or the
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
15% so once all the candidates have that
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
much you don't count anymore because
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're trying to get to that
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
threshold and it's not about a majority
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
so there are different ways to do it you
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it the same way every
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
time um I I can't can talk about the
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issues if you have
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
questions um I wanted to point out a
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
couple of things because I know there
 
01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
are a couple of elephants in the room
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes so one thing I want everyone
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
to know is that I um I was introduced to
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting when I was chair of
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
the it wasn't the Utah GOP it was the
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
Salt Lake County Republican party I was
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
chair of that um this was two decades
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
ago actually it was in the early 2000s
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
and uh we used it in our conventions out
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
there and that's how I got to know it
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
and that's how I got to use it and I
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
liked it a lot and I am now an
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
independent and I have also run a
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
campaign before for a
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
Democrat um and in all of those cases I
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
I loved rank Choice voting when I was a
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
staunch DieHard chair of the County
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
Republican party total Republican I
 
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
loved rank Choice voting when I ran the
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
campaign for a Democrat a a candidate
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
for congress who was a Democrat I loved
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting and now I'm an
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
independent and I love rank Choice
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
voting it has nothing to do with what
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
party I belong to or you know what it
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with that because I
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
just know that it's the best the best
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
way of selecting a candidate which by
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
the way I want everyone to know that you
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
know in my capacity with president of
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rank chice voting it's a
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
complete volunteer position I don't get
 
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
paid this has I am not here at all
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
because I you know am getting paid to do
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
this or anything like that I I'm doing
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
this because it's something I care about
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
and something I think is very important
 
01:36:06.189 --> 01:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
and I think it will help help our
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
country be better and it's just a better
 
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
way to do elections um do I think that
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting is going to solve all
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
the problems in our country and it's
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly going to make everything just
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
perfect no it's not the the one all be
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
all and only only reform that we need
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
but it is definitely an easy reform that
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
we can Implement that will make a good
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
difference and it's good for everyone I
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
like to call it a non-partisan win-win
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
for everybody it can help every stripe
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
of person it can help the people that
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
are in the
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
establishment it can help the people who
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
are non-establishment it can help the
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
people who are in the major party it can
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
help the people that are in the minor
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
party help independent third parties it
 
01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
really helps everyone because it gives
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
everybody an equal voice and a More
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
Level Playing Field and it actually is
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
just a better system overall so that is
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
why I support rank Choice voting now I
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
know one of the other elephants in the
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
room that I never used to hear I was out
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
talking about rank Choice voting here in
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know I've lived here
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
now for almost nine years and I've been
 
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
talking about it to people almost that
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
long um and I used to just talk to
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
people and they were all excited didn't
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
matter if they were republican or
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
democrat or who they were they were
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
really excited about it but
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
after Paul Quinn lost all of a sudden I
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
started hearing a lot of people saying
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
oh that's that's a rigged that's that's
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's a horrible horrible thing we we
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
should not do that because somehow
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
people thought well this is that you
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
know that's just some liberal Democratic
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
ploy to try to you know take over or
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
something I'm thinking are you kidding
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
me like I've been in favor of rank
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
choy's voting since forever and I got
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
introduced to it when I was a Republican
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to point out that in
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
Maine and it's in these slides you can
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
see it but there are different scenarios
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
that can help it happen in a rank Choice
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
race I already mentioned one of them you
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
can have someone win on the very first
 
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
ballot when they count everyone's first
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
choice and they get that 50% threshold
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they are the winner and it's exactly
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
like it it is now no different you can
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a race where somebody is ahead in
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
the very first ballot and they have 35%
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the vote this so they don't have the
 
01:38:27.550 --> 01:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
threshold so you run the rounds but
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
after you run all the rounds and you're
 
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
done that person who had 35% of the vote
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
still wins by the end so the person that
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
started with 35 ends up getting past the
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
50% threshold and they win when they're
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
done they stayed ahead the whole time or
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they fell behind for a minute and
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
then pulled back up whatever happened
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
but they won so that can happen and then
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
you can have the case like the golden
 
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
and the poliquin race where it was very
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
close the whole
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
time and so yes Paul Quinn was ahead in
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
the first round and yes he did end up
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
losing because there were two other
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
independent candidates who were pretty
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
strong for independent candidates and
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
their second
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
Preference they they preferred golden
 
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
over poin and something kind of
 
01:39:19.310 --> 01:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
interesting that I found sorry I'm
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
looking over there I should look at all
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
of you
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
um something kind of interesting that I
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
found was that I was out actually kind
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
of promoting rank Choice voting at a
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
poll and there was someone that was
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
going to that someone that was actually
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
running in that election and they didn't
 
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily support rank shows voting
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
but they came up to me and they said you
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
know what I want to tell you I want to
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
admit to you that I really think that
 
01:39:48.709 --> 01:39:48.719 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't that what happened in
 
01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:51.159 align:start position:0%
Maine was not a rigged election I'm I
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
know what happened I know that they told
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
everyone to only express one preference
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
and I also know that Paquin wasn't out
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
trying to earn the vote of those
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
Independents he wasn't out trying to get
 
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
them to vote for him he he should have
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
he should have been appealing more to
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
The Independents so that when they got
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
knocked out of the race they would have
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to vote for him and support him
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
but he didn't campaign to them and
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
golden did but what I want all of you to
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
know is that that could have been
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
completely the opposite it could could
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
have been it could have been golden who
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
started out ahead and Paquin who pulled
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of golden and that could happen in
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of races and so the point isn't
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
that rank Choice voting H helps any
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
certain kind of candidate it doesn't it
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't help any certain kind of
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
candidate the kind of candidate it helps
 
01:40:42.589 --> 01:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
is the candidate who can get the most
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
support and isn't that what we want from
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
elections we want to elect the people
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
who have the most support we don't want
 
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
want people to win by
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
fluke um one of the examples I have in
 
01:40:58.030 --> 01:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
here is the Fall River Race in Fall
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
River Massachusetts I don't know if you
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
heard about it but there was a mayor
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
running and he was indicted for tax
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
fraud I believe it was he was under
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
indictment and so they had a recall
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
election and 61% of the voters I believe
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's close to that I think that was what
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
is they voted to recall him they didn't
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
want him and it was one of those
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
elections where on the same ballot as
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
the recall they also elected who the new
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
mayor would be if he was recalled so he
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
was recalled and on that same ballot
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
people voted for who they wanted and
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
they had him as one of the names on the
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
ballot and so everyone voted again and
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
65% of the voters voted for someone else
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
they didn't want
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
him but 35 or 3 35 I think it was voted
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
for him
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
again right but the other but the people
 
01:41:54.589 --> 01:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
who voted against him they all split
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
their votes between four or five other
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
candidates and so the other candidates
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
got a small percentage of the vote and
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
kareah was elected again to be the mayor
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
he had just been recalled and he was
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%
elected back in rank Choice voting would
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
have never allowed that to happen it
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
would have never happened with rank
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
Choice voting because we knew that 65%
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the voters did not want him and they
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
would have gotten a much better result
 
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
had they used rank Choice voting in that
 
01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.470 align:start position:0%
had they used rank Choice voting in that
election

01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the way things would happen
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
in a lot of different races and so I
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
think you know people should really give
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
give it a real look give it you know pay
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
attention to it because it's something
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
that really is good for
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
everybody and I think that you would you
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
would like it so if anyone has any
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
questions for me um I I do have a whole
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
section here on on the Constitutional
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
issues if you want to look at them
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
um for sure you know I will say that
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting has been brought
 
01:42:55.149 --> 01:42:55.159 align:start position:0%
before federal courts on article one on
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
the equal protection clause which is the
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
one person one vote on due process and
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
free speech on the Voting Rights Act and
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's been upheld every single time and
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's been clearly upheld it's been
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
upheld unan unanimously in many
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
occasions it's it's it's really not even
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
a question when it comes to the US
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and is definitely
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional so you know when it comes
 
01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:17.719 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Constitution there
 
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
are some issues that are a little more
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
complicated and even though
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
come out I think I think in favor of
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting and I have in here
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
the citation to a uh recent article that
 
01:43:31.870 --> 01:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
just came out La review article that
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
just came out in October from two
 
01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:36.679 align:start position:0%
professors of uh
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
NYU who have studied that plurality
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
provision very extensively and they they
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
make their case very strongly that you
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
know rank Choice voting is still
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional under the plurality
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
provision if anyone's aware of what I'm
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
going talking about but
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
um but even so you know the plurality
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
provision is is in the Constitution and
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
it only applies to the race for a
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
governor for state senate for house
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
because it mentions it although if you
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
were to use it for proportional RCV I'm
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
not sure it would matter anyway um and
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
for um executive counsel and anyway I
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
think there's a really strong case that
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
rank Choice V if you have any more
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
questions I'll talk more about that but
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
that and thank you you did all get an
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
email which has a link to this handout
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
that you have which within it has got
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
links to videos and other information
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative prudom Brian
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chairman um
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
the Fall River case is interesting to me
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like those were very loyal
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
supporters of of that mayor who was uh
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
recalled now if there were rank Choice
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
voting couldn't they vote for that mayor
 
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh the recalled mayor for their second
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
choice as well and we that would be the
 
01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:05.390 align:start position:0%
choice as well and we that would be the
same

01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
situation they could vote for that same
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
person as their second choice is that is
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
that right no uh no you can only vote
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
for one person for each choice you
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
cannot vote for the same person for more
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
than one choice it's like if you go if
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
you go to an election
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
and you vote and then they're going to
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
have a runoff if your candidate didn't
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
make it into the runoff you can't vote
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
for them because they're out they're not
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not in anymore um
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
but you know if they're in then yeah you
 
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
can vote for if you if you vote for them
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
and they stay in then in rank Choice
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
voting your vote will always count for
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
the person who if that you voted for if
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
they're still in your vote will always
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
count for them but if they're out then
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
you can't I have a followup follow up
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so if the person did vote in
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
that manner would that be a a vote that
 
01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:55.229 align:start position:0%
that manner would that be a a vote that
was

01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
was not counted because it would be hard
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
to understand what the voter's intent
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
was would the would the ballot just be
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
tossed out on that on that race well I
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
mean it would it' be like if you go to a
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
runoff election and you vote for someone
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
who's not on the ballot they're they're
 
01:46:13.709 --> 01:46:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to toss it they're not going to
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
count I mean I mean you can do a write
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
in and you can do a write in on ring
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
Choice voting as
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
well but uh
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh but um yeah so I mean you wouldn't
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't vote for someone that's
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
been eliminated that they're bought him
 
01:46:31.229 --> 01:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
now kareah in this case he was the
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
winner and so you know
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
what uh if you made him a second
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
choice that wouldn't have worked because
 
01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't have been the first person
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
eliminated he was up near the top he
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
would have been one of the very last
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
people eliminated probably would have
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
been you know he would have made it to
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
the final two in that case people that
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
are eliminated are the people that are
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
getting 5% % of the vote 3% of the vote
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
10% of the vote not the people that are
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
getting 35% of the vote they're usually
 
01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
going to make it to the last round
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
usually thank you further questions from
 
01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
usually thank you further questions from
the

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
committee oh I'm sorry representative
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you madam chair I guess I
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
would like you to speak to the New
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the plurality
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
issue because it has come up when we
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
reviewed these bills okay uh the
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
previous session and just to address
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
that I know it's in here but sure for
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
the people listening so if you just want
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
to turn to it real quick um basically
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
the point on the plurality provision is
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
that um there's a few different points
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
about it but if you look at it first it
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
shows here what it applies to I've
 
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
already said that though so um it only
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
applies to certain
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
races and what it says is that the
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
person elected it just says it just says
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
in a little line it says the person
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
elected will be elected by a plurality
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:48:00.669 --> 01:48:00.679 align:start position:0%
vote um and so then the question is what
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
does plurality mean what does that mean
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
when you say that someone is elected by
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
a plurality of the vote and if you look
 
01:48:11.229 --> 01:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
up the word plurality that means whoever
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
had the most votes right so some people
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
say well you know it means you know I
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
mean yes in the in the New Hampshire con
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
ution like like representative Reed said
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
that it used to say that people had to
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
win by majority the
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
vote and they also said that the
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislators would be um the legislators
 
01:48:36.669 --> 01:48:36.679 align:start position:0%
would get to pick the candidate so if
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
you go back and you read what they were
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
saying when they made that change to the
 
01:48:41.950 --> 01:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution and and turned it into that
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
you could win by a plurality of the vote
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
the whole reason why they did it was
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want the legislature
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
to make the decision it's not because
 
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't want majority to decide it
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
was obvious that they wanted the
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
majority to decide but it was causing so
 
01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:55.550 align:start position:0%
majority to decide but it was causing so
many

01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
problems that they they didn't want the
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
legislature to keep making that decision
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
because then it became a very
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body was very political and
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
they had too much power they didn't want
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
that and so they changed it um and so
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
they so what they were saying was we're
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
not going to have a restriction that
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
someone can't win with a
 
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
plurality but rank Choice voting like I
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
said doesn't doesn't create that
 
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
restriction either either there is a
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
scenario it is technically possible
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
depending on how you decide to run it
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
but there is a a a scenario where
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
someone could win with less than a
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
majority and nowhere in the bill does it
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
say someone has to have a majority
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't really say that and like I said
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
it might say yes the threshold is 50%
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
but that's based on the the fact that
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
once someone reaches 50% it's
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
mathematically impossible for anyone
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
else to win um but also as as it was as
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
these people are saying that I linked
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
their their law review article they have
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
gone through you know every single state
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of States they might not use
 
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
the word plurality but they still say
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
the person with the most votes wins and
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's really what it's kind of
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
talking about and there are three terms
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
in which in which plurality is used
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it says the plurality the you
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
have to win by plurality of the vote
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
meaning you have to have the most votes
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
there's also the term that is um
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
plurality winner plurality winners or um
 
01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
plurality winner plurality winners or um
plurality

01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
plurality
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
systems and that's not necessarily the
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
same thing these terms keep getting used
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
and so even I mean I even hear people
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
say it and it makes me cringe because
 
01:50:39.629 --> 01:50:39.639 align:start position:0%
people inter they they use these terms
 
01:50:41.709 --> 01:50:41.719 align:start position:0%
and they intermix them but they don't
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
always mean the exact same thing for
 
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
example if someone wins with the
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
plurality of the vote mean or not a
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
plurality of the vote but if someone
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
wins with just a plurality
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
percentage you know that then yes if
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
someone WS at a plurality percentage
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
that definitely means they won with less
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
than 50% of the vote but you know we
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
have elections all the time where people
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
win with 50% of the vote and that
 
01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you know it's
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional like obviously you're
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get someone that wins with 50%
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
of the vote um so it's not you know
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
these terms get used in different ways
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
um now in the bill it does specifically
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
say that you know rank Choice voting is
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
the method by which a plurality will be
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
determined and um and also you know it's
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
the idea that in the rank chose election
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's one ballot everyone goes and
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
everyone votes on one ballot they're not
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
voting on you know multiple BS yes they
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
are expressing their
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
preferences but all of those preferences
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be counted if your if
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
your person's still in the race or if
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
someone wins on the first round and all
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
that it's just one ballot it's one vote
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
vote it's one
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
election and so you're just saying look
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be at the end of the
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
election till we finish counting the
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
rounds or or someone's already reached
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
the threshold and become the winner and
 
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
so it's similar to saying oh we're going
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
to declare the winner you know before
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
you've counted all the precincts half
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
the precincts have come in and we
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
counted them and they have the most
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
votes and so they won because they have
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
the most votes it's like wait a minute
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
finish the election finish counting all
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
the other precincts
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is this is we're
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
saying wait a minute you can't declare
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
the winner after the first round you
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
have to finish the election this is a
 
01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
rank Choice election you have to finish
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
it but that doesn't mean it violates the
 
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
plurality provision now yes we all maybe
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
we don't all know but some some of you
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
know that the Maine Supreme Court did
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
have a an advisory opinion where Maine
 
01:52:45.149 --> 01:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
had a similar provision and yes the main
 
01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court did say in their advisory
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that they thought that that was
 
01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional now um that was an
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
advisory opinion it was never decided on
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
the merits the the people from Maine
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
decided to just drop those races because
 
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
you know they had they had an election
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
to win and they just didn't want to be
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with all that so when they they
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
dropped their state races so in Maine
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
they elect they use rank Choice voting
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
for all of their primaries they use it
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
for their Federal elections meaning
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
their elections for governor
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
and US Senate and US Congress and
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
President they use it for those because
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
those are under the Federal Constitution
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no problem up there but they
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't use it in their general elections
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
for governor even though they want to
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
but that's not because that's not
 
01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
because it was declared unconstitutional
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
because it was not a final opinion it
 
01:53:41.550 --> 01:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
was just an advisory but they chose to
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
take it off of their ballot measure they
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
chose to take it off of their ballot
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
measure just to not deal with just so
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to deal with it
 
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
um but nonetheless main opinions are not
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
binding on us anyway so that advisory
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
opinion is not actually binding
 
01:53:58.830 --> 01:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
precedent on Maine and it's certainly
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
not binding precedent on
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.189 --> 01:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
the I'm going to ask that answers really
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
be directed specifically to the
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
questions and I'm going to ask members
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
to ask please specific questions I
 
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
apologize for my scheduling and and
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
maybe I the sponsor spoke for very long
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
time on this but we have people who um
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
are here to speak and I and I want to
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
try and make sure that we're getting to
 
01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:29.239 align:start position:0%
specific points um because I think we
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
handled the concept initially so are
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
there other questions for this
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
witness representative Barry um so I'm
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you brought up the main um
 
01:54:44.589 --> 01:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
unanimous decision or advisory opinion
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that the language in
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
the main Constitution is identical to
 
01:54:50.189 --> 01:54:50.199 align:start position:0%
the language in the the New Hampshire
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
state constitution a by a plurality of
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
votes it's literally the same language
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
same language it's not um it's not
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing but yes it's very
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
similar yes it is and and like I said
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
there is that law review article where
 
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
they go through every single state and
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
all all of the legislative histories and
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
everything else and they do come out
 
01:55:13.470 --> 01:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
with the conclusion that Maine was wrong
 
01:55:15.629 --> 01:55:15.639 align:start position:0%
and I agree with them at least I I think
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
they should be wrong but yes it is it is
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
an issue I'm not saying you know it's
 
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
not a slam dunk like the US Constitution
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution is a slam dunk
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
people who say that rank Choice voting
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
violates the US Constitution I'm sorry I
 
01:55:29.310 --> 01:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
I think they're wrong because way too
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
many decisions have been made that said
 
01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
it does not on this case there are no op
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
well actually there is a Massachusetts
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
opinion that I cite in here where they
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
said it's fine but it is slightly
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
different but it's it's pretty similar
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and they say it's fine um but in Maine
 
01:55:48.270 --> 01:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
like I said it's not a binding decision
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the truth is is the courts have hav
 
01:55:52.109 --> 01:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
haven't toed on it there are a lot of
 
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
really good attorneys who think it
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
really should have been const that it is
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional and that main made the
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
wrong decision but I can't
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee that some Court wouldn't say
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
that it's unconstitutional I don't think
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
it should be I think the legislative
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
intent would clearly if the people here
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the legisl the people that made that
 
01:56:12.669 --> 01:56:12.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that changed it to plurality
 
01:56:14.109 --> 01:56:14.119 align:start position:0%
if they discovered rank Choice voting
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
they'd be like oh boom that's exactly
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
what we should be doing I think because
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they wanted but you know
 
01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.069 align:start position:0%
that's what they wanted but you know
further

01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative ter Roan thank
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
you madam speaker thank you man for
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
taking the question so to just follow up
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not a foregone conclusion
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
that our Supreme Court would would not
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
vote differently than what Maine did we
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that answer would that be
 
01:56:44.350 --> 01:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
correct we don't know positively no we
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't um but also that like Mr Reed said
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know you know this bill does have
 
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
the implementation in such a way that it
 
01:56:56.669 --> 01:56:56.679 align:start position:0%
won't that provision will not affect
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
this bill clear until 2027 that's a
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
really long time and it's time to sort
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
it out and figure it out um and it it
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect the other bill but we
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
won't talk about that but it wouldn't
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%

before when we were so let's I that's
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
what I thought so so what does it look
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
like it is mostly black and white with a
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of blue on the bottom with
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%

01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
definitely aware um given the last two
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh presentations main recently
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
instituted rank Choice voting for a
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
number of our elections all primary
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
elections general elections for federal
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
Offices and some Municipal level
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
elections due to a Supreme Judicial
 
01:59:38.069 --> 01:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
Court advisory opinion um that was
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
issued shortly after RCV first became
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
law it is not used for gubernatorial or
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislative general elections at this
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
time we first passed RCV through a
 
01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:50.679 align:start position:0%
citizen initiative process requiring a
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide vote in 2016 Main voters again
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
then stated their preference for RCV in
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
another Statewide vote in 2018 when at
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
the same time they were using RCV for
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
the first time we have found in the
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
years since that voters appreciate the
 
02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
option to rank their candidates on their
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
ballots and that they found it easy to
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
vote in this manner after all we rank
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
our choices on all sorts of things every
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
day what we'll be making for dinner for
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
our families uh what music to put on on
 
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
the radio what to watch on where to go
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
on vacation what to put on TV um so
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
implementing that same decision-making
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
process for voting uh was not very
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
difficult we also feel that voters
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the option to vote their
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
heart on their ballots rather than
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
having to stress and worry that voting
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
for their favorite candidate in a
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
plurality election may end up helping
 
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
their least favorite candidate win voter
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
frustration that plal voting doesn't
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
always reflect the will of the majority
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh who may be split between two similar
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
candidates who advance to the general
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
election is one of the reasons that main
 
02:01:00.390 --> 02:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
voters chose
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
RCV voters should feel and know that
 
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
their vote matters and that the
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
elections they participate in results in
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
representation that mirrors the
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
electorate on the election
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
Administration side uh we have not found
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
undue difficulty in conducting elections
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
voter education and instructions on
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
ballot markings are always part of any
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
election uh that's still the case with
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
RCV it's just that the instructions and
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
the educations themselves are new um I
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
know the Secretary of State's office um
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
when we were first implementing this
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
worked with nonprofits um the committee
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
on rank Choice voting and the
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan League of Women Voters of
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
Maine to conduct uh more extensive voter
 
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
education than is typically done ahead
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
of an election um but those groups work
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
together and in a very
 
02:01:52.950 --> 02:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan uh way to educate voters
 
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
about how they would be what they'd be
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
seeing on their ballots and how they'd
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
be marking them um as with any election
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
being upfront and honest with voters
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
about when they can expect to hear
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
results um perhaps it's a few days after
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
election day rather than on Election
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
night as they might be used to is a
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
vital part of voter confidence in
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
elections should New Hampshire choose to
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
go the route of rank Choice voting um
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
our elections division staff would be
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
more than happy to provide assistance
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
and guidance on best practices and
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
things we've learned to help with a
 
02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:25.510 align:start position:0%
things we've learned to help with a
smooth

02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
smooth
 
02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
implementation and uh thank you for the
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here and I'd be happy
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative ter roian thank you madam
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you deputy secretary for
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question we've heard
 
02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
testimony today that um rank Choice
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
voting can often help third party
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
candidates since you've had it in um use
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
has M voted in more third party
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
before I don't have the data in front of
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
me I know our legislature has a number
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
of unenrolled um or and a couple Third
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
Party U members but again our
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislature general elections don't use
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
um rank Choice voting so that that isn't
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't have an impact there I'd
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
be happy to get you any any numbers I
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
don't think think for the N the for the
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
elections that we have used it
 
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
for we have not seen unenrolled or third
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
party candidates win in those elections
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
yet but it's only been a few Cycles
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
followup um so a followup question would
 
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
be so if that's not the case
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
um has it more than one time flipped um
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
one party that would have won Under the
 
02:03:48.510 --> 02:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
plur plurality um wi after you went
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
through it second or third
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
round yeah so I think it's good to be
 
02:03:55.470 --> 02:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
cautious on trying
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
to figure out what would have happened
 
02:03:59.870 --> 02:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
in any given election under different
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
voting roles um we have seen in that
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
first um second congressional district
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
race that the results were
 
02:04:10.430 --> 02:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
flipped or not that they were flipped
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
but that someone who was not the leading
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
candidate in the first round ended up
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
being the winning candidate in the end
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what voters would
 
02:04:20.589 --> 02:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
have done under a different electoral
 
02:04:20.599 --> 02:04:22.830 align:start position:0%
have done under a different electoral
system

02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
um you just can't run a hypothetical in
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
that way because I think each side would
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
argue that their candidate would have
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
won any election that's that's typically
 
02:04:35.709 --> 02:04:35.719 align:start position:0%
what happens we all want we all would do
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Barry what
 
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
was the precipice for Maine going with
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
this system it it wasn't just organic
 
02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
somebody thought of this there was a
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
trigger what what what caused it what
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
was the what was the reason why they
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
broke you know two nearly 200 years of
 
02:04:55.149 --> 02:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
of the same system what caused it yeah
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
so um different bills for rank Choice
 
02:04:59.709 --> 02:04:59.719 align:start position:0%
voting uh were introduced in the
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
legislature between 2001 and
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
2013 um and were repeatedly uh voted
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
down so in 20 you say 2013 between 2001
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
and 2013 um it had been introduced a
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
number of times um and like I said
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
didn't pass so in 2014 proponents um led
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
by the committee on rank Choice voting
 
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
started Gathering signatures under our
 
02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:24.990 align:start position:0%
started Gathering signatures under our
citizen

02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
initiative um constitutional provision
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
to bring it to the voters themselves and
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
that was that process was the trigger to
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh get it first passed into law follow
 
02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
up um what is the um what is the ease of
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
access for third party or independent
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
candidates what's the ballot access
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
Provisions for non- major party
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
candidates in
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
main so if you want to run
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
our our party access numbers are the
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
same uh we have signature requirements
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
of different numbers for each uh
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
depending on the office that you're
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
running for 25 signatures for a house
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
race um couple thousand for
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
um Governor um and then unenrolled
 
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
candidates uh have double the number of
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
signatures but a longer amount of time
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
um since they are not running in a
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
primary further questions representative
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
growan thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
you uh Miss cook for taking my question
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh we heard testimony earlier that the
 
02:06:35.229 --> 02:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
implementation of this cost Main in the
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
low six figures I believe it was
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
um that seems very low to me uh how how
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
do you implement this in Maine and uh
 
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
and you know it's done I assume it's
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
done at the Secretary of State's office
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
how do you implement it yeah so um I I
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
looked up the numbers sadly after ID
 
02:07:00.549 --> 02:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
already printed off my testimony but I'd
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to um send them to you all so
 
02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
you can review we already have
 
02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
tabulators for most of our towns um some
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
of them are still hand count towns we
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't think a municipality with five
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
voters um is incapable of counting those
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
five votes accurately themselves um so
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
that was not a cost that we needed to
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
incur um so our startup costs um
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
29231 for a highspeed tabulator software
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
upgrades and some
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
computers in the June 2018 primary for
 
02:07:38.910 --> 02:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
Courier Services tabulator and software
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
use 72,2 200 same number for our
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
November 2018 General the July 2020
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
primary Ary um for the same Career
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
Services tabulator in use was 67
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
67,800 and the November 2020 General um
 
02:08:02.549 --> 02:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
no longer needed Courier Service um so
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
that was 38,000 for the tabulator and
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
software use so for each of those bullet
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
points uh we're in the tens of
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
thousands further questions
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative growan so the in your
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
case the the votes come in
 
02:08:25.229 --> 02:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
um do do paper ballots come into the
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and then and then you
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
comp them in a high-s speed tabulator
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry I forgot to um address the
 
02:08:34.549 --> 02:08:34.559 align:start position:0%
second part of your question so for the
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
towns that have a tabulator those uh
 
02:08:39.990 --> 02:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
memory sticks come to Augusta for the
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
towns that are hand count the um paper
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
ballots come in and we run them through
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the highspeed tabulator um and then run
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
the rankings from from there so sounds
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
like it would have been similar from
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
what I heard earlier the first rankings
 
02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.599 align:start position:0%
are counted at the Town level um just
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
like every election if it needs to go to
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
a rank Choice that's when the ballots
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
come to ballots or the memory sticks
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
come to
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
Augusta thank you further
 
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions question from the chair how
 
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
many polling places does Main have that
 
02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
are involved in the elections that use
 
02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
the right choice voting uh so we have
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
500 or so municipalities um and our
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide elections are all and federal
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
elections are all municipally run so we
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
have 500 different dat points
 
02:09:28.030 --> 02:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities yeah
 
02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
okay further
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative ter Roan thank
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thanks again for taking
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
the question since you implemented rank
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
Choice voting what's the timetable from
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
when the close of the election to when
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
you get your
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
results I believe they've all been run
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
within that that same week um like I
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
think someone said me's a large State
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
especially for New England um so getting
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
those memory sticks and ballots securely
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
to Augusta with the um chain of custody
 
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
is is important and taking the time to
 
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
do that right um but also do it
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
efficiently for a rank choice tabulation
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
for a legislative primary I think we've
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
run those maybe on the Thursday I
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
believe and I I'll double check on that
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
I think it was on a Friday for um the
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
Congressional one but again I can get
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
that to you further questions
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative prud home
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you madam chair so you say
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
the results come in in that same week
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
what was it prior to rank Choice voting
 
02:10:40.549 --> 02:10:40.559 align:start position:0%
when were the results out uh we count uh
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to count the
 
02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:44.599 align:start position:0%
ballots on Election night um and then
 
02:10:46.350 --> 02:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
they have two days to report their
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
results to the Secretary of State's
 
02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:49.069 align:start position:0%
results to the Secretary of State's
office

02:10:49.069 --> 02:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
office
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
um so I think most of the results are
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
pretty publicly available on Election
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
night um but depending
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
on not everyone transmits their results
 
02:11:02.669 --> 02:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
to us that night they have the next day
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
or the day after and the Press isn't
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
always in the the towns with only 100
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
voters to to get those numbers out to
 
02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
their readers follow Madam chair so my
 
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for being here I
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
didn't say that at first
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
but what you're saying then is that with
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
rank when rank Choice voting was
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
implemented in your state the amount of
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
time was extended there's it took longer
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
to get the results in for the for the
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
you know the people of the community to
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
know what the results were it took
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
longer and would that
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
be uh you said it went from two days to
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
the same week so is that up to five days
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
longer it's
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
taking I think to get the full results
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
if there isn't um someone with a a
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
majority in that first round it can take
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
a little longer but the same thing
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
happens if there's the need for a
 
02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
recount um you don't know what the
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
result so we have up to five days for
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
someone to request a recount so if you
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
have a really close election and
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
someone's deciding whether or not to
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
request a recount you wouldn't have the
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
final results of that election either
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
for a few days so it's kind of comes out
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the wash I have a followup Madam
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
follow a follow thank thank you a
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
recount is totally different a recount
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
is not the same as what generally is
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
happening in community so uh in general
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
for those 500 different municipalities
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
the length of time has been extended
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
forget about recounts that's a different
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
issue so is that correct for me to say
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
to me to think that this would extend
 
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
the time that the results come in am I
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
correct in
 
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
that uh so the initial results still
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to come into US within two days and
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we're going and getting the
 
02:12:54.669 --> 02:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
ballots or having them couriered to
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
Augusta um our legislators aren't sworn
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
in until December and members of or
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
members of Congress aren't sworn in
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
until January so there is time to make
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we get that right and that the
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
will of the voters is is accurately
 
02:13:13.229 --> 02:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
documented thank you representative
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you madam chair and thank you
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
for coming from Augusta um following up
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
on um the previous uh Representatives
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions was there any sufficient
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
backlash or brewhaha because the
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
elections got delayed a few days
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
um I think we um were the center of
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
attention because we were one of the um
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
outstanding races um especially in 2018
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh which was fun um The Secret secary at
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
that time and his
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
staff did a Facebook live which then in
 
02:13:56.189 --> 02:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
2018 was new and different for everyone
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
um showing the running of the
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
tabulation um which I think helped
 
02:14:02.109 --> 02:14:02.119 align:start position:0%
voters understand really what was
 
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
happening because they could from
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
wherever they were around the state um
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
watch what was going on in Augusta to to
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions all right I'm not seeing any
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%

02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%

those out right yeah those those those
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%

right there's one that looks like this
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%

that starts off representative Barbara
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
Griff and that looks like this that
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
right they're both three pages and I'm
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
going to uh
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
dwell mostly on mine but there is some
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
data on the second page which you might
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
be interested in and uh I'd like to
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
introduce myself by
 
02:15:33.629 --> 02:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
saying uh I live in Portland
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
Maine uh and I have been an advocate and
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
researcher for rank Choice voting for 10
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
years and thank you for all the
 
02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
questions that you have addressed to all
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
the other people who've testified I
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
actually have direct answers to almost
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
all of them if I had the time I would uh
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
address them but I I did want to before
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
I get into my stuff I wanted to make one
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
point that was said earlier and address
 
02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
the question from over here which is
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
what has been the effect of rank Choice
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
voting in terms of Elections
 
02:16:21.629 --> 02:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
um Tiana made the point that rank Choice
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
voting is good for all
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
parties whether Democrat
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
Republican or independent green
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
libertarian or whatever and that is
 
02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
true and I'd like to explain why it's
 
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
true because one of the biggest
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
criticisms in
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
Maine was from Democrats and Republicans
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
that rank Choice voting would be bad for
 
02:16:57.790 --> 02:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
their parties it would in fact create
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
more interest in other
 
02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:01.629 align:start position:0%
more interest in other
parties

02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
parties
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
so the reason that that's not true that
 
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
that criticism is not true is the
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
following when you have rank Choice
 
02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:11.669 align:start position:0%
following when you have rank Choice
voting

02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
elections nine out of 10 times and this
 
02:17:20.509 --> 02:17:20.519 align:start position:0%
is all over the world nine out of 10
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
times the person who gets the most votes
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
round wins the election
 
02:17:34.349 --> 02:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately right we're not talking about
 
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
the times when the person gets more than
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
50% throw those aside we're talking
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
about the elections where it goes into
 
02:17:42.639 --> 02:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
about the elections where it goes into
another

02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
round nine out of 10 times the person
 
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
who gets the most votes whether they are
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democrat and they're
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
always Republican Or
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
democrats nine out of 10 times they win
 
02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:02.629 align:start position:0%
democrats nine out of 10 times they win
the

02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
election so why do you have rank Choice
 
02:18:07.469 --> 02:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
voting well think about it the reason
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's good for the Republicans and
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
Democrats is that if they won by
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
plurality they don't really have a
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:18.950 align:start position:0%
plurality they don't really have a
mandate

02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have a mandate more people
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
voted against them than voted for them
 
02:18:28.509 --> 02:18:28.519 align:start position:0%
in regular plurality election in a rank
 
02:18:31.230 --> 02:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
Choice voting election they can take
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
office and do take office with a
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
mandate they got more than 50% of the
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
votes so it's good for republicans and
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
Democrats it's actually better for them
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
than for The Independents and the greens
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
to answer the question no The
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
Independents and the greens have not won
 
02:18:56.549 --> 02:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
any rank Choice voting elections in
 
02:18:58.589 --> 02:18:58.599 align:start position:0%
Maine since it
 
02:18:58.599 --> 02:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
Maine since it
was

02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
implemented what's good for them is that
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
the depth of
 
02:19:06.319 --> 02:19:07.990 align:start position:0%
the depth of
their

02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
support is shown in a rank Choice voting
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
election because if you're a green
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
supporter or a libertarian going to vote
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
in a normal election if you vote you
 
02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
know your candidate isn't going to win
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
and so that in theory is a wasted vote
 
02:19:30.910 --> 02:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a wasted vote they get to vote
 
02:19:34.349 --> 02:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
for the party that they they most
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
support but what will happen is there
 
02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
will be a number of green people or
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
Libertarians who go to the polls and say
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
well wait a minute my my support doesn't
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
matter so I'll vote vote for a
 
02:19:50.590 --> 02:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democrat because I think
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
they you know well in a rank Choice
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
voting they get to vote for their
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
Greener libertarian party and that will
 
02:19:59.070 --> 02:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
show up and I'm going to show you how it
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
shows up which is your question uh it
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
will show up in the
 
02:20:08.429 --> 02:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
results and that's good for the
 
02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
Libertarians because the Libertarians
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
who might otherwise get 1% of the vote
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
in a rank Choice voting election in the
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
first round that libertarian candidate
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
who's not going to win but he may get 5%
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
or 10% and they're going to feel good
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
and when they go to their supporters
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
they say look here's our support in the
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
state so that's why it's good for all
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
parties the re the the the results show
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
the depth of support and for
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
the non- major parties and for the major
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
parties it will give them a mandate that
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
they would not not otherwise have to
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
implement their policies in you know in
 
02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
the state so that's that's a a critical
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
thing now if
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
you and I want to address one other uh
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
thing uh I should say that I want you to
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
know I work for the as a volunteer I
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
have never been paid 10 years time I do
 
02:21:18.429 --> 02:21:18.439 align:start position:0%
not get paid for my opinions or my work
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
welcome to the $100 for twoe there you
 
02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
go uh and uh and I I first got exposed
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
to rank Choice voting in
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
2011 when it was implemented for the
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
mayor's race in Portland there were 15
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot right and I
 
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
studied the results in the same way that
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
I've studied the results in all of the
 
02:21:46.399 --> 02:21:47.910 align:start position:0%
I've studied the results in all of the
Statewide

02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
Statewide
main

02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
main
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
elections um and what you see is that
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
more more candidates on the ballot the
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
rank more people on the ballot the more
 
02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
people will rank I say you you know you
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
think about it it's just makes sense and
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's in fact what you see
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
happen do people rank all of the
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
candidates no they do not have to and
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
relatively few of them do and the more
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
candidates there are the less people
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
will rank all of them okay but here's
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
remember in all rank Choice voting
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
elections no matter how many can who
 
02:22:54.429 --> 02:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
ballot wins 90% of the time the person
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
who is
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
second on the ballot meaning second in
 
02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:08.810 align:start position:0%
the first place votes wins
 
02:23:08.810 --> 02:23:10.150 align:start position:0%
the first place votes wins
[Music]

02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
99.9% of the
 
02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.550 align:start position:0%
99.9% of the
time

02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:23:19.389 --> 02:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
99.9% of rank Choice voting elections go
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
to either the first person who gets the
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
most votes in the first round or the
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
person who gets the most votes in the
 
02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:29.950 align:start position:0%
person who gets the most votes in the
second

02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
round one tenth of 1% go to the person
 
02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
who gets the third most
 
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
votes that's it if you
 
02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:46.070 align:start position:0%
votes that's it if you
mathematically

02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
mathematically
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:49.630 align:start position:0%
mathematically
it

02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way okay just doesn't
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
work so does somebody and one of the
 
02:23:57.990 --> 02:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
criticisms of rank CH voting is well
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who's you know's not very
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
popular doesn't have a lot of people who
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
really like him him or her but ends up
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
with you know a lot of votes in the out
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
rounds it just doesn't happen okay all
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
right so I want to show if you take my
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
testimony which is the one says my name
 
02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
is Phil steel and look at the third page
 
02:24:24.750 --> 02:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
this is really interesting and I'd be
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
willing to bet most of you have never
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
seen this
 
02:24:33.710 --> 02:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
um this is what's called the cast vote
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
record this is
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
produced by the Secretary of State's
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
office at the top of this page and what
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
is and uh to answer the question how
 
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
does the public find out about what
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
happened in election right 90,000 voters
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
for in this District this is November of
 
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
2018 this is the one where pin got the
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
most votes in the first round and lost
 
02:25:08.349 --> 02:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
in the second round actually lost in the
 
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
third round uh but four candidates three
 
02:25:19.389 --> 02:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
rounds uh golden one in the third round
 
02:25:22.510 --> 02:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
okay now this is what the secretary of
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
state provides the public if you ask for
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
it you can see every voter and how they
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
voted how how they filled out their
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
ballot and you'll see number one voter
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
undervote

02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't fill out a name in that
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
column so the first voter here V ranked
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
Bruce poliquin number one number two and
 
02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.349 align:start position:0%
Bruce poliquin number one number two and
number

02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
three technically a violation of the
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
rules which say you can only rank a
 
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:12.389 align:start position:0%
rules which say you can only rank a
candidate

02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
once all right and this is important the
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
rule say you can only rank a candidate
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
once this guy voted this person voted
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
for him three times voted for him three
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
times he ranked them three times okay
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
that vote the way the votes are
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
counted number one is exactly the same
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
as number
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
two who ranked Paquin first and didn't
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
rank anybody else okay voter number
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
one's ballot was filled out differently
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
than voter number
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
two they preferred Bruce poliquin to all
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
other candidates and that is how the
 
02:27:06.990 --> 02:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
vote is
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
counted by the
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
software all right and you can see the
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
other on I want I want to address number
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
six they did not vote that person voter
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
number six did not vote for anybody in
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
the congressional district number two
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
race they probably voted for other
 
02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
candidates in other races that otherwise
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have gone to the polls
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
right but they didn't have a preference
 
02:27:37.630 --> 02:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
in Congressional District number one
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay so you can see how these voters
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
voted now
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
see in the first round if you look at
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
the first choices you'll see that
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's four people who voted for
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
poliquin there's two people who voted
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
for Golden there's two people who voted
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
for and there's one person who
 
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
voted for Bond now again there's
 
02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
actually 290,000 voters I just took the
 
02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:13.230 align:start position:0%
actually 290,000 voters I just took the
first

02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
10 all right and and I'm showing you how
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
the vote are counted this is literally
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
how the votes are counted so there's 4
 
02:28:25.950 --> 02:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
221 at the end of the first round poin
 
02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:27.309 align:start position:0%
221 at the end of the first round poin
is

02:28:27.309 --> 02:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
ahead but he doesn't have a
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
majority he doesn't have
 
02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.630 align:start position:0%
majority he doesn't have
50%

02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
50%
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
so it goes to a second round and they
 
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.910 align:start position:0%
so it goes to a second round and they
drop

02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
drop
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
Bond Tiffany Bond candidate number 10
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
that vote is now they look at the second
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
choice for that person that's golden so
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
you can see in the second round golden
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
has gone from two to three and bond is
 
02:29:00.110 --> 02:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
no longer in the
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
race all
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
right uh Paquin is still ahead but he
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
majority so it goes to the third round
 
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
right and now is the least has
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
only got two votes so those votes are
 
02:29:18.910 --> 02:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
dropped and
 
02:29:23.269 --> 02:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
that's and if you look that's person
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
five who voted for
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
first and nine who voted for
 
02:29:33.230 --> 02:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
first and so they go to the second votes
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
and so that's
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
poliquin and
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh poliquin gets one of the votes but
 
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
number nine voted for Tiffany Bond
 
02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
number nine voted for Tiffany Bond
second

02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
but she's already out of the race so in
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
that case they go to the third
 
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
choice and that's poin so in the third
 
02:29:59.269 --> 02:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
round poliquin now has
 
02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
six votes and golden has three and if it
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
this was the election for these 10
 
02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
people Paquin would have
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
won in the third round he there is no
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
bullets their ballot which is the one
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
where somebody ask where somebody votes
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
for the same candidate first second
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
third fourth or however many there
 
02:30:38.349 --> 02:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
are that is not counted any differently
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
than the person who votes for that
 
02:30:44.349 --> 02:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
person wants and doesn't vote for any
 
02:30:47.349 --> 02:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
other that person has
 
02:30:47.359 --> 02:30:48.469 align:start position:0%
other that person has
one

02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
vote in each round and it's their vote
 
02:30:57.269 --> 02:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
stays with the person that they voted
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
for in the first round as long as that
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
person is still in the race that's the
 
02:31:07.630 --> 02:31:07.640 align:start position:0%
way rank Choice voting works now I W to
 
02:31:10.269 --> 02:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh I want to just mention that I spent a
 
02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
time educating voters about how rank
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
Choice voting works
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what my testimony on the
 
02:31:23.710 --> 02:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
first two pages of this is about and uh
 
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh and it's really really
 
02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
interesting and um so I want to speak
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
about if you get down to the bottom of
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
the first page I have three major
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
observations about that as both an
 
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
educator somebody who went out and talk
 
02:31:43.630 --> 02:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
to people about rank Choice voting and
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
as a data analyst right the first first
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
point here at the conceptual
 
02:31:55.150 --> 02:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
level nobody has any trouble with what
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting is all about they
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
understand that RCV gives you an
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to express your preferences
 
02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
ah candidate Smith is my first choice
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
candidate Jones is my second
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
choice Etc or I don't like any anybody
 
02:32:18.750 --> 02:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
except candidate
 
02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
Smith or I like Smith and Jones but I
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't like Herbert and whatever that's
 
02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
what rank Choice voting gives you the
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
do and the data fact is that the vast
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
majority of main voters when given the
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity rank candidates the more
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot the more
 
02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:44.910 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot the more
they'll

02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
they'll
 
02:32:48.269 --> 02:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
rank uh and and and you can see the
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
actual results of that if you look at
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
page two in
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
the testimony of Adam and
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
myself uh uh he wrote the first part he
 
02:33:02.349 --> 02:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't come today and I wrote the
 
02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
second part with the data um you know 70
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
70 80% 90% depending on which election
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
people rank more than one candidate
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr steel
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
um when we have pin cards we ask people
 
02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
to estimate how long they're going to
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
speak and we're way over your five
 
02:33:27.150 --> 02:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
minutes okay um and I just want to make
 
02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure because my goal is to try to get
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
through these rank Choice bills by 1230
 
02:33:36.269 --> 02:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
or close to there and then break for
 
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
lunch to start the afternoon bills
 
02:33:41.269 --> 02:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
because I think the and I we have an
 
02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:43.640 align:start position:0%
awful lot of people to testim to testify
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that we're going to be
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
able to do I will say that I I thought
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
your that the count thing that you gave
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
us was very helpful so I just want to
 
02:33:54.269 --> 02:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
make one other one other point yeah
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
which is point number two okay and this
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
is two very quick points one is people
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
understand conceptually rank Choice
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
voting very quickly and when given look
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
ballot they understand the ballot First
 
02:34:19.349 --> 02:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
Choice second choice third choice it's
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
easy the data shows on the second point
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
that the number of people who do not
 
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
fill out their ballot in a way that
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
their votes are counted correctly in the
 
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
system is very small 21 of
 
02:34:44.269 --> 02:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
1% fill out the ballot wrong so that
 
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
their votes cannot be
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
counted and that two10 of 1% is what you
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
will find in most general elections non
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting elections very close
 
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
to the same number so people do not have
 
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
trouble filling out the Ballance what
 
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
people do have trouble with is
 
02:35:09.309 --> 02:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
understanding how the votes are counted
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
just like you're trying to figure out
 
02:35:14.429 --> 02:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
how the votes are counted right and
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
unless you're taking through through an
 
02:35:19.469 --> 02:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
example like I took you
 
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
through you know you're not really going
 
02:35:25.469 --> 02:35:25.479 align:start position:0%
to understand it but that's okay because
 
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
the software does it
 
02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
correctly all right and votes do get
 
02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
counted at least in Maine and I've
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the cast vote records of the
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
third of the three rank Choice voting
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide elections uh and as is
 
02:35:44.429 --> 02:35:44.439 align:start position:0%
documented here in my testimony I thank
 
02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
you for uh you um if anybody had
 
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to answer them
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that you do have
 
02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to answer them
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
afterwards so thank you very much
 
02:35:57.070 --> 02:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee members questions for Mr steel
 
02:36:01.309 --> 02:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
before he retreats to the back room and
 
02:36:02.910 --> 02:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
during break I'm sure people will be
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
around if you want to ask questions but
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought that written
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
material was very helpful anybody well
 
02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
set okay um also signed up to speak I
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
have Austin Matt
 
02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:16.429 align:start position:0%
have Austin Matt
matte

02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
matte
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
he had to
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
leave um all right and Mr Matt had
 
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
handouts for people um on this bill
 
02:36:30.429 --> 02:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
which I will do during the break um he's
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
okay also signed up to oh Rick yames had
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
to had to leave
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
right yep he's
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
C Alvin says he has a handout and three
 
02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
minutes Alvin has been before this
 
02:37:02.269 --> 02:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
committee before so he knows the timer
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
is about to
 
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
start Alvin if you just want to pass
 
02:37:09.630 --> 02:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
those out a few if you have a
 
02:37:12.870 --> 02:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
handout okay I have one hand out here
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
and all right we're going to put that in
 
02:37:18.389 --> 02:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
the record you don't have copies I have
 
02:37:22.230 --> 02:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
I have a copy for you okay all
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
here we're on
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
1482 right and I had uh I I did have a
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
quick question are we only talking about
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
this one bill or all three of them
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
together it it's it's easier to just do
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
it on the bill that we're talking about
 
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recognize representative
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.309 --> 02:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
okay can you wait three minutes I'm I'm
 
02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
timing him I prom he knows so all right
 
02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
go uh for the record I'm Alvin C Liv
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
lden and I am opposed to the bill I
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
think there are several issues to to be
 
02:38:26.429 --> 02:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
concerned about on this bill uh in spite
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
of testimony earlier I still think there
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
may be a
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
legal uh challenge that may not pass
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with our
 
02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
constitution requiring uh plurality of
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
votes for uh Governor counselor and
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
Senator and uh just as an aside
 
02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:48.590 align:start position:0%
Senator and uh just as an aside
this

02:38:48.590 --> 02:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh committee researchers report on the
 
02:38:54.990 --> 02:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
second page that uh says state
 
02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.269 align:start position:0%
second page that uh says state
representatives

02:38:56.269 --> 02:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
are uh to be blur out vote but not in
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
our constitution it's the
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
counselor not the state representative
 
02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
which handout were you referring to
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
Alvin uh this was one that I saw over
 
02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
there it's it's uh addressed to you from
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh Christina
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
Dyer okay um
 
02:39:17.990 --> 02:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
oh it's it's our it's our committee
 
02:39:20.830 --> 02:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
researcher work okay thank you on the
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
second page in the Box the middle
 
02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:24.190 align:start position:0%
second page in the Box the middle
paragraph

02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:25.750 align:start position:0%
paragraph
Okay

02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
Okay
 
02:39:28.349 --> 02:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
um I think this bill would require
 
02:39:30.269 --> 02:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
extensive training for voters and
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
election officials uh I think it was
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
oversimplified as in previous
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
testimony um with with uh this bill all
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
the acuo machines in the state become
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
obsolete and have to be replaced there's
 
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
that um shows about $4 and a half
 
02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:52.990 align:start position:0%
that um shows about $4 and a half
million

02:39:52.990 --> 02:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
dollar uh to replace all that but that
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does not identify the
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
central processing equipment and the
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
training and programming that goes with
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
that um and also just as a and aside
 
02:40:10.990 --> 02:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
there are two bills come this afternoon
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
that would eliminate ballot counting
 
02:40:16.110 --> 02:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
machines and uh for people who are
 
02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
skeptical of computers and electronic
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
devices uh this is not the system
 
02:40:24.750 --> 02:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
because it requires much more computer
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
processing transfer of data from various
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
polling places to a central location and
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
such so I recommendation of itl on this
 
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much and I'll answer
 
02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:38.840 align:start position:0%

02:40:47.309 --> 02:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
request so thank you thank
 
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
next is what's the name of the next
 
02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:01.790 align:start position:0%
next is what's the name of the next
person

02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%

02:41:10.910 --> 02:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
Handover thank you I will be brief I
 
02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
teach public policy at Dartmouth College
 
02:41:15.790 --> 02:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm the founding chair of United
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
America which is a group that works on
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
process reforms around the country to
 
02:41:21.550 --> 02:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
try and promote a healing of our
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
partisanship since I assume I'm not
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
under oath if I'm asked if I've ever met
 
02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:28.100 align:start position:0%
Professor Mirad I will deny
 
02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
Professor Mirad I will deny
[Laughter]

02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
it I just have four quick points to make
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
the first is and many of them are going
 
02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
to put a finer point on things that
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
you've already heard R Choice vote
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
better expresses the collective will of
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
the electorate than first pass the post
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to give you two not
 
02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
uncommon examples that I think make that
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
point the first is a three-way race and
 
02:41:56.269 --> 02:41:56.279 align:start position:0%
let's call them candidates a b and X
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
where A and B are relatively mainstream
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
candidates and in a head-to-head race a
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
beats B 52 to 48 it's very clear that
 
02:42:06.830 --> 02:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
this is the candidate preferred by the
 
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
state's voters now we introdu cand
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
introduced candidate X who draws just 5%
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the vote has no chance of getting
 
02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
elected and the chair used the term
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
wasted vote I'm going to use the the
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
term spoiler because it's not just that
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
folks who vote for X have no chance of
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
electing X it's that it then distorts
 
02:42:30.910 --> 02:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
the outcome between a and b and it is
 
02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:31.710 align:start position:0%
the outcome between a and b and it is
not

02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
oncommon that all of x's votes come from
 
02:42:36.510 --> 02:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
one candidate or the other because these
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
even if they're Independents they tend
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
to be outside of the mainstream so it's
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable that candidate X might
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
be a super Progressive candidate who
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
draws all of his or her votes from the
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
Democrat or a Libertarian candidate who
 
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
draws all of his or her votes from the
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
Republican but the net effect is if all
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
5% come from candidate a b now wins
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
5847 which is not consistent with what
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
the state's voters want that is a
 
02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
problem with our current system that is
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
solved by rank Choice a related problem
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
is a crowded field particularly in a
 
02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
primary election or an open municipal
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
election where you may have six or seven
 
02:43:19.550 --> 02:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
candidates one of whom maybe has
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
25% support but no depth beyond that
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
most voters would prefer perhaps one of
 
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
four or five other candidates who are
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
broadly similar the votes get spread
 
02:43:32.830 --> 02:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
among those similar candidates and the
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
candidate with just
 
02:43:37.389 --> 02:43:37.399 align:start position:0%
25% wins even though that candidate
 
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
would have lost a head-to-head race with
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
many of the other candidates in the
 
02:43:45.469 --> 02:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
field so in both of those cases the
 
02:43:48.110 --> 02:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
current system distorts the preferences
 
02:43:50.790 --> 02:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
of Voters that's number one is this is a
 
02:43:53.309 --> 02:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
system that better measures what the
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
electorate wants number two which is
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
that has been hinted at but I think is
 
02:43:59.230 --> 02:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
more important and deserves a little
 
02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
attention is rank Choice voting leads to
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
more civil
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
races and the reason should be obvious
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is if I'm running against Russ
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
whom I've never met right I want those
 
02:44:15.469 --> 02:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
folks who are going to vote for Russ I
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
want to be their second choice so I
 
02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
might say okay he's you know I don't
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
think you should vote for him but if you
 
02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
do know that I also care about these
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
things that he cares about and one
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
measure of whether Independents are
 
02:44:31.230 --> 02:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
helped by this rank Choice voting is not
 
02:44:33.309 --> 02:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
just whether they win more often or even
 
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
if they get more a higher percentage of
 
02:44:37.469 --> 02:44:37.479 align:start position:0%
the vote because they're still losing
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's the degree to which they can tell
 
02:44:42.110 --> 02:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
the electorate about things they care
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
about and that mainstream candidates
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
adopt those ideas perhaps even co-opt
 
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
them in the effort of being the second
 
02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
choice for those voters so it is a way
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
by which candidates who might not be
 
02:44:56.510 --> 02:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
able to win can still have their ideas
 
02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
radiated out into the public and adopted
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
by the candidates who do win number
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
three and this is one where I think
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
since we're looking at United America at
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
the nation I just want to express that
 
02:45:09.389 --> 02:45:09.399 align:start position:0%
rank choice is already popular it is
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
growing quite quickly and it tends to be
 
02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
popular with voters so you've heard
 
02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
about Maine you heard a little bit about
 
02:45:17.429 --> 02:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
Alaska but that was passed by popular
 
02:45:19.630 --> 02:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
referendum in 2020 all federal and state
 
02:45:23.790 --> 02:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
elections will be RCV Wyoming Kansas and
 
02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
Nevada use RCV for presidential
 
02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
primaries Indiana Virginia and Utah use
 
02:45:31.550 --> 02:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
it for party conventions it is very
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
popular at the municipal level I think
 
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
23 cities in Utah alone five more passed
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
it in 2020 by referendum and then of
 
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
course famously New York City in 2021
 
02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
which we haven't talked about so in data
 
02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
from New York City 95% of New York City
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
voters described the RCV ballot as
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
simple to complete 77 said 77% said they
 
02:45:58.110 --> 02:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
would use it in future elections and I
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
will give you this written testimony
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards there are also some studies
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
that I've cited that people describe
 
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
mayoral races with RCB as more civil
 
02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
there was a poll in Santa Fe in 2018
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
where 68% of Voters said that the quote
 
02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
the tone of their first mayoral election
 
02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
with RCV was more more positive than
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
prior mayoral elections and then the
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
last point is despite the startup costs
 
02:46:23.790 --> 02:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
which are non-significant or which are
 
02:46:25.950 --> 02:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
non-trivial it saves
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
money by preventing or by making
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary runoff elections I think
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
this is particularly important for the
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
second Bill you're going to discuss for
 
02:46:36.030 --> 02:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities because it is effectively
 
02:46:38.309 --> 02:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
an instant runoff in New York City
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
obviously much bigger than any City in
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
Maine but they did save $20 million by
 
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
not having to have a runoff of election
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
so it's a better way of measuring the
 
02:46:50.429 --> 02:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
electorates will it it will encourage
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
more civil elections people like it once
 
02:46:55.269 --> 02:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
they've done it and it will save money
 
02:46:57.550 --> 02:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the long run thank
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
02:47:03.710 --> 02:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
wheelen I have a
 
02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned its
 
02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.110 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned its
popularity

02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
popularity
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
in state party elections and primaries
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
and certainly if you look at
 
02:47:20.349 --> 02:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
the the list of where it's used that's
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
used isn't the core voter base in those
 
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
elections more aligned to begin with
 
02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
from an ideological standpoint thereby
 
02:47:40.190 --> 02:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
making any sort of
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
runoff and I don't think it is the same
 
02:47:47.550 --> 02:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
as a runoff but making any sort of
 
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
ranking more palatable to the ranker
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
than it would be in a
 
02:47:59.590 --> 02:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
multi-party or ideological race it could
 
02:48:01.230 --> 02:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
be it's certainly true with primaries
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to see only a truncated
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
part of the the electorate and that's
 
02:48:08.110 --> 02:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
why it does make sense but it's also
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
true that a Municipal elections I would
 
02:48:12.030 --> 02:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
assume you're seeing kind of a
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
relatively broad spectrum of what people
 
02:48:16.510 --> 02:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
might want New York city mayor race it
 
02:48:18.269 --> 02:48:18.279 align:start position:0%
was mostly about the primary I think to
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
your point uh I I think because it
 
02:48:22.269 --> 02:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
solves that spoiler problem with
 
02:48:24.190 --> 02:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
Independence though I think it's a it's
 
02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
a logical time to make that leap and in
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
Maine one of the reasons one of the many
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
impetuses for the popularity of that
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
referendum was that they had had an
 
02:48:38.269 --> 02:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
independent governor and in that
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial race with three all viable
 
02:48:44.910 --> 02:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
candidates the first post that first
 
02:48:46.590 --> 02:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
past the post system really messed up
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
priorities so it was actually their
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
general election with a republican an
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
independent incumbent and a Democrat
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
that people said I can't use the current
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
system and make a sane choice in this
 
02:49:00.510 --> 02:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
election so I I think your point is well
 
02:49:02.830 --> 02:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
taken but I'm not sure that means that
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate then for general
 
02:49:07.469 --> 02:49:07.479 align:start position:0%
elections thank you any other questions
 
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative mhan good to meet you yes
 
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative Morehead is it a is this
 
02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.790 align:start position:0%
representative Morehead is it a is this
a

02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
I I would have thought at first sight
 
02:49:18.190 --> 02:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
that this is the kind of thing that
 
02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
liberals like it's just kind of like a
 
02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
complicated do gooder thing that appeals
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
to to those of us who are liberals and
 
02:49:26.190 --> 02:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh but listening to your examples I hear
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
Utah I hear Kansas when I think about
 
02:49:30.429 --> 02:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
just running it through history I think
 
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
wow in in 92 George HW Bush probably
 
02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
would have beat Clinton because the
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
spoiler effect of Ross perau wouldn't
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
have benefited Clinton so it could you
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
know could benefit Republicans could
 
02:49:42.750 --> 02:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats um so I just wanted you invite
 
02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
you to comment on the partisan aspect of
 
02:49:46.510 --> 02:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
this this is this a truly nonpartisan
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
idea it is truly nonpartisan now in any
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
particular race it may have it may
 
02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
benefit one party or the other because
 
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
it depends on who the independent might
 
02:49:57.229 --> 02:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
be it depends how the people look in the
 
02:49:59.469 --> 02:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
field relative to one another but
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's nothing methodologically about
 
02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
it at all that favors one party or the
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
other and in fact if you project out our
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
current partisan environment God
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
forbid you can certainly imagine a
 
02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
scenario where if I want to win wearing
 
02:50:17.150 --> 02:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
team Jersey blue or team jersey red I'm
 
02:50:19.590 --> 02:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
going to start running Independence you
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
know who look like you strategically you
 
02:50:23.710 --> 02:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to fund the guy who is to
 
02:50:24.990 --> 02:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
the right of you if you're a republican
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna fund the person who's to the
 
02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
left of a Democrat I mean our current
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
system is prone to hacking in that
 
02:50:34.750 --> 02:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
regard by either party or by anybody who
 
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
wants to use try not to use the word
 
02:50:38.269 --> 02:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
hacking in New Hampshire oh yes yes
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you try try try uh so it it is not
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
inherently ideological and I fail to
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
mention I'm old enough to remember
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
horsejack so thank you for that
 
02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
reference but my first job in politics
 
02:50:52.110 --> 02:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
was writing speeches for the governor of
 
02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
Maine John mcer and he ran for
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
re-election in a he's a republican ran
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
for election with an independent who got
 
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
like seven or eight percent now mccon
 
02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
was reelected but only with like 43% of
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
the vote and it was the independent
 
02:51:08.269 --> 02:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
completely messed up both the campaign
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
the winner MC in that case didn't have
 
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
majority support so yes short answer is
 
02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
it can affect either party depending on
 
02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
the circumstances and I think that's a
 
02:51:18.790 --> 02:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
really important consideration thank you
 
02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:20.710 align:start position:0%
really important consideration thank you
further

02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%

02:51:22.910 --> 02:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very

b sorry about that standing up and
 
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
writing on a
 
02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
clipboard and you have written test yes
 
02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
it was emailed last night and I handed
 
02:51:43.670 --> 02:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
out some hard copies I didn't print one
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
for everyone I apologize thank you all
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
right I go quickly to make up time how's
 
02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
that terrific okay if you look at the
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of States um September one
 
02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
numbers 37% of registered voters are
 
02:51:59.870 --> 02:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
Undeclared you hear a lot that us
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters are really Republicans
 
02:52:03.389 --> 02:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
Or democrats well that might have been
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
true a number of years ago but with the
 
02:52:08.150 --> 02:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
polarization um of both parties we're
 
02:52:11.950 --> 02:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
not very happy at all um we want more
 
02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
and better choices do you know how
 
02:52:16.229 --> 02:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
frustrating it is is to go make the time
 
02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
and the effort to go to the primaries
 
02:52:20.910 --> 02:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
and vote just to find out that the
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
person that won is somebody that 70% of
 
02:52:25.150 --> 02:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
us wanted somebody else because the
 
02:52:28.269 --> 02:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
person with 30% won that's not a
 
02:52:31.389 --> 02:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
majority when most the most people would
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
prefer anybody but that candidate my
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
town in
 
02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
2022 has three elections you look at the
 
02:52:42.030 --> 02:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
clerk's budget it's 32,000 yes that's up
 
02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
a lot historically but I think it's the
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
same everywhere where that doesn't
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
include the police details fire details
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
the DPW setting it up or the fact that
 
02:52:52.110 --> 02:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
there won't be school that day all right
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
if we just round down and call it
 
02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 there's 326 polling places in
 
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's $3.3 million and
 
02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's just what the towns pay or the
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
cities do you does anyone here know what
 
02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office pays for
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
a presidential primary I I don't know
 
02:53:12.429 --> 02:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
does anyone have that number no continue
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
please we we should good to have I've
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
asked a number of times if you get it
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
and you can get it to me I'd appreciate
 
02:53:19.950 --> 02:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
it um but I just if a round up call it$
 
02:53:22.990 --> 02:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
700,000 that gets us to $4 million every
 
02:53:25.790 --> 02:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
two years for that number now when you
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
get that number you know you can ignore
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
the presidential primary it'd be
 
02:53:32.990 --> 02:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
interesting but for the meals and and um
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh reeven the meals the hotel meals tax
 
02:53:37.950 --> 02:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's let's leave it alone but if you go
 
02:53:41.110 --> 02:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
back to that 37% of that4 million that's
 
02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:42.630 align:start position:0%
back to that 37% of that4 million that's
$1.5

02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
$1.5
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
million all right that us Undeclared you
 
02:53:47.870 --> 02:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
know vote voters are paying for
 
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
primaries that just are not working for
 
02:53:53.070 --> 02:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
us now is the time to fix that problem
 
02:53:54.990 --> 02:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
we need to get going with rank Choice
 
02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
voting as soon as we can all right I
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
brought two books one is called the
 
02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
political industry um one of the authors
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
is Michael Porter all right Michael
 
02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
Porter if you know him is a famous
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
Harvard business strategy Professor when
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
asked how to fix some of the problems in
 
02:54:12.309 --> 02:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
our country rank Choice voting
 
02:54:14.670 --> 02:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
approaches is what they're putting forth
 
02:54:16.590 --> 02:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
my book is called consuming government
 
02:54:18.429 --> 02:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
and the premise of this book is that
 
02:54:20.429 --> 02:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
we're irresponsible consumers for all
 
02:54:22.349 --> 02:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
the government we're buying so if we're
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
spending $1.5 million for primaries that
 
02:54:26.510 --> 02:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
aren't working for me I'm trying to make
 
02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
a stink all right I'm you're spending my
 
02:54:32.110 --> 02:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
money and I'm not happy right because it
 
02:54:33.590 --> 02:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't the way the system works does
 
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
not work for me um I also put in the
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
links to the common denominator push out
 
02:54:41.309 --> 02:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
a newsletter I've also spent a decade um
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
running our civic league put together a
 
02:54:44.910 --> 02:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
newsletter that
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
briefs out in bullet points what's going
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
in our town I spend a tremendous amount
 
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
of time my personal time trying to help
 
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
people be educated inform so we can make
 
02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
better decisions it's a hobby I don't
 
02:54:58.269 --> 02:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
golf for fish all right there is no one
 
02:55:01.150 --> 02:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
Panacea for everything all right but the
 
02:55:02.830 --> 02:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things we can
 
02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
do quickly is rank Choice voting so
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%

02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
voting and uh I'm here today I'm not uh
 
02:56:16.190 --> 02:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
with a couple points one I want to make
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
really quickly uh the important question
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
was raised about if you did itop during
 
02:56:23.469 --> 02:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
Choice voting uh what kind of education
 
02:56:25.349 --> 02:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
would be needed and like any kind of
 
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
change that in in elections like
 
02:56:30.190 --> 02:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
education is very important voter
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
education educating candidates and
 
02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
educating um co-workers and election
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
administrators the good news is uh there
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
are many national organizations and
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
state Foundation National and state
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
organizations and Foundations standing
 
02:56:45.670 --> 02:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
by ready to help the state of New
 
02:56:46.950 --> 02:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the state of New Hampshire
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
would not have to do this alone you just
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
got the offer from um communications
 
02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
director Len cook from the main
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State uh to help with that
 
02:56:57.389 --> 02:56:57.399 align:start position:0%
education process at all those different
 
02:56:59.710 --> 02:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
levels and in fact this process is going
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
on right now in Alaska which adopted
 
02:57:05.950 --> 02:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting by referendum in 2020
 
02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
and actually uh Professor wand's
 
02:57:09.229 --> 02:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
organization United America is
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
participating in that that process so I
 
02:57:13.190 --> 02:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
just want to let you let you know I'm
 
02:57:16.030 --> 02:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
sure um um New Hampshire rank Choice
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
voting can tell you a lot more about
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
that but um great resources available
 
02:57:21.590 --> 02:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
today if you were doing this for the
 
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
first time back in
 
02:57:25.269 --> 02:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
2000 good help would be a lot harder to
 
02:57:27.190 --> 02:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
find doing this in 2020 with all the
 
02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
momentum behind the issue you're going
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
to you're going to have more help than
 
02:57:32.309 --> 02:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
you could
 
02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
imagine so what I want to talk about uh
 
02:57:37.469 --> 02:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
real quick is what a unique opportunity
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is for New Hampshire specifically
 
02:57:41.950 --> 02:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is exceptional and
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
having the most extensive use of multi
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
member districts in their state
 
02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
legislature of anywhere in the US and um
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is there's some real benefits that
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters enjoy from this
 
02:57:54.349 --> 02:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
current system so I want to talk about
 
02:57:56.030 --> 02:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
some of the good things about the way
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
you vote now you get greater choice of
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
candidates and voters can make more than
 
02:58:01.950 --> 02:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
one selection when you run in one of
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
those elections as I imagine many of you
 
02:58:06.670 --> 02:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
have um you're more empowered to run for
 
02:58:08.790 --> 02:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
something I'm hoping everybody has and
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's why you're here right everybody
 
02:58:14.110 --> 02:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
ran okay awesome well some may be from s
 
02:58:16.750 --> 02:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
member districts you have a few but yeah
 
02:58:20.469 --> 02:58:20.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um you can run more likely
 
02:58:21.870 --> 02:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to run for something rather
 
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
than be perceived as running against a
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
person because you're you're one of many
 
02:58:27.550 --> 02:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
running and many being elected you're
 
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
not fighting one incumbent for that seat
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a more positive Dynamic
 
02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
this type of system you have has
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
strongly correlated with more
 
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
cross-partisan gender equity in
 
02:58:39.070 --> 02:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
government in the handful of states that
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
use it and has contributed to New
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and pat yourself on the back
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
here leading the country in elected
 
02:58:46.950 --> 02:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
women so congratulations on that that's
 
02:58:50.429 --> 02:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
a huge positive thing you got an A the
 
02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
only state to get an A in 20120 from
 
02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:54.349 align:start position:0%
only state to get an A in 20120 from
represent

02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:58:56.750 --> 02:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
women uh but these benefits are just a
 
02:58:58.309 --> 02:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
beginning of what is possible and there
 
02:58:59.870 --> 02:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
are currently some drawbacks to the
 
02:59:01.710 --> 02:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
current system the main problem is this
 
02:59:03.870 --> 02:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
problem of District sweeps that happens
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
when you elect these multiple members of
 
02:59:07.229 --> 02:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
the district the way we do it now where
 
02:59:09.670 --> 02:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
frequently one or the other party will
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
win all the seats and supporters of the
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
other party get none of the seats and
 
02:59:15.150 --> 02:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
some of these districts are as big as
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know nine nine members being elected
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
I believe in in the in competitive
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
districts where you have like New
 
02:59:23.070 --> 02:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a very kind of purpley
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
state there's a lot of Republicans
 
02:59:26.269 --> 02:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Democrats you can have
 
02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
these districts going back and forth
 
02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
regularly just kind of based on
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
turnout so rank Choice voting uh offers
 
02:59:34.309 --> 02:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
a solution to this rank Choice voting
 
02:59:35.389 --> 02:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
specifically with proportional
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
representation in these multi
 
02:59:38.190 --> 02:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts which is
 
02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
described in the handout that Tiani
 
02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
offered you offers a solution that could
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire government even
 
02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
better and actually be a model to the
 
02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
rest of the United States which does not
 
02:59:49.630 --> 02:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
have the benefits of some of these
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
multi-member districts right now it may
 
02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
seem paradoxical that a system with more
 
02:59:57.389 --> 02:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
competition in Choice can actually yield
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
more stability in government Civility
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
and service to the public good the same
 
03:00:03.870 --> 03:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
system of rank Choice voting I'm talking
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
about with multi-member districts exists
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the Republic of Ireland they've used
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
it for over 100 years and it has just
 
03:00:12.830 --> 03:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
that reputation it's very good for
 
03:00:14.349 --> 03:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
incumbents who serve their districts
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
well and very good for replacing those
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
who don't so proportional representation
 
03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
means no more sweeps no more throwing
 
03:00:23.309 --> 03:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
good incumbent babies out with the
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
partisan bathat so there's more
 
03:00:27.229 --> 03:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
continuity in the legislature with the
 
03:00:30.190 --> 03:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
most supported representative staying it
 
03:00:32.110 --> 03:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
reduces instability in the legislature
 
03:00:34.070 --> 03:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
due to these irregular turnover from
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
sweeps in between cycles and the most
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
important thing though about the system
 
03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
the most important valuable thing about
 
03:00:42.790 --> 03:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
proportional RCV which only States like
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in a position to realize
 
03:00:49.349 --> 03:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
right now is that um at any given time
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
almost every citizen in the district is
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
likely to be represented by a candidate
 
03:00:55.469 --> 03:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
they voted for and this is what you see
 
03:00:56.750 --> 03:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at the ballots and look at
 
03:00:59.429 --> 03:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
who's elected in places like Ireland and
 
03:01:00.750 --> 03:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
other plac there's a few places in the
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
US that use it as well the other quick
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
benefit is RCV is also simpler for
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
voters why because they no longer have
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
to make tough decisions about bullet
 
03:01:12.349 --> 03:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
voting their Uncle Jeff is running for
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
the first time and gosh that want to
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
make sure he wins but oh my gosh I'm
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
giving up four out of my five votes to
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
make sure Jeff wins they no longer have
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
to worry about that the way the ballots
 
03:01:23.950 --> 03:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
are counted takes that off the table you
 
03:01:25.830 --> 03:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
just rank your favorites and put Jeff
 
03:01:27.229 --> 03:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
first and you're doing everything you
 
03:01:28.269 --> 03:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
can for
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
Jeff so there's a growing consensus
 
03:01:32.190 --> 03:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
amongst many political scientists and
 
03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
good government groups like Charlie
 
03:01:35.389 --> 03:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
wheel's United America that by providing
 
03:01:37.870 --> 03:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
more Choice satisfying each voter with
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
accurate representation and encouraging
 
03:01:42.750 --> 03:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
politicians to appeal the people broadly
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
this system offers the best
 
03:01:46.269 --> 03:01:46.279 align:start position:0%
possibilities for reducing the worst
 
03:01:48.670 --> 03:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
aspects of negative partisanship you
 
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
know the kind of partisan ranker where
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
people are more worried about they hate
 
03:01:54.229 --> 03:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
the other side more than they like their
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
side so this reduces that and can help
 
03:02:00.429 --> 03:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
unite Americans around common goals this
 
03:02:02.150 --> 03:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
is highlighted in a recent report that
 
03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
just dropped this week from a group
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
called Protect America which focuses on
 
03:02:09.269 --> 03:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
solutions to threats to American

democracy and uh it talks about the
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
adopt successful adoption of this system
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
is part of the peace process not in the
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
Republic of Ireland that's used it for
 
03:02:19.190 --> 03:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
100 years but in Northern Ireland where
 
03:02:21.389 --> 03:02:21.399 align:start position:0%
there was this sectarian in religious

Strife that uh came to relative end in
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
the 2000s the violent part of it through
 
03:02:29.229 --> 03:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
a peace process and they adopted this
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
voting process specifically because of
 
03:02:33.870 --> 03:02:33.880 align:start position:0%

on 1482 and open the hearing on
 
03:05:09.790 --> 03:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
1264 1264 is a bill establishing rank
 
03:05:11.710 --> 03:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
Choice voting for State Party primary
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
elections and municipal elections and
 
03:05:16.269 --> 03:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
here to introduce the bill is the prime
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Reed thank you
 
03:05:19.710 --> 03:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair once again for the record
 
03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed representing Rockingham 17
 
03:05:23.790 --> 03:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
these are my bullet point notes on this
 
03:05:26.590 --> 03:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
testimony six whole lines they're
 
03:05:28.229 --> 03:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
abbreviated obviously first of all I
 
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the title it doesn't
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
establish necessarily what this entire
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill is everything you just heard about
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting all the wonderful
 
03:05:39.630 --> 03:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
awesome things about it now we're not
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
making anybody do any of it we're just
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
allowing towns because we are a Dillan R
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
state after all we're allowing towns to
 
03:05:48.110 --> 03:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
adopt it for their municipal election
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
should the voters of that town choose
 
03:05:53.710 --> 03:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
and we're allowing State parties to
 
03:05:57.309 --> 03:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
adopt it for their primaries both the
 
03:05:59.070 --> 03:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
state level primaries and the
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries um and that's
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's really it now most of you know
 
03:06:06.110 --> 03:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you know we're at
 
03:06:08.389 --> 03:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
Dylan's rule state which means we're not
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
home rule towns can't just do whatever
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
they want we have to enable them which
 
03:06:15.870 --> 03:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
is why this is enabling legislation we
 
03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
have a segment of legislation called
 
03:06:20.229 --> 03:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to allow towns to
 
03:06:22.030 --> 03:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
do things because we literally have to
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
say that they're allowed before they can
 
03:06:25.630 --> 03:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
do it um which is why we don't already
 
03:06:27.830 --> 03:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
have towns that do rank Choice voting
 
03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
but much like the states our
 
03:06:32.110 --> 03:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
Laboratories of democracy in our country
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
towns are and can be uh Laboratories of
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
democracy within New Hampshire uh many
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the states that have pursued rank
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
Choice voting further it's started with
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
towns in the in towns or municipalities
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
in those States so that's the municipal
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
level the party side of things parties
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
are of course private organizations but
 
03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
they do use the Secretary of State and
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer money to run their primary
 
03:07:00.429 --> 03:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
elections um primaries are very
 
03:07:02.349 --> 03:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
important to our the concept of
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
democracy or Republic uh very infamously
 
03:07:10.150 --> 03:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh a man by the name of uh Boss Tweed
 
03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
who was one of the uh kind of morally
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
dubious uh people in the 1800s in the
 
03:07:19.950 --> 03:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
tamy hall political machine kind of
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
famously said that he doesn't care who
 
03:07:24.190 --> 03:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
does the electing as long as he does the
 
03:07:26.190 --> 03:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
nominating meaning that it really
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if people can can vote in
 
03:07:32.710 --> 03:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
a general election if the choices in
 
03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
that election have already been
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
determined and that is the reason
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
primaries are so very important and why
 
03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
we should allow uh for all the reasons
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier in terms of spoiler
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
effect effect and having 17 30 whatever
 
03:07:47.950 --> 03:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
candidates in a in a primary why we
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
should allow parties if they choose to
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh to Institute rank Choice voting for
 
03:07:55.710 --> 03:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
their primaries um all of these things
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
are opt aable in fact the Party primary
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
um uh option opt in has to be done every
 
03:08:05.229 --> 03:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
election so literally before every
 
03:08:06.990 --> 03:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
primary I think it's 90 days before
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
every primary a party has to tell a
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that for their
 
03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
primary they would like to use rank
 
03:08:14.429 --> 03:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
Choice vote and then the secretary of
 
03:08:16.229 --> 03:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
state will operate that particular
 
03:08:19.309 --> 03:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
election via rank Choice voting for
 
03:08:21.550 --> 03:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
towns obviously they opt in and at any
 
03:08:23.670 --> 03:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
point just like anything else they do
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
they can repeal it um just in terms of
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
examples and this is my last point in
 
03:08:30.990 --> 03:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
2016 I believe there were 17 candidates
 
03:08:34.349 --> 03:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
on the presidential primary uh
 
03:08:37.469 --> 03:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
ticket uh and then about the same number
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in the 2020 Democratic
 
03:08:43.150 --> 03:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
presidential primary uh there was much
 
03:08:45.229 --> 03:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
speculation in both of those as to how
 
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
those would have gone had we had rank
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
Choice voting and a lot of complaining
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
about spoiler effect and with the
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
upcoming cd1 primary especially on the
 
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
Republican side I understand I think
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's already seven candidates and we
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
are still several months away from the
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
deadline to file that certainly There's
 
03:09:03.870 --> 03:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
real potential for someone to win that
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
who does not have the majority of the
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
Republican support having said that I'm
 
03:09:10.309 --> 03:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
done with my notes I'm happy to take
 
03:09:12.429 --> 03:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
questions and I would encourage anybody
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%

03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
2027
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
in uh Federal and State offices in this
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
bill um only enables 1264 only enables
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement whatsoever
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement whatsoever and in
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
the big what we call the big Bill the
 
03:09:53.950 --> 03:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
one you just heard that very lengthy
 
03:09:57.950 --> 03:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on for party primaries and for
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
towns it does not require it either it
 
03:10:04.670 --> 03:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
is only it enables it as the first stage
 
03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
of implementation by 2023 and then the
 
03:10:08.670 --> 03:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
other two stages of implementation have
 
03:10:11.309 --> 03:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
to do with General State elections so
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal both are enabling thank you
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
all right also signed up to speak on
 
03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:36.870 --> 03:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:39.150 --> 03:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chairman and members
 
03:10:41.070 --> 03:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name's Alvin C I
 
03:10:44.670 --> 03:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
live in lden and I'm uh representing
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
myself and I'm opposed to this
 
03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
myself and I'm opposed to this
bill

03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I noticed in
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is
 
03:10:57.630 --> 03:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
that while the title says it's four
 
03:11:02.190 --> 03:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
primaries on U page seven lines 4 to 12
 
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
it shows this applies to the general
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
election as well the state general
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
elections so in that case then the uh
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues with the Governor
 
03:11:17.070 --> 03:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
counselors and Senators uh May
 
03:11:20.790 --> 03:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
apply for Municipal elections this bill
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify primary or general
 
03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
election uh but since rank Choice voting
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
can supposedly handle a crowded ballot
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
this could eliminate the need for a
 
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
primary Municipal nonpartisan election
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
and this could be a major selling point
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
for going this route because that would
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for a prim primary
 
03:11:48.269 --> 03:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
election um if cities choose to do the
 
03:11:51.630 --> 03:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
rank Choice then only those cities would
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
need to replace their acuo
 
03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:57.190 align:start position:0%
need to replace their acuo
machines

03:11:57.190 --> 03:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
machines
 
03:11:59.950 --> 03:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
um and presumably that would be at the
 
03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
city's expense however if a party
 
03:12:06.750 --> 03:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
chooses to use the rank choice that
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
suddenly means that all the acuo
 
03:12:14.429 --> 03:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
machines in the state are affected and
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
therefore uh this bill really needs a
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note likely similar to the fiscal
 
03:12:22.750 --> 03:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
note on House Bill
 
03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
1482 and again for people who are
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
skeptical of computers and other
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
electronic devices uh rank Choice uh
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
voting requires much more computer use
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
and equipment and transfer of data I
 
03:12:38.550 --> 03:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
urge itl on this bill and I'll take
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for Mr
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions for Mr
C

03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
C
 
03:12:47.150 --> 03:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thanks thank
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Tiana
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
Coleman did you have anything to add on
 
03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:55.150 align:start position:0%
Coleman did you have anything to add on
this

03:12:55.150 --> 03:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill welcome thank you um I I'll keep it
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
brief I just wanted to point out really
 
03:13:04.030 --> 03:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
clearly that if you pass this
 
03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill um nothing will change unless other
 
03:13:10.590 --> 03:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
people take action so you're not
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
changing anything you're just enabling
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
giving an op in so if you pass this bill
 
03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
then municipalities are going to have to
 
03:13:19.830 --> 03:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
go through the process if they want to
 
03:13:21.630 --> 03:13:21.640 align:start position:0%
use it and pass it themselves and then
 
03:13:24.590 --> 03:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
opt in and use it if they don't do that
 
03:13:26.910 --> 03:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
nothing will change if they do they have
 
03:13:28.269 --> 03:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
that chance and a lot of them would like
 
03:13:29.950 --> 03:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
to have that chance and I think you
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
should give them that opportunity same
 
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
with primaries if you pass this bill
 
03:13:36.830 --> 03:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean there will be rank
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
Choice voting in primaries only if the
 
03:13:40.910 --> 03:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
parties want to and if one party wants
 
03:13:42.910 --> 03:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
to and another party doesn't want to
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine they don't have to both use
 
03:13:49.229 --> 03:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
it um as well as has already been
 
03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
expressed um just because they opt in
 
03:13:52.990 --> 03:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they have to keep doing it
 
03:13:55.630 --> 03:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
either and a municipality even can
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
decide because they have to when they
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
opt in they probably do it by warrant
 
03:14:00.870 --> 03:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
article or something like that and they
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
can write it however they want so if
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
they want to write it to say we're just
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
going to use it in this particular
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
primary they could or they could just
 
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
say we want to now start using it in all
 
03:14:12.229 --> 03:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
of our primaries until or unless we
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
repat kill it so this is a very open
 
03:14:18.269 --> 03:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
flexible bill it's a very conservative
 
03:14:20.150 --> 03:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
Bill once again I think representative
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
Reed kind of said it but I want to
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
repeat there is the parties have no
 
03:14:28.030 --> 03:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
right to opt in it's a federally funded
 
03:14:31.110 --> 03:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
election and the state could say we are
 
03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
going to have rank Choice voting in
 
03:14:36.670 --> 03:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
primaries and if you pass that as a bill
 
03:14:37.950 --> 03:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
then there would be rank Choice voting
 
03:14:39.910 --> 03:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
in primaries the parties do not have
 
03:14:43.150 --> 03:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
that right because you know
 
03:14:45.550 --> 03:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
parties party primaries that are funded
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
by the state and that are public
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
elections are governed by the state so
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state legislature can say what they
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to do but in this case this bill is
 
03:14:56.030 --> 03:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
giving the parties the opportunity to
 
03:14:57.309 --> 03:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
choose and opt in and they're not
 
03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
manding mandating it and so this is a a
 
03:15:02.750 --> 03:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
very conservative Bill allowing parties
 
03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
to opt in if they want or not want um
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's a side note I do think that 1482
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
can be read either way and I'm not sure
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
which which way would is right so just
 
03:15:14.790 --> 03:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that because you brought
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
that up um on the one hand it says that
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
they opt in in 2023 I'm not sure what
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
happens in 2025 and
 
03:15:23.550 --> 03:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
2027 because they don't distinguish
 
03:15:25.710 --> 03:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
between primaries and Generals so it is
 
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
possible that in 2027 it's mandated for
 
03:15:30.910 --> 03:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
all elections and it's only opt in from
 
03:15:34.750 --> 03:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
2023 till 2025 2027 but that's another
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's a side not all right thank you
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm not seeing any just
 
03:15:40.429 --> 03:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
for people coming in we are running way
 
03:15:41.950 --> 03:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
behind I'm not sure what the signage on
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
the door is we are still on the morning
 
03:15:47.670 --> 03:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
bills I anticipate that we will not be
 
03:15:50.150 --> 03:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
beginning the afternoon bills My Hope Is
 
03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
by 1:30 um but we'll see where we end up
 
03:15:56.510 --> 03:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
here the chair did not do a great job of
 
03:15:59.309 --> 03:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
scheduling this this morning also signed
 
03:16:01.389 --> 03:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
up to speak on this bill is Nathan
 
03:16:04.910 --> 03:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
Lockwood we are on Bill
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
1264 Mr Lockwood
 
03:16:10.189 --> 03:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
welcome hi Nathan Lockwood executive
 
03:16:12.110 --> 03:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
director of rank just a real brief on
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
these uh bill so I just want to
 
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate that the same type of uh voter
 
03:16:19.469 --> 03:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
candidate and election administrator
 
03:16:21.030 --> 03:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
education resources that we talked about
 
03:16:23.309 --> 03:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
being available for the state would also
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
be available for municipalities as well
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of uh Civic
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
organizations standing by ready to help
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
out with that process so I think it's a
 
03:16:33.710 --> 03:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
great opportunity um you know I think uh
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
Professor Wen referred to uh the use of
 
03:16:38.469 --> 03:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting increasingly in party
 
03:16:40.510 --> 03:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries uh just a couple
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
quick notes on that very bipartisan the
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
Democrats used it in a number of their
 
03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
primaries in 2020 for the presidency is
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
part of the way to move to a higher
 
03:16:52.110 --> 03:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
participation primary as opposed to the
 
03:16:54.189 --> 03:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
caucus system and so there were a lot of
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
states that did that the other thing I
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
would mention is New Hampshire might
 
03:16:58.269 --> 03:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
have some special benefits at least on
 
03:17:01.150 --> 03:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
the Democratic side where they are
 
03:17:03.150 --> 03:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
you're very early in the primary cycle
 
03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
for the presidency and with the
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
proportional allocation of delegates
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the that that happens in the 15%
 
03:17:11.790 --> 03:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
threshold there are historically when
 
03:17:14.429 --> 03:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
there are feels like there was in 2020 a
 
03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
lot of Voters um don't have their vote
 
03:17:19.269 --> 03:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
counted towards delegate allocation even
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
though it's supposed to be proportional
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
because they vote for someone who
 
03:17:23.070 --> 03:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't reach the threshold and rank
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
Choice voting just solves that problem
 
03:17:26.790 --> 03:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll say is tons of one of
 
03:17:28.030 --> 03:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
the things that's most exciting to rank
 
03:17:30.070 --> 03:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
Choice voting Advocates is the
 
03:17:32.429 --> 03:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
excitement amongst Republicans right now
 
03:17:34.510 --> 03:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
for rank Choice voting most notably in
 
03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
Virginia the Republican party of
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
Virginia El chose to use rank Choice
 
03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
voting to nominate their candidates for
 
03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide office because of its benefits
 
03:17:45.550 --> 03:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
and that enabled them to nominate was uh
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
a winning candidate in uh Glen yunan who
 
03:17:51.469 --> 03:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
went on to kind of an upset Victory and
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
what was thought to be a state trending
 
03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
blue and uh he partic he he was
 
03:17:57.189 --> 03:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
nominated through a rank Choice buing
 
03:18:00.030 --> 03:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
process so thanks very uh Utah is also
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
looking very closely at that and as uh
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
Professor W mentioned a lot of States
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
GOP State parties using it for their
 
03:18:10.030 --> 03:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
state conventions thanks so much thank
 
03:18:14.469 --> 03:18:14.479 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you good
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I'm a voter from Brookline
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
and an eisenh how Republican which means
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
I have no party I'm speaking in favor of
 
03:18:45.070 --> 03:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting today because I want
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
my vote to count now that I'm retired I
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
prepare for our glorious first in the
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
nation primarily by trying to see all
 
03:18:55.950 --> 03:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
the candidates Republicans Democrats and
 
03:18:59.309 --> 03:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
Bernie big job of the 50 plus candidates
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
who ran in 2020 I only managed to meet
 
03:19:02.870 --> 03:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
and greet
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
18 those half it doesn't seem believable
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
with some good ideas and a chance of
 
03:19:10.110 --> 03:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
winning so who to vote for the best the
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
likeliest someone good for the country
 
03:19:15.550 --> 03:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
or good for the people or good for me I
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
voted in like
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
53.8% of the other people who voted
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
which is more than half I didn't pick a
 
03:19:25.469 --> 03:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
winner and like
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
41.7% of Voters my candidate didn't even
 
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
get a delegate so why bother voting it's
 
03:19:34.990 --> 03:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
a waste of time and effort but if we'd
 
03:19:37.990 --> 03:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
run that primary with rank Choice voting
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
the winner would have been one of my
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
choices all voters might have said the
 
03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
same with the rank choice of voting we
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
could all feel like we've done something
 
03:19:48.389 --> 03:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
and we could all feel like we'd won
 
03:19:50.590 --> 03:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
something namely candidates with
 
03:19:50.600 --> 03:19:52.269 align:start position:0%
something namely candidates with
majority

03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
majority
 
03:19:52.279 --> 03:19:53.790 align:start position:0%
majority
support

03:19:53.790 --> 03:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:19:56.429 --> 03:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
so uh let's Empower voters by
 
03:19:59.469 --> 03:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
implementing rank Choice voting in every
 
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
election uh thanks any
 
03:20:07.990 --> 03:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:11.429 --> 03:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
choice that Miss po just showed us a
 
03:20:13.189 --> 03:20:13.199 align:start position:0%

um with I'd say five opposed and maybe
 
03:21:07.389 --> 03:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
114 but this will be part of the public
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.349 --> 03:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
review is there anybody else who wanted
 
03:21:15.870 --> 03:21:15.880 align:start position:0%

03:21:18.990 --> 03:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
1264 I'm not seeing anyone so I'm going
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing on 1264 and open
 
03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing on cacr
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
22 um this is a constitutional amendment
 
03:21:30.750 --> 03:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
providing that all elections in New
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be by rank Choice
 
03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:38.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be by rank Choice
voting

03:21:38.910 --> 03:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:42.950 --> 03:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you I was looking for it
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you uh
 
03:21:47.349 --> 03:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
election law committee for hearing me
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
today uh my name is representative Tony
 
03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
Le branch and I represent the town of
 
03:21:54.110 --> 03:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
amher I'm here to introduce cacr 22
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
which would make it a constitutional
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
requirement that all elections in New
 
03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be by rank Choice voting that
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
is all this amendment does I would like
 
03:22:03.670 --> 03:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
to clear up that RCV is already
 
03:22:05.309 --> 03:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional and that this is simply
 
03:22:07.189 --> 03:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
requires that elections be by rank
 
03:22:07.199 --> 03:22:10.150 align:start position:0%
requires that elections be by rank
Choice

03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
voting this would also give the voters
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to vote on the matter of
 
03:22:16.590 --> 03:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
RCV as all cacs in New Hampshire must be
 
03:22:19.189 --> 03:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
voted on by the voters the majority of
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony on this bill has already
 
03:22:22.590 --> 03:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
been heard so I will not be diving into
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting instead I will share
 
03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
how RCV would have affected me in my
 
03:22:30.269 --> 03:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
election if we had rank Choice voting in
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
2020 I would not be here today at least
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
not in this capacity my district is a
 
03:22:37.950 --> 03:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
purle multi-member district with three
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
members last election I came in third
 
03:22:42.030 --> 03:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
place and therefore won my seat here
 
03:22:45.150 --> 03:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
today yet there were only a there was
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
only a 74 vote difference between myself
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
and the fourth place candidate this
 
03:22:52.229 --> 03:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
meant that Democrats won all three seats
 
03:22:53.790 --> 03:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
even though my district is closer to a
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
50-50 split under a rank Choice voting
 
03:22:58.750 --> 03:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
system you would have expected voters to
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
rank their candidates first uh their
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
party's candidates first and this would
 
03:23:05.710 --> 03:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
have made it so that after two or three
 
03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
two of the three Republicans being
 
03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated it would if we're thinking of
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
this in a simple way and we assume that
 
03:23:13.469 --> 03:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
these two candidates uh voters would
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
have voted uh for another uh Republican
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh that would have meant that a
 
03:23:20.030 --> 03:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
republican would be occupying the seat
 
03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
that I am holding today with that I ask
 
03:23:24.429 --> 03:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
that the committee pass the bill with an
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
a to pass recommendation and I would
 
03:23:29.229 --> 03:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
also like to say that I would rather
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
this past than I be sitting here because
 
03:23:33.070 --> 03:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh representative
 
03:23:35.189 --> 03:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
democracy is important and I'd rather
 
03:23:36.670 --> 03:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
that uh elections be truly
 
03:23:38.670 --> 03:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative of the will of the people
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
than my personal sitting here today so
 
03:23:43.870 --> 03:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
this is more important than me and
 
03:23:45.790 --> 03:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here today thank you
 
03:23:47.590 --> 03:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative lebranch any questions
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
for the representative introducing CAC
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
R22 representative Alexander thank you I
 
03:23:55.950 --> 03:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
just I just want to add I don't think
 
03:23:57.389 --> 03:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
it's fair you could speculate on how
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
voters make decisions in in priv
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
previous elections like I understand
 
03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
moving forward but to kind of pin your
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
like the state of your race on the
 
03:24:08.750 --> 03:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
voters that previously I don't think is
 
03:24:12.389 --> 03:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
fair to the voters that's all uh I
 
03:24:15.469 --> 03:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
understand that we cannot uh accurately
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
predict how the election would have gone
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
under rank Choice voting last year as uh
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
voters did not have the opportunity to
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
use rank Choice voting but if we are
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
using uh if we're adding all the votes
 
03:24:27.189 --> 03:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
up all the Republican votes up and
 
03:24:29.710 --> 03:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
coales around one candidate it I would
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
have been eliminated in the second round
 
03:24:33.790 --> 03:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh and that would have meant that a
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
republican most likely would have
 
03:24:39.830 --> 03:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any thank you
 
03:24:46.429 --> 03:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative also signed up to speak
 
03:24:59.790 --> 03:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
C thank you madam chairman and members
 
03:25:04.189 --> 03:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
of committee my name's Alvin C I live in
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
lden and I'm here representing myself
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm opposed to this bill
 
03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh makes a change only to
 
03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
first part article
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
11 but it still leaves in place the
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional requirements in part two
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
for the Senators the governor and the uh
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
counselors and as such I think this bill
 
03:25:34.750 --> 03:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh will put a put different articles of
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
the constitution in conflict with each
 
03:25:41.309 --> 03:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
other and as such ought to be not passed
 
03:25:41.319 --> 03:25:43.590 align:start position:0%
other and as such ought to be not passed
uh

03:25:43.590 --> 03:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
also I don't think that the type of meth
 
03:25:52.630 --> 03:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
or manner of method uh of voting I don't
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
think should be specified in the
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution I I think it might be a a
 
03:26:01.189 --> 03:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
good case here to create a uh study
 
03:26:03.550 --> 03:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
committee to study all the articles of
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and see what would be
 
03:26:08.670 --> 03:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
needed to allow for changing the manner
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
how we vote but uh without specifying
 
03:26:14.429 --> 03:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
what Manner whether it's rank Choice
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
voting or approval voting or conday
 
03:26:19.950 --> 03:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
voting or any other type that might come
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
around that would be something that the
 
03:26:25.269 --> 03:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
legislature could adopt um and I thank
 
03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I will answer any
 
03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%

03:26:35.030 --> 03:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you

Tiana

03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
Coleman

03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:48.790 --> 03:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just here in my capacity as
 
03:26:50.590 --> 03:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
myself today I'm not representing any
 
03:26:53.309 --> 03:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
organization on this bill um our
 
03:26:55.389 --> 03:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
organization specifically chose to be
 
03:26:57.990 --> 03:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill some people oppose
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
it some people support it I'm I'm
 
03:27:03.550 --> 03:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
opposed um as an individual and I just
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that the reason why I
 
03:27:08.910 --> 03:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
oppose it is because my own
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional philosophy is that a
 
03:27:14.189 --> 03:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
bill that a constitution should be
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
flexible and should not go into every
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
little detail of what you want as you
 
03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
all know I support rank Choice voting
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
but I do not believe that it should be
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
mandated by the Constitution um I don't
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
believe that our constitution currently
 
03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
mandates first P the post and I don't
 
03:27:30.630 --> 03:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
think we should change it to mandate or
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know to now mandate rank Choice
 
03:27:34.030 --> 03:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
voting I think there are a lot of
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
different kinds of voting methods that
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
people could use and they should be able
 
03:27:39.389 --> 03:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
to use them without having to change the
 
03:27:40.710 --> 03:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution every time they might want
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
to use a different voting method so I I
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
do not believe we should do that um even
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
with regards to the plurality provision
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed I've already said I
 
03:27:53.510 --> 03:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe that it is constitutional but if
 
03:27:56.389 --> 03:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
we were wanting to have it be 100% sure
 
03:27:59.590 --> 03:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
no question absolutely for sure um the
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
route still wouldn't be this particular
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment you could do an amendment
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
that's much simpler that's just a
 
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
clarification kind of amendment that
 
03:28:08.750 --> 03:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
would not mandate rank Choice voting you
 
03:28:10.269 --> 03:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
do not have to mandate rank Choice
 
03:28:13.150 --> 03:28:13.160 align:start position:0%
voting in order to have that be 100% for
 
03:28:16.510 --> 03:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
sure perfect no question so that's
 
03:28:18.670 --> 03:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony thank you thank you
 
03:28:21.389 --> 03:28:21.399 align:start position:0%

03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%

cacr 15 relating to election and it
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
provides that the age to vote in the
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
primary election would be reduced to 17
 
04:03:41.070 --> 04:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
for those who will be 18 by the general
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
election joining us is to introduce the
 
04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%

and hello again house election law
 
04:03:53.550 --> 04:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh as we uh know my name is
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Tony lebranch and I
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Amherst New
 
04:03:58.510 --> 04:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I come before you today to
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
introduce cacr 15 uh this legislation
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
would do what 23 states have already
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
adopted in some form and that is 11 17y
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
olds who will be 18 by the date of the
 
04:04:10.590 --> 04:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
general election to vote in primary
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
elections it's that simple this is a
 
04:04:15.590 --> 04:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
common sense and simple modification
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
that would allow soon to be general
 
04:04:18.750 --> 04:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
election voters to Cho their pref
 
04:04:21.309 --> 04:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
preferred candidates in their primary
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the reason that this C is a cicr and
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
not a bill is because the age
 
04:04:27.070 --> 04:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
requirement to vote in all elections is
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the united is in the New Hampshire
 
04:04:31.670 --> 04:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution and is in part one article
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
11 of the Constitution and therefore a
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is required to
 
04:04:39.070 --> 04:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
make this very narrow exemption
 
04:04:40.510 --> 04:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
and with that I ask the committee pass
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
the cacr with an a to pass
 
04:04:46.309 --> 04:04:46.319 align:start position:0%

04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor is with us here to introduce the
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:41.469 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

04:06:41.469 --> 04:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
of election law committee the record my
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
name is Representative Steve Pierce and
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
I'm from Rockingham District Six which
 
04:06:48.319 --> 04:06:52.469 align:start position:0%
I'm from Rockingham District Six which
is

04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.710 --> 04:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
dairy cacr
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
19 is extraordinarily simple it's
 
04:07:00.790 --> 04:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
simple because it's something we're
 
04:07:03.590 --> 04:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
doing already the difference here though
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
is that the requirement that ballots be
 
04:07:08.149 --> 04:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
printed on paper in the state of New
 
04:07:10.349 --> 04:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a matter of law it is not
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:07:13.630 --> 04:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution and as all of us here know
 
04:07:18.510 --> 04:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
law can be changed quite simply as by
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
comparison with the Constitutional law
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
so my proposal here is to move the
 
04:07:25.070 --> 04:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of paper balloting from
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
law for those of us that follow this if
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
we got a little bit of our uh election
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
nerd on here the and we all recall that
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
the state of Iowa recently had developed
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
a smartphone app in reference to
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
their their election process that turned
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
out to be a colossal disaster so we have
 
04:07:54.149 --> 04:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
story after Story of people trying to
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
vote on machines and other creative ways
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
where there's just a slew of problems
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
and I'll touch on upon a couple of those
 
04:08:02.439 --> 04:08:03.469 align:start position:0%
and I'll touch on upon a couple of those
real

04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
real
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
quick for for those of us
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:08.149 align:start position:0%
quick for for those of us
that

04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
that are not entirely sure here let me
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
be very clear what this what this
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
proposal does and does not do this
 
04:08:13.880 --> 04:08:15.229 align:start position:0%
proposal does and does not do this
proposal

04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:08:17.710 --> 04:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
requires that we continue to vote on
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
paper this has nothing to do with how we
 
04:08:20.080 --> 04:08:21.870 align:start position:0%
paper this has nothing to do with how we
count

04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
count
 
04:08:24.429 --> 04:08:24.439 align:start position:0%
ballots and unfortunately in the media a
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
lot of times we see an interchange of
 
04:08:27.630 --> 04:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
the use of voting
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
machine interchangeably with counting
 
04:08:32.109 --> 04:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
machine and and let me be clear to to
 
04:08:33.309 --> 04:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
those watching that there's a
 
04:08:34.990 --> 04:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
substantial difference between a voting
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
machine and accounting machine a voting
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
voting machine would be me walking into
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
a a booth with a screen in front of me
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
and seeing two boxes let's say in the
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
case of a general Joe Biden Donald Trump
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
as an example of our last federal
 
04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
election and someone using that screen
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
to vote that's a voting machine a
 
04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
counting machine takes a ballot and
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
simply counts
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
votes and this bill has absolutely
 
04:09:03.070 --> 04:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with how we count votes so
 
04:09:04.269 --> 04:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that people
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
understand that this is simply about you
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
casting your vote
 
04:09:10.109 --> 04:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
for whoever whoever you choose for a
 
04:09:10.119 --> 04:09:11.149 align:start position:0%
for whoever whoever you choose for a
particular

04:09:11.149 --> 04:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:09:13.349 --> 04:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
office when uh Secretary of State
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
Gardner former now former Secretary of
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
State Gardener was asked about the
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
situation in Iowa he had a great quote
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
he said you can't hack a pencil and I
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
think that that today is something that
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
is certainly on the minds of folks after
 
04:09:31.950 --> 04:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
this last election where various things
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
were discovered or accused or or
 
04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
questioned here and the fact is is that
 
04:09:40.189 --> 04:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
when we vote on paper a lot of these
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
problems just can't
 
04:09:44.670 --> 04:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
happen the state of New Hampshire has
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
been printing ballots the state has
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
since 1892 again this is a very common
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we do in the state we don't
 
04:09:54.030 --> 04:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
really think much of it simply because
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it as a matter of law
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
for a long time so I did have a I did
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a a member asked about about this
 
04:10:03.309 --> 04:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
potentially being a 28a issue in the
 
04:10:04.590 --> 04:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
sense that the state is dictating
 
04:10:06.189 --> 04:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
something but we already do that we're
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
already requiring this as a matter of
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
law so this doesn't become a 28 issue
 
04:10:11.950 --> 04:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
because we're in in essence just moving
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
this from one section of law to
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
another so that is the gist of this it
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
it really as far as the general voting
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
public is concerned would be seamless
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:28.269 --> 04:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
difference thank
 
04:10:30.990 --> 04:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
you does anybody have any questions for
 
04:10:31.000 --> 04:10:32.870 align:start position:0%
you does anybody have any questions for
representative

04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson representative Barry I just want
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
to be very clear about this bill so this
 
04:10:39.550 --> 04:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't actually change anything
 
04:10:43.790 --> 04:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's just codifying State Statute in uh
 
04:10:46.269 --> 04:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
in in law in the Constitution and I have
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
do a followup to that question M chair
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
correct representative Barry this takes
 
04:10:53.550 --> 04:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
the the requirement to vote on paper
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
from statutory law in essence into
 
04:10:56.319 --> 04:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
from statutory law in essence into
constitutional

04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
law and that as you know is a entirely
 
04:11:06.750 --> 04:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
different level of of um how it's viewed
 
04:11:08.910 --> 04:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
in the court system and how it's the
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
ability to change that changes
 
04:11:12.030 --> 04:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
substantially once it enters the
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
Constitutional law so the um the
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office the ACU vote
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
systems are going to reach their end of
 
04:11:21.109 --> 04:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
life soon and we're going to have to
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
have some new system soon um by soon I
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
mean it's relative right it's government
 
04:11:28.109 --> 04:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
we move the speed of government
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so this would this would require that
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
any new system we had would have to have
 
04:11:38.710 --> 04:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
some form of paper receipt copy of The
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
Ballot or or something like something
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
along those lines correct
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
no you use the word receip I'm not sure
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that's what we're
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
saying here we're we're actually using
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
the term paper ballot so that means you
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
have to vote physically on the paper
 
04:11:57.630 --> 04:11:57.640 align:start position:0%
voting in another Manner and obtaining a
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
receipt is not a ballot it's a receipt
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
so there are machines out there my my
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
parents use these in my native state of
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
Texas I got to watch them vote when I
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
went home right before my birthday and
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
Christmas um where they you know Texas
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
is a very large State they vote elect
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
they vote they vote on an electronic
 
04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
machine and it prints out a copy of
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
their ballot and then they put their
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
ballot in when before they leaving they
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
basically put their ballot in as a paper
 
04:12:29.109 --> 04:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
I don't a duplicate um I don't know what
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
you want to I don't want to use the term
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
receipt um but it's you print it out you
 
04:12:34.510 --> 04:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
look at it you say yes my printed out
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
ballot looks like what I did this is the
 
04:12:37.710 --> 04:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
right thing and then you go you put it
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
in and that's how they have um basically
 
04:12:44.349 --> 04:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
gotten to the ability to count votes
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
electronically with the security of a
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
paper I don't want to use the term
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
receipt but let's say copy um so it
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
would this would this prohibit something
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
like that I don't believe so because in
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
that sense what they're what they're
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
getting out is a ballot and that ballot
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
can be questioned it can be reviewed it
 
04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
can be recounted it can be audited
 
04:13:08.710 --> 04:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
because it's a tangible
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
vote okay so in contrast to a voting
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
machine which does not produce a ballot
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
that is tangible
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
review any further
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
questions all right I'll just say in
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
followup that I've been to other places
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
who have the receipt system where you
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
vote and then you get a little ticket to
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
verify what was registered and then if
 
04:13:47.309 --> 04:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's wrong then you go back and you
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
re-enter and redo it but it's so the
 
04:13:52.510 --> 04:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
system you're talking about in Texas
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
actually has something that's tabulated
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
separate from the completion
 
04:14:02.590 --> 04:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
of what I will refer to as a ballot
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
correct I couldn't actually see it
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
because they were voting um but from the
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
way they described it to me was they
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
could actually see how they voted
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right any further
 
04:14:15.119 --> 04:14:17.109 align:start position:0%
okay all right any further
questions

04:14:17.109 --> 04:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
representatively thank you so I guess I
 
04:14:22.109 --> 04:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
should address the question to you so in
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
that circumstance that was described by
 
04:14:28.030 --> 04:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative Barry um is that really
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
the ballot or is that really a paper
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
trail for the
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
ballot and you can probably tell by my
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
question I'm a lawyer so I'm just trying
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be really clear okay sure okay so so
 
04:14:41.229 --> 04:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
this is already law in the state of New
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as far as I know we don't
 
04:14:47.309 --> 04:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
we don't do this anywhere okay and that
 
04:14:48.910 --> 04:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
may and I don't know if the Secretary of
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
State's office is here they'd be better
 
04:14:52.349 --> 04:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
to answer that question as to whether
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
that meets the intent a current law or
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
not because I don't know but there's a
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
huge difference between getting a
 
04:14:59.790 --> 04:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
receipt printed out sticking and going
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah these are who I voted for put
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
in your pocket and going home versus
 
04:15:04.750 --> 04:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
having something like representative
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
Barry described where it prints out a a
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
a a paper copy of if you will of the
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
device you used and then you turn that
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
in there's a substantial difference
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
there because something that would be
 
04:15:18.269 --> 04:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
you know akin to a receipt if you bring
 
04:15:20.670 --> 04:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
it home with you how you can't do
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
anything with it there's no recounts
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's no nothing so so I think in that
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
case is those are two very different um
 
04:15:28.910 --> 04:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
ways of conducting a
 
04:15:32.109 --> 04:15:32.119 align:start position:0%
vote representative Mir
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
Hood so you mentioned it doesn't change
 
04:15:38.670 --> 04:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
anything and the rsas RSA 656 1- a has
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
the language that this proposed
 
04:15:42.269 --> 04:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
amendment has it says for purposes of
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
facilitating the examination of
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
recounting of votes cast all elction to
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
be conducted conducted using paper
 
04:15:50.109 --> 04:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
ballots what problem does this solve why
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
is that law not good enough the reason
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
that law is not good enough is because I
 
04:15:55.149 --> 04:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
don't have faith enough that that law is
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
going to stay a law has there ever been
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
a situation in which that law was not
 
04:15:59.040 --> 04:16:00.429 align:start position:0%
a situation in which that law was not
good

04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
enough representative
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
Mirad what's the question I don't good
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
enough is not a term that an attorney
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
would be happy with use of let's leave
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
it at that I stand
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
corrected and I thank thank my Council
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
for straightening that out because I am
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
certainly not an attorney we did have a
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
memo I I think I can say somebody pop up
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
if they have a I am not aware of any
 
04:16:29.710 --> 04:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
legislative attempt to change that
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
law but I think the inference that
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson is asking us to
 
04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
draw is that it is significantly easier
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
to do that that then it is correct and
 
04:16:41.790 --> 04:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
and this was drawn the in consultation
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office I I
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
did not uh come up with this solely on
 
04:16:47.109 --> 04:16:47.119 align:start position:0%
my own this this was vetted through
 
04:16:49.550 --> 04:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
their office before it was
 
04:16:49.560 --> 04:16:51.750 align:start position:0%
their office before it was
filed

04:16:51.750 --> 04:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
filed
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
okay it's another case of politicians
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
them all right any other questions for
 
04:17:03.520 --> 04:17:05.149 align:start position:0%
them all right any other questions for
representative

04:17:05.149 --> 04:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:07.030 --> 04:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
Pearson all right thank you
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson oh I'm sorry
 
04:17:09.319 --> 04:17:11.429 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson oh I'm sorry
representative

04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
growan um thank you madam chair
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
representor Pearson it does
 
04:17:21.389 --> 04:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
say that elections shall be conducted
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
using paper ballots and it seems to me
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:17:30.189 --> 04:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
would create a stretch wouldn't it for
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
using a machine and then printing a
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
paper ballot re receipt
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
so I was going to say I don't see any
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
that I could argue both sides of that
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
one in a Flash and the other attorneys
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
but I mean if you're going to make that
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
argument Bas based on on the proposal
 
04:17:51.070 --> 04:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's before you now you you can make
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
that same argument based on current law
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you any other
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative thank
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for the
 
04:18:01.600 --> 04:18:03.109 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for the
committee's

04:18:03.109 --> 04:18:03.119 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
04:18:06.030 --> 04:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
time I do not have any other pin cards
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Terian can you see
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
please thank you my name is Liz torelli
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm from Newbury New Hampshire and I
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
compile testimony on this bill and the
 
04:18:35.070 --> 04:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
one to follow because of a misreading
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to hold that testimony for
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
the next bill but I would like to point
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
out what caused my misreading of this
 
04:18:44.710 --> 04:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
and perhaps the sponsor might want to
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
make a
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
change if you look at section five in
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
18 um I thought this was part of the
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment language and it's not
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's really about the process of putting
 
04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
it on the ballot but it does say if no
 
04:19:12.109 --> 04:19:12.119 align:start position:0%
cross is made excuse me in either of the
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
squares the ballot shall not be counted
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:19:16.239 --> 04:19:18.229 align:start position:0%
on this
question

04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
so in my quick re in my reading of it
 
04:19:23.389 --> 04:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
earlier and then I reread it this
 
04:19:25.109 --> 04:19:25.119 align:start position:0%
morning because we had a lot of spare
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
time this morning
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
sorry um I thought that imposing a cross
 
04:19:36.389 --> 04:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
rather than the ovals that we fill in
 
04:19:38.910 --> 04:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
with would lead to a requirement to do
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
hand counting because X's are much
 
04:19:46.750 --> 04:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
harder for a machine to count so I Now
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
understand that was not the intent of
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
this but that may be a suggestion to the
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor to change that language um so
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
you can put me down as neutral on this
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill I signed in AOS but neutral if that
 
04:20:05.109 --> 04:20:05.119 align:start position:0%
change is made okay so thank you for
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
allowing me to make that statement thank
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
you for pointing that
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
out any questions for Miss tentarelli
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
before she goes she's not really going
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere but she's going back to her
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
seat all right is there anybody else
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%

05:04:12.868 --> 05:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
bill or any bill that is considered by
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
the house in the upcoming session U so
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
that committee members can take account
 
05:04:19.548 --> 05:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
of that when they do their deliberations
 
05:04:22.110 --> 05:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
on the bill this is a public hearing uh
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this public hearing is to
 
05:04:27.150 --> 05:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
hear from you we want to do that um so
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
also understand that I am probably going
 
05:04:33.150 --> 05:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
to limit um testimony given the amount
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
of people that I have signed up to make
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
sure everybody can be heard um to three
 
05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
four minutes that's pretty much what we
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
get told as legislators is if you're not
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
quiet in three minutes nobody's
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
listening anymore so all right all right
 
05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
I may have to go back up to the CU all
 
05:04:53.990 --> 05:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
right all right I I may just move back
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's depending on how this goes because
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind I prefer to remain
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
standing so I can make sure I don't miss
 
05:05:02.830 --> 05:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
anybody or see what's going on um I saw
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming the hand I saw was because
 
05:05:07.230 --> 05:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
you couldn't hear me um so we have
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
resolved that and frankly once this gets
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
going you're not going to really have to
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
listen to me anymore so with that um
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
this is the election law committee I did
 
05:05:18.670 --> 05:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
not have them bring their name tags with
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
them to facilitate getting this going um
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
so without further Ado unless there are
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
other questions about procedure we're
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
going to get going and I'm going to
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor of this bill
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
he's here with us today representative
 
05:05:34.540 --> 05:05:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:34.550 --> 05:05:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
mad committee before you begin
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative just so you know one of
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
the rules of rep's Hall is that we're
 
05:05:50.910 --> 05:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
not supposed to get excited or clap or
 
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
yell because we're all a very quiet
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
Demir group um but representative
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
Allegro did a lot of work you're all
 
05:05:59.310 --> 05:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
here in support of them I recognize that
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for giving him a
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
clap but for for proceeding I'm going to
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
ask that you sort of retain that
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm a little bit because I'd like
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
to think that we give every speaker the
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
same attention um and by paying
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
attention and trying to mute our
 
05:06:16.390 --> 05:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
responses to ourselves or maybe maybe
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
our seatmate um we show everybody the
 
05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
same respect so with that thank you for
 
05:06:23.708 --> 05:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
waiting representative thank you madam
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
chair and committee members good
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon and thank you for granting me
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
the time to speak to you today I um am
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
going to present some data being mindful
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
of time considerations before I do that
 
05:06:38.830 --> 05:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to provide a little bit of
 
05:06:41.670 --> 05:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
context for this bill I would like to
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
address some of the criticisms that I
 
05:06:46.470 --> 05:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
know exist and then I'm going to present
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
a little data and summarize but first I
 
05:06:50.830 --> 05:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
do want to point out that it's really
 
05:06:53.070 --> 05:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
not fair asking an Italian to testify
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.628 --> 05:06:58.638 align:start position:0%
encumbered so I'll just do my
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
best well when I talk about this the the
 
05:07:03.548 --> 05:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
purpose purp of this bill is because
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
I've known for years and have now uh
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
confirmed with a simple data analysis
 
05:07:12.548 --> 05:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
that there are problems with voting
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
machines when I talk about this to
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
people they they roll their eyes some of
 
05:07:20.868 --> 05:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
them let me assure you this is not about
 
05:07:24.070 --> 05:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
Windham this is not really even about
 
05:07:28.030 --> 05:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
2020 this is about losing votes votes
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
being swallowed by
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
machines so um I also want to point out
 
05:07:38.670 --> 05:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
before I get rolling here uh when you
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
question me please set aside etiquette
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
and be as tough with your questions as
 
05:07:45.590 --> 05:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
you possibly can I'm prepared to defend
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
any and all data I present to you and I
 
05:07:50.070 --> 05:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
want to point out that this data has
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
been confirmed by an independent
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
source with the same outcome although a
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
completely opposite conclusion and again
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
to provide a little context a few weeks
 
05:08:04.150 --> 05:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
back a fellow from the Concord Monitor
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to um interview me the interview
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
was not going well so I uh declined
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
going further
 
05:08:14.430 --> 05:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
miraculously about two or three weeks
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
later there was an article in the
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
conquered times using the exact same
 
05:08:22.270 --> 05:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
approach that I used to do this study
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
and um he only did 2020 amazingly he
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
came out with almost exactly the same
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
numbers but in his opinion it was okay
 
05:08:34.830 --> 05:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
to throw out out some thousands of votes
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
to me not so much so um let me address
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
some criticisms first because I know the
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
real criticisms with every bill with
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
every proposal there are upsides and
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
downsides one of the commonest things
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about this particular bill
 
05:08:54.030 --> 05:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
is that it's going to cost more well
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
first of all let me tell you that uh I
 
05:08:57.788 --> 05:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
had an interesting uh interaction with
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
the U budget office and the input that
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
they received from the municipal assoc
 
05:09:06.670 --> 05:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
Association who somehow managed to not
 
05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
observe that yes there will be
 
05:09:10.670 --> 05:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
interesting uh there will be some
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
increased costs with some pole
 
05:09:16.670 --> 05:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
workers uh but and and by the way that's
 
05:09:17.948 --> 05:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
so minimal they couldn't even put a
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
number on it but there will be cost
 
05:09:22.350 --> 05:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
savings cost
 
05:09:24.990 --> 05:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
offsets Savings in not having to
 
05:09:27.390 --> 05:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
purchase machines savings and not have
 
05:09:30.590 --> 05:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
to pay for machine updates software
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
updates maintenance and that sort of
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
thing so the actual fiscal note to this
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill is almost
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
Irrelevant in my opinion anyway timing
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
timing is another criticism yes it's
 
05:09:47.310 --> 05:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
going to take longer to count the votes
 
05:09:49.548 --> 05:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
now let me point out that onethird of
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
the towns in New Hampshire already count
 
05:09:57.310 --> 05:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
by hand 2third do not and they include
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
of course as expected some of our larger
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
towns so there's going to be some added
 
05:10:04.750 --> 05:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
not only difficulty I'll be fair and say
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
hardship in this it's going to take
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
extra hours it's going to take a few
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
extra people I have a uh an acquaintance
 
05:10:15.150 --> 05:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
on the select board in Littleton and uh
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
she told me that uh the Inc the cost of
 
05:10:21.390 --> 05:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
a a stipend for a pole worker is about
 
05:10:26.590 --> 05:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
$50 for election day so if larger Towns
 
05:10:28.830 --> 05:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
how to bring on some more people truly
 
05:10:31.590 --> 05:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about a few hundred
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
every year every couple of years so yes
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
it is going to be more difficult and I
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
know that there are regulations that uh
 
05:10:41.230 --> 05:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
or there are laws that regulate how long
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
after The Ballot Box closes uh that
 
05:10:46.590 --> 05:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
towns have to report their
 
05:10:49.868 --> 05:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
numbers um I have two things to say to
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
that number one is that these other
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
hundred towns manage to do it every year
 
05:10:57.510 --> 05:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's number one number two for the
 
05:10:59.110 --> 05:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
larger towns where it's going to be more
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
difficult it may require some
 
05:11:01.080 --> 05:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
difficult it may require some
reorganization

05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
and uh last but not least look at our
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
the current state of our elections in
 
05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
this country and in the state now we
 
05:11:15.470 --> 05:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
wait hours Beyond deadlines days
 
05:11:15.480 --> 05:11:16.750 align:start position:0%
wait hours Beyond deadlines days
sometimes

05:11:16.750 --> 05:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
weeks right and in all fairness we saw
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
this play out in the presidential uh uh
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
primaries in this state and in others uh
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
we waited weeks for full results to be
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
reported so and again this is is nothing
 
05:11:34.670 --> 05:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
that can't be addressed with a simple
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill that would modify
 
05:11:40.030 --> 05:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
existing statutes if
 
05:11:42.350 --> 05:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
necessary all
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
right let me give the data and I just
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
want to present a couple of definitions
 
05:11:48.150 --> 05:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
to you so first of all here's the basis
 
05:11:49.750 --> 05:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the study that I
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
did it's almost impossible to know the
 
05:11:55.390 --> 05:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
accuracy or the Precision and in this
 
05:11:56.910 --> 05:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
case the terms are almost
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
interchangeable it's almost impossible
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
to know the accuracy of Machine versus
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
hand counting except for one special
 
05:12:06.670 --> 05:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
case and that's cases where districts
 
05:12:06.680 --> 05:12:07.590 align:start position:0%
case and that's cases where districts
are

05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
recounted because whether they're
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
initially counted by hand or by Machine
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
eventually they're recounted by hand of
 
05:12:18.548 --> 05:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
course the first thing you need to ask
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
yourself is why do we recount by hand
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
and not by Machine well the obvious
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that is because hand counting
 
05:12:29.350 --> 05:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
is more accurate to begin with it's
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
something we know already
 
05:12:35.948 --> 05:12:35.958 align:start position:0%
so what you're able to do is compare the
 
05:12:37.788 --> 05:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
original count whether it's by machine
 
05:12:40.750 --> 05:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
or hand count the same set of ballots
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
after the recount and see if there's a
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
difference between the two I call that
 
05:12:48.190 --> 05:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
difference assuming that the recount is
 
05:12:49.868 --> 05:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
the gold standard and it is the official
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
gold standard I call the recounts uh the
 
05:12:56.310 --> 05:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
the gold standard and everything is
 
05:12:59.470 --> 05:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
compared to that so when I refer to
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
error I mean the difference between the
 
05:13:04.350 --> 05:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
original count and the recount when I
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
refer to net error I there's actually a
 
05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
value assigned not only the difference
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
between them but whether that difference
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
was a gain of votes or a loss of
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
votes all
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
right Excuse me while I just run through
 
05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
my notes over here for a
 
05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
second okay now uh let me just uh lay a
 
05:13:26.788 --> 05:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
05:13:29.990 --> 05:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
groundwork when a district goes into a
 
05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
recount there are usually a few extra
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
votes picked up uh I found that this
 
05:13:38.430 --> 05:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
range is anywhere between .2 and. 3% of
 
05:13:41.788 --> 05:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
the vote and that's primarily because as
 
05:13:43.910 --> 05:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
we do a recount there are a number of
 
05:13:46.270 --> 05:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
votes that we uh we spend more time
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
deducing the voters intent so whereas a
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
little check next to a bubble might be
 
05:13:56.070 --> 05:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
thrown out in the original count in the
 
05:13:58.110 --> 05:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
recount there's a little bit more effort
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
to Define uh the intent of the voter and
 
05:14:04.190 --> 05:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
that extra vote is usually picked up so
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
usually the original count represents a
 
05:14:10.310 --> 05:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
small under count okay just by
 
05:14:12.430 --> 05:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
definition or at least for the purpose
 
05:14:12.440 --> 05:14:14.788 align:start position:0%
definition or at least for the purpose
of

05:14:14.788 --> 05:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.798 --> 05:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
today

05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
okay now I looked at the years 2016 2018
 
05:14:24.670 --> 05:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
and 2020 the only reason I didn't go
 
05:14:26.628 --> 05:14:26.638 align:start position:0%
back further uh well there's a couple of
 
05:14:28.788 --> 05:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
reasons one is because then you have to
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
start tracking when these machines were
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
brought in and and also I don't have a
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
staff as none of you do and I only have
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
so much time in a day so in 2016 there
 
05:14:41.470 --> 05:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
were 14 State Rep districts and one
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
State Senate District subjected to
 
05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
recount in 2018 it was 19 in one and in
 
05:14:50.350 --> 05:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
2020 it was 9 and two and I just
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
concentrated on State Rep and state
 
05:14:53.638 --> 05:14:55.868 align:start position:0%
concentrated on State Rep and state
senate

05:14:55.868 --> 05:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
senate
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
races all
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
right let's talk about the average error
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
per race in each year I know that some
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
of you and some of you who are not in
 
05:15:07.350 --> 05:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill are going to say but
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
these are tiny differences all right but
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
I want to tell you some information that
 
05:15:13.470 --> 05:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
was relayed to me by the Secretary of
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
State in a recent conversation I had
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
with them and it's public information
 
05:15:20.548 --> 05:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
since uh Mr Gardner was in office and we
 
05:15:22.990 --> 05:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
all know that's quite some time
 
05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
1976 there
 
05:15:24.878 --> 05:15:27.430 align:start position:0%
1976 there
were

05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
322 races in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:15:34.190 --> 05:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
32 22 elections that were
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
decided by 19 or less
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
votes so when I'm talking small numbers
 
05:15:43.470 --> 05:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
please put it into context and realize
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
that in this state especially with our
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
small State Rep
 
05:15:49.868 --> 05:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
districts five six votes can make a big
 
05:15:53.070 --> 05:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
difference all right ready for some
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
data so in
 
05:15:59.948 --> 05:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
2016 the average error was. 3% in hand
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
count towns meaning that the original
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
count was an undercount of 3% okay so
 
05:16:07.350 --> 05:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
when they recounted them the candidates
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
picked up. 3% that's in hand countdowns
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
0.7% a0 4%
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
difference sounds small not really I
 
05:16:25.470 --> 05:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
think those of you here in the no
 
05:16:27.708 --> 05:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
understand that a0 4% difference is a
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
significant difference in these races in
 
05:16:33.510 --> 05:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
2018 the average error was
 
05:16:38.030 --> 05:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
0.2% in hand count towns and 0.4% in
 
05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
machine count towns so again couple of
 
05:16:42.230 --> 05:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
tents of a percent not that big a deal
 
05:16:44.670 --> 05:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
right maybe maybe not whose vote should
 
05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
we throw out when we're talking about
 
05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
that 0.2 or Point 4% in 2020 the average
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
error was 0.7% in hand count towns and
 
05:16:57.390 --> 05:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
0.8% in machine count towns again a tiny
 
05:16:59.788 --> 05:16:59.798 align:start position:0%
error the average error per race over
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
these three election years was 6 versus
 
05:17:06.510 --> 05:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
4% anybody running for office here like
 
05:17:09.070 --> 05:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
to give up 0.2% when they come up for
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
re-election out of the gate or see that
 
05:17:12.910 --> 05:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
many votes thrown
 
05:17:15.270 --> 05:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
out my understanding is that we should
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
be aiming for every legal vote to be
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
counted and that we can't afford to
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
throw out 0.2 or
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
0.4% now in 2016 the net
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
error was a difference of
 
05:17:31.470 --> 05:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
.5% in hand can towns and machine count
 
05:17:34.350 --> 05:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
towns in other words in hand count towns
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
there was a plus a plus meaning that the
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
candidate picked up a tenth of a percent
 
05:17:43.390 --> 05:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
and in machine countdowns it was 6%
 
05:17:45.750 --> 05:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's a half a percent difference in
 
05:17:49.510 --> 05:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
2018 it was -.1 and
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
plus3 and in 2020 it was 0. 2 and 7
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
again a
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
0.5% difference if you doubt my numbers
 
05:18:00.750 --> 05:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
again I want to remind you that this was
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
confirmed independently by someone who
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
was not favorable to this
 
05:18:08.310 --> 05:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
Bill here's an interesting one for you
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
the frequency of
 
05:18:12.670 --> 05:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
Errors equal to or greater than a half a
 
05:18:12.680 --> 05:18:14.070 align:start position:0%
Errors equal to or greater than a half a
percentage

05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
point I'll summarize these three years
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
together in the three years all put put
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
together there were a 100 races now mind
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
you when I say 100 races I mean you know
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
you have a district with two towns in it
 
05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
or two jurisdictions in it and so that's
 
05:18:34.390 --> 05:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:34.400 --> 05:18:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
there

05:18:35.390 --> 05:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
were 100
 
05:18:41.350 --> 05:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
cases in the past three banial elections
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
with errors of 0.5% or
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
greater I find that
 
05:18:50.350 --> 05:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
unacceptable all
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to try to rush through
 
05:18:55.310 --> 05:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
some of this and skip over a little bit
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
here's an important
 
05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
Point 13 of those cases were in handc
 
05:19:00.558 --> 05:19:01.948 align:start position:0%
Point 13 of those cases were in handc
countdowns

05:19:01.948 --> 05:19:01.958 align:start position:0%
countdowns
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
and 87 of them were machine countdowns
 
05:19:08.548 --> 05:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
now to be fair there are more machine
 
05:19:11.030 --> 05:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
countdowns right so you would expect
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
more errors and more big errors in the
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
machine countdowns but the number is an
 
05:19:20.190 --> 05:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
over representation of that ratio right
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
if it's 1/3 to 23 we would expect there
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
to be twice as many errors but in fact
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
there was an additional 38% over
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
representation in machine
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:32.150 align:start position:0%
representation in machine
countdowns

05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
countdowns
 
05:19:36.548 --> 05:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
here's one I like each year there are
 
05:19:39.270 --> 05:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
major there's no better way to put it
 
05:19:39.280 --> 05:19:40.628 align:start position:0%
major there's no better way to put it
major

05:19:40.628 --> 05:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
major
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
screw-ups in machine count
 
05:19:45.868 --> 05:19:45.878 align:start position:0%
Towns now you know in 2020 it was
 
05:19:47.390 --> 05:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
Windham and that's what everybody likes
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
to talk to I'll bet you nobody in this
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
room knows the case of summersworth Ward
 
05:19:56.430 --> 05:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
4 in
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
2016 where the errors for six candidates
 
05:20:01.030 --> 05:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
you want to listen to what I'm saying
 
05:20:01.040 --> 05:20:01.868 align:start position:0%
you want to listen to what I'm saying
here

05:20:01.868 --> 05:20:01.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:08.430 --> 05:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
10% if that count didn't happen to be
 
05:20:10.548 --> 05:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
caught up by chance in a recounted
 
05:20:12.670 --> 05:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
district we would have never known about
 
05:20:12.680 --> 05:20:14.310 align:start position:0%
district we would have never known about
it

05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
10% error that's how accurate your
 
05:20:19.590 --> 05:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
machine counts are I'm going to repeat
 
05:20:22.470 --> 05:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
what that means the count was made by
 
05:20:25.628 --> 05:20:25.638 align:start position:0%
machine and then it was recounted and
 
05:20:28.270 --> 05:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
there was a difference of 10 and
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
11% in summersworth W 4
 
05:20:33.910 --> 05:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know about you i' call that a
 
05:20:36.270 --> 05:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
screw-up in 2018 there was no huge
 
05:20:37.830 --> 05:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
screw-up like that but the big one was
 
05:20:40.628 --> 05:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
Laconia Ward five where it was greater
 
05:20:45.310 --> 05:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
than a 2% error for four of the eight
 
05:20:47.990 --> 05:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
candidates in 2020 of course it was
 
05:20:50.270 --> 05:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
Windam where there was a net difference
 
05:20:53.430 --> 05:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
of 6% for four of the candidates and by
 
05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
the way what people don't talk about it
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
was a there was an average of a 1% error
 
05:20:59.948 --> 05:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
for the other four candidates that
 
05:21:01.868 --> 05:21:01.878 align:start position:0%
weren't involved in that whole
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:07.990 --> 05:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
screw-ups all right last page of notes
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to summarize for
 
05:21:14.590 --> 05:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
you here's the fact the unavoidable fact
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
is that machine counting leads to more
 
05:21:21.390 --> 05:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
and bigger errors than hand
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
counting the average error in machine
 
05:21:23.920 --> 05:21:25.030 align:start position:0%
counting the average error in machine
counted

05:21:25.030 --> 05:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
counted
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
towns is always greater than the average
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
error in hand-counted towns the average
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
net error for machine counted towns is
 
05:21:36.510 --> 05:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
always greater than the average net
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
error in hand counted towns the
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
frequency of Errors each year is always
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
greater in machine counted towns than in
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
handc counted towns the frequency of
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
larger errors each year is always
 
05:21:51.390 --> 05:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
greater for machine counted towns and
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
hand counted
 
05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
towns and I want to put something to you
 
05:21:57.548 --> 05:21:57.558 align:start position:0%
here I've told you how many recounts we
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
had in these few
 
05:22:02.110 --> 05:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
years 15 20
 
05:22:05.708 --> 05:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
each banum in this state there are over
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
a thousand elections that take place US
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
Senate US House president every four
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
years uh State reps County Commissioners
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
dog catchers you name it there're over a
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
thousand let's just do a little simple
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
extrapolation that means that there
 
05:22:27.000 --> 05:22:28.830 align:start position:0%
extrapolation that means that there
are

05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds hundreds of Elections each year
 
05:22:34.350 --> 05:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
in this state and will never be able to
 
05:22:37.150 --> 05:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
know which ones they were or how they
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
might have turned out hundreds of
 
05:22:41.470 --> 05:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
Elections with errors of this kind of
 
05:22:41.480 --> 05:22:43.110 align:start position:0%
Elections with errors of this kind of
magnitude

05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
magnitude
 
05:22:47.830 --> 05:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
0.5% 1% 4%
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
10% will'll never know because they
 
05:22:50.558 --> 05:22:57.310 align:start position:0%
10% will'll never know because they
weren't

05:22:57.310 --> 05:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.830 --> 05:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
recounted given these inaccuracies it
 
05:23:01.628 --> 05:23:01.638 align:start position:0%
means that every election we're
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
literally throwing out our citizens
 
05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
votes there's no way to know how many
 
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
true somebody might say well but these
 
05:23:17.548 --> 05:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
have't you know like in in 20120 this
 
05:23:20.350 --> 05:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
didn't result in any reversals but it
 
05:23:22.750 --> 05:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
does it does occasionally and again
 
05:23:24.430 --> 05:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
we'll never know how many reversals
 
05:23:25.868 --> 05:23:25.878 align:start position:0%
there might have been I'm not going to
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
sit here and try to describe to you what
 
05:23:29.390 --> 05:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
if the race was this close or this close
 
05:23:31.430 --> 05:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
or this close and it was recounted
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
whether we would have seen the a
 
05:23:34.430 --> 05:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
reversal but there were two districts
 
05:23:37.150 --> 05:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
recounted in 2016 and 2018 where there
 
05:23:39.990 --> 05:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
were rever reversals uh no I'm sorry
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
they resulted in five position reversals
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and in four election reversals when I
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
say aition AOS reversal somebody that
 
05:23:51.150 --> 05:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
finished outside of the uh running
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
flipped with another candidate so it
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
didn't result in an overturning of that
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
election but it was still a position
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
reversal so there were actually Four
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
election reversals in those two years
 
05:24:04.990 --> 05:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
years they were all in machine counted
 
05:24:07.948 --> 05:24:07.958 align:start position:0%
districts none in hand-counted
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
District so I just want to conclude and
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
then I'll be very pleased to take any
 
05:24:15.948 --> 05:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
questions by
 
05:24:18.270 --> 05:24:18.280 align:start position:0%
saying we're concerned about election
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
Integrity in this nation and in this
 
05:24:23.788 --> 05:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
state and we should
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
be we didn't have to change
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
rooms because people are confident in
 
05:24:31.470 --> 05:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
elections in this state
 
05:24:32.990 --> 05:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to move over here because
 
05:24:34.350 --> 05:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy with the way things
 
05:24:34.360 --> 05:24:35.910 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy with the way things
are

05:24:35.910 --> 05:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
going it's our responsibility and it
 
05:24:41.628 --> 05:24:41.638 align:start position:0%
should be our desire to count every
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
vote and
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
to imbue confidence in our
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
citizenry that our elections are fair
 
05:24:52.910 --> 05:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
and free and that their vote is being
 
05:24:55.070 --> 05:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
counted and I'll end with that and I'd
 
05:24:57.230 --> 05:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
be very pleased to take any questions
 
05:24:58.948 --> 05:24:58.958 align:start position:0%

05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent ative please
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
hold your
 
05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
applause he got one good clap before
 
05:25:07.708 --> 05:25:07.718 align:start position:0%
does anybody on the committee have any
 
05:25:09.390 --> 05:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
05:25:09.400 --> 05:25:14.990 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
representative

05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:18.510 --> 05:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hamlet um thank you madam chair and
 
05:25:21.150 --> 05:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
05:25:24.430 --> 05:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh can you tell me how
 
05:25:27.548 --> 05:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
many voters are in those hand count
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
towns either an average or the range of
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
what what's the population of the can
 
05:25:35.230 --> 05:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
count towns okay it was a little hard
 
05:25:36.470 --> 05:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
for me to understand you so I'm going to
 
05:25:38.230 --> 05:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
try to repeat your question I think you
 
05:25:40.030 --> 05:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
were asking how many voters are in these
 
05:25:42.628 --> 05:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
different towns in the hand in the hand
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
counted towns I don't have that number
 
05:25:45.788 --> 05:25:45.798 align:start position:0%
obviously you know I'll be happy to
 
05:25:47.390 --> 05:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
concede that the handc counted towns
 
05:25:49.548 --> 05:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
that are currently in the state are the
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
smallest jur smaller jurisdictions for
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
instance you know whatever I it's it's
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
not important really because there's a
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
simple fix for this in towns with larger
 
05:26:00.080 --> 05:26:01.150 align:start position:0%
simple fix for this in towns with larger
population

05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know that it's just a management
 
05:26:05.948 --> 05:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
issue to decide okay you six people
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
count here you six people count here you
 
05:26:11.390 --> 05:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
know so it's a management issue and by
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
the way if this had to be phased in over
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
a year or two uh so that uh
 
05:26:18.510 --> 05:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities could react to those
 
05:26:20.310 --> 05:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems I think that would be
 
05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
a really fair uh request and amendment
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be made did I answer your question
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you very
 
05:26:29.788 --> 05:26:29.798 align:start position:0%
much further questions from committee
 
05:26:29.798 --> 05:26:31.390 align:start position:0%
much further questions from committee
members

05:26:31.390 --> 05:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:26:31.400 --> 05:26:35.708 align:start position:0%
members
representative

05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
Barry I know we're having trouble
 
05:26:40.350 --> 05:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
hearing um thank you for your testimony
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
um I have to uh in these situations as
 
05:26:45.310 --> 05:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
you're aware um I'm one of the loudest
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
voices for voter Integrity on this
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not the only one um
 
05:26:52.110 --> 05:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's many of us um but you
 
05:26:54.310 --> 05:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
know when I when I think about this
 
05:26:56.830 --> 05:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
procedurally um that's when I start
 
05:27:00.270 --> 05:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
asking questions right um so I looked up
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
in your election you won by 50 votes
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
there was 2,000 some odd 275 cast right
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
and it appears that your um opponent
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
didn't ask for a recount right so you're
 
05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
I assume you're a hand count Town 2,000
 
05:27:14.750 --> 05:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
votes how we no we're a machine count
 
05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
machine count town so is it possible
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
that your election was outside of these
 
05:27:21.070 --> 05:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
margin of
 
05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
Errors um I'm not I'm not sure what you
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
mean by outside of the margin of AR well
 
05:27:28.470 --> 05:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
you gave a you gave an average you're a
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
machine count town right so oh my
 
05:27:33.990 --> 05:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
district yeah my district if the if the
 
05:27:36.510 --> 05:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
error was only 0 2 or Point let me
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
rephrase that if the difference if the
 
05:27:39.868 --> 05:27:39.878 align:start position:0%
error was only 2
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
34% .5% it would not have affected the
 
05:27:46.430 --> 05:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
outcome of my election
 
05:27:49.390 --> 05:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay but that's this year who knows
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
about the year before who knows what the
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
error was the year before there's no way
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
to know so in in my I have a floal
 
05:27:55.868 --> 05:27:55.878 align:start position:0%
district I represent question
 
05:27:57.868 --> 05:27:57.878 align:start position:0%
representative Barry yes I have a I
 
05:28:00.670 --> 05:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
represent over 28 almost 29,000 people
 
05:28:02.190 --> 05:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
in South Manchester in the town of
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
Lichfield um I live in Ward n um which
 
05:28:08.310 --> 05:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
is a it's becoming Republican but it's a
 
05:28:11.190 --> 05:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
still a Democrat leaning Ward um and
 
05:28:12.430 --> 05:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
then I represent w 8 in the town of
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
Lichfield which both tend to lean
 
05:28:18.548 --> 05:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
Republican in my election I beat my
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
opponent um she won ward nine um I beat
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
the other Democrat running um but I got
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
second to her in the ward um she was
 
05:28:29.310 --> 05:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
super excited about losing to me um and
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
she ran for selectman now for those of
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
you who don't live in city government uh
 
05:28:35.830 --> 05:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
in city government a selectman does not
 
05:28:37.788 --> 05:28:37.798 align:start position:0%
rule over the city the selectman counts
 
05:28:40.590 --> 05:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
ballots so under your proposal the
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
person who not a big fan of mine um is
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
going to be counting my ballots and
 
05:28:48.708 --> 05:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's where I think we need to find
 
05:28:51.708 --> 05:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
some form of compromise because bluntly
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
I don't trust her I did not vote for her
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
for select me by the way um but I think
 
05:28:56.990 --> 05:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
if you were in my shoes you probably
 
05:28:58.310 --> 05:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
would also feel the same way would you
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
not I I I miss the L words I'm sorry so
 
05:29:04.548 --> 05:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
so you're you're asking me right to have
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
my previous opponent who I have beaten
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
count my votes in the next election yes
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
that's right and and so here's the issue
 
05:29:14.030 --> 05:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
is that one advantage of this that's not
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
discussed is that it could allow for I
 
05:29:18.470 --> 05:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean you know you can make every it's a
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
half full half empty argument the half
 
05:29:23.708 --> 05:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
full argument is that we can evolve more
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
citizens in this in this process so all
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
right all right okay representative
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
Allegro is going to be excused from the
 
05:29:36.868 --> 05:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
mic if the Clapping continues so keep
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
that in mind please it's okay please
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
these are the regular rules of the house
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
and so I ask that we abide by them so um
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it could provide for more uh
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
involvement citizens again I understand
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to be easy getting
 
05:29:54.590 --> 05:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
people involved in elections although
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
you might find it different now if you
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
can judge by what you're seeing today
 
05:30:00.430 --> 05:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
you might find it different now but
 
05:30:04.310 --> 05:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
getting people involved in the wearisome
 
05:30:06.070 --> 05:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
project of counting votes is not going
 
05:30:09.070 --> 05:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
to be easy so yes we're going to have to
 
05:30:10.868 --> 05:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
hire some more poll workers or poll
 
05:30:14.510 --> 05:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers who get small stipend again
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
here's the bottom line uh representative
 
05:30:19.230 --> 05:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
and and it's a it's the toughest part of
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
this whole thing I willingly admit the
 
05:30:24.670 --> 05:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
toughest part is the time and the
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
Manpower but my answer to that is if
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
this was going to be bloody murder and
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
and not just a
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
discomfort the question is still are we
 
05:30:36.430 --> 05:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to make accurate counts in our
 
05:30:39.150 --> 05:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
votes do we want fast or do we want
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
accurate so I I very much appreciate
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
could a compromise be reached um I
 
05:30:47.230 --> 05:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
suppose I need to think about that and
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
if anybody in the committee or in the
 
05:30:50.948 --> 05:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
house has some good ideas I'd be Tickle
 
05:30:53.150 --> 05:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
Pink to work with you and try to bring
 
05:30:55.708 --> 05:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
it to something that's less painful but
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
more accurate honestly so please
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
do thank you further questions for
 
05:31:01.160 --> 05:31:04.350 align:start position:0%
do thank you further questions for
representative

05:31:04.350 --> 05:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.070 --> 05:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
O'Brien good afternoon thank you for
 
05:31:15.070 --> 05:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
that presentation in in our state the
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting machines are
 
05:31:22.510 --> 05:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
enacted by and purchased by the
 
05:31:25.708 --> 05:31:25.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that's who decides
 
05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
that they can remain in use so if a
 
05:31:30.990 --> 05:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
community doesn't want electronic ballot
 
05:31:31.000 --> 05:31:32.510 align:start position:0%
community doesn't want electronic ballot
counting

05:31:32.510 --> 05:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
counting
 
05:31:35.310 --> 05:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
machines citizens can
 
05:31:37.788 --> 05:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
apply they can they can petition their
 
05:31:43.150 --> 05:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
own leaders to to discontinue their use
 
05:31:44.910 --> 05:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
have you done this in your own community
 
05:31:46.990 --> 05:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
and has that been effective and do you
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
think that this this P this situation
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
that we have now is ineffective well
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
actually there are two two parts your
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to answer the second
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
part first and that is it is my
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that people in my district
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
are indeed introducing a a petition
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article and I know it's
 
05:32:07.868 --> 05:32:07.878 align:start position:0%
happening around the state but to the
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
first part of your question in the US
 
05:32:13.390 --> 05:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution the state legislators have
 
05:32:15.230 --> 05:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
the power to enact the means and the
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
timing and so forth of of Elections so
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
we do have the authority to do it um
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
this isn't a matter of um
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
Town um officials being able to able to
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
overrule a state um election law uh it
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
would be nice if they all
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
did um but we'll still face problems in
 
05:32:38.548 --> 05:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
some of our larger
 
05:32:40.990 --> 05:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
towns did did I answer your question
 
05:32:43.830 --> 05:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.030 --> 05:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
hope I'll be happy to take it in a
 
05:32:48.830 --> 05:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
different form if if I didn't any other
 
05:32:50.750 --> 05:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members and I'm
 
05:32:52.590 --> 05:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
sure the representative would be open to
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
receiving questions individually after
 
05:32:57.628 --> 05:32:57.638 align:start position:0%

see if the town would eliminate our
 
05:34:22.510 --> 05:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.190 --> 05:34:27.200 align:start position:0%

05:34:38.190 --> 05:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity
 
05:34:40.390 --> 05:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
our town
 
05:34:45.390 --> 05:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
clerk Marge Morgan was the former
 
05:34:49.190 --> 05:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
chair of the Town clerks
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%

every town chair a town clerk in the
 
05:35:01.670 --> 05:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
state and uh
 
05:35:04.948 --> 05:35:04.958 align:start position:0%
saw this response in
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
Greenland and she is getting questions
 
05:35:10.548 --> 05:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
from many Town chairs about how this
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
happened and uh what what that
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
means the I'm a former selectman in
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
barington New
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I my third term in
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
Greenland the state uh state house in
 
05:35:29.830 --> 05:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
here so there are a lot of other facts
 
05:35:31.390 --> 05:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
and figures I could give you but I think
 
05:35:33.150 --> 05:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
the what I would like to leave you with
 
05:35:37.270 --> 05:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
this 90% of the
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
voters of the
 
05:35:46.390 --> 05:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
66% registered voters in Greenland
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
rejected this idea
 
05:35:56.910 --> 05:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
outright so that is uh one one
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
example and I can only speak on behalf
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
of green I cannot project that out to
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state and I don't
 
05:36:05.868 --> 05:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
pretend to I can also tell
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
you that our town election officials
 
05:36:10.948 --> 05:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good handle on uh what
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
they think the turnout's going to be we
 
05:36:16.430 --> 05:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
printed 700 ballots another 300 needed
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
to be printed that day to accommodate
 
05:36:21.230 --> 05:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
everybody who came to the polls those
 
05:36:23.270 --> 05:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
300 then need to be counted by hand and
 
05:36:26.948 --> 05:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
they were that day one warant art one
 
05:36:29.470 --> 05:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
item on that ballot if you could wrap it
 
05:36:31.070 --> 05:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
up it took
 
05:36:34.350 --> 05:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative an hour and a half for
 
05:36:37.150 --> 05:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
those pole workers to count that and to
 
05:36:40.030 --> 05:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
make sure it was accurate so what does
 
05:36:42.990 --> 05:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
that mean when we have warant articles
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
in March where you have multiple
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
pages of ballots and
 
05:36:51.390 --> 05:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
candidates and I'll thank you very much
 
05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'll end it with that thank you for your
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative also also signed up to
 
05:37:03.230 --> 05:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill is Judy Laughner do I
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
have that right Julie there you are come
 
05:37:15.510 --> 05:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:19.750 --> 05:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
here hi I'm Julie lochner I live in
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
Raymond um after I heard about the
 
05:37:25.708 --> 05:37:25.718 align:start position:0%
Windom results I checked the machines in
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
my town in Raymond we have three
 
05:37:32.548 --> 05:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
machines and to me machine 3 looked very
 
05:37:34.830 --> 05:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
different than machine 1 and
 
05:37:38.070 --> 05:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
two um just for an example for the
 
05:37:40.750 --> 05:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
presidential race in November 2020
 
05:37:45.548 --> 05:37:45.558 align:start position:0%
machine one had 31% for Biden on machine
 
05:37:48.670 --> 05:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
one and two and 62 and a
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
half% on machine number three and that
 
05:37:56.430 --> 05:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
was the same way down the whole ballot
 
05:37:59.110 --> 05:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
for machine number three so I did go to
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
my Elman and I made it clear that I
 
05:38:07.070 --> 05:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
trust the officials in my town but I had
 
05:38:10.230 --> 05:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions about the machines because of
 
05:38:12.190 --> 05:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
the way the numbers look and because of
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
what happened in
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
Windom and they weren't very interested
 
05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
they said it was too expensive and it
 
05:38:23.788 --> 05:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
would take too much time basically so
 
05:38:25.230 --> 05:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
some of us said well how about if we do
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
a recount no you can't there's the state
 
05:38:31.110 --> 05:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
laws against that it's too late well how
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
about if we on the next election how
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
about if we hand count and machine count
 
05:38:38.468 --> 05:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
just to check the machines no you're not
 
05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that state rules so at
 
05:38:44.190 --> 05:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
this point this feels like it's our only
 
05:38:47.230 --> 05:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
recourse that we get rid of the machines
 
05:38:49.230 --> 05:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
so that the people feel confident that
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
their votes are counted thank
 
05:38:57.510 --> 05:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you all right no applause
 
05:38:59.948 --> 05:38:59.958 align:start position:0%
please everybody deserves your same

major issue in the United States right
 
05:39:59.070 --> 05:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
now and I'm going to divert to another
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
area area where we where we need
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
trust we have in the state a Division of
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
Weights and measures what do those
 
05:40:07.798 --> 05:40:08.788 align:start position:0%
Weights and measures what do those
people

05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:40:13.548 --> 05:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
do 20,000 different devices are under
 
05:40:15.548 --> 05:40:15.558 align:start position:0%
the divisional weights and
 
05:40:19.788 --> 05:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
measures um 300 and
 
05:40:23.788 --> 05:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
3,200 businesses are supervised by
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
Division of Weights and
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
measures over 260 people are certified
 
05:40:35.230 --> 05:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
as testers Checkers inspectors by that
 
05:40:38.070 --> 05:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
division why are they doing that why am
 
05:40:41.310 --> 05:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
I why am I talking about that because we
 
05:40:44.830 --> 05:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
need to have faith that the weight of
 
05:40:47.628 --> 05:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
the things that we buy the pump that
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
pumps our gas is pumping one gallon not
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
less and we've set up a system to ensure
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of those machines
 
05:40:59.878 --> 05:41:00.788 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of those machines
and

05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%

in New Hampshire and most of New England
 
05:41:56.670 --> 05:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
deals with these machines it's entirely
 
05:42:00.310 --> 05:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
left in their hands now there is a very
 
05:42:02.750 --> 05:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
small guidance document that was written
 
05:42:02.760 --> 05:42:03.788 align:start position:0%
small guidance document that was written
in

05:42:03.788 --> 05:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
2010 by the Secretary of

State uh in response to the ballot
 
05:42:12.910 --> 05:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
commission saying you need some guidance
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
here and it tells a town clerk how to
 
05:42:18.788 --> 05:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
deal with these
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
issues we recently had a member of One
 
05:42:25.070 --> 05:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
of a constituent in one of my towns
 
05:42:28.350 --> 05:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
Kensington El brandano he is here today
 
05:42:32.110 --> 05:42:32.120 align:start position:0%

05:42:33.990 --> 05:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
working in the town of Kensington
 
05:42:35.628 --> 05:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to ask that you

try to wrap it up it's been over we'll
 
05:42:42.030 --> 05:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
do thank you the the the bottom line is
 
05:42:45.830 --> 05:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
is it did not work at all many many
 
05:42:48.510 --> 05:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
problems associated with that no militia
 
05:42:52.548 --> 05:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
intent was identified but big problems
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
so my focus here is to
 
05:42:59.310 --> 05:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
focus the issue on trust if you want
 
05:43:01.548 --> 05:43:01.558 align:start position:0%
trust in this election if people are
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%

these results you heard the results from

Mark hand count is the highest most
 
05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
trustworthy way to do election
 
05:43:17.628 --> 05:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
counting happy to take questions
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%

05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
record um I'm coming here today in
 
05:44:04.590 --> 05:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
support of getting the machines out of
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
our state um I
 
05:44:11.430 --> 05:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh some of you folks may not remember
 
05:44:16.070 --> 05:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
the um Fiasco in the 2000 election um
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
not in our state but uh in the federal
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
election that's when the trust in our
 
05:44:24.270 --> 05:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
election process began to go downhill
 
05:44:26.468 --> 05:44:26.478 align:start position:0%
and has been increasingly go going
 
05:44:28.750 --> 05:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
downhill over the years we currently
 
05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
have 30 towns that will be having
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
warrant articles on their ballots in
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
March to get the machines out that's
 
05:44:39.070 --> 05:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
pretty impressive seeing that we had
 
05:44:40.990 --> 05:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
less than 24 hours to get those warrant
 
05:44:43.948 --> 05:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
articles in place um second of all I'd
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
like to speak a little bit um about the
 
05:44:47.638 --> 05:44:49.310 align:start position:0%
like to speak a little bit um about the
Greenland

05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
Greenland
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
Fiasco um that um representative spoke
 
05:44:56.708 --> 05:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
about I actually know a number of people
 
05:44:58.590 --> 05:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
in Greenland who thought they were
 
05:45:01.190 --> 05:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
voting to get the machine out or they
 
05:45:04.030 --> 05:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
thought if they voted if they voted to
 
05:45:06.310 --> 05:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
get the machines out they made the clerk
 
05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
look bad and they trust their Clerk and
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
they trust their elected representatives
 
05:45:13.070 --> 05:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is Greenland might be
 
05:45:15.830 --> 05:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
an outlier but as you can see here today
 
05:45:19.468 --> 05:45:19.478 align:start position:0%
we don't trust too many of our elected
 
05:45:21.548 --> 05:45:21.558 align:start position:0%
representatives anymore we have gotten
 
05:45:24.788 --> 05:45:24.798 align:start position:0%
to the point where we have said show me
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
the proof I don't trust you folks
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
anymore I have been here every day day
 
05:45:31.468 --> 05:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
since January 5th I've been either at
 
05:45:34.150 --> 05:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
Double Tree or here speaking and paying
 
05:45:36.670 --> 05:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
attention and I am getting everyone
 
05:45:39.948 --> 05:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
around me to speak and pay attention to
 
05:45:42.430 --> 05:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
what our elected officials are doing and
 
05:45:44.910 --> 05:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
what we're allowing to happen not only
 
05:45:48.350 --> 05:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
in our in our local and state government
 
05:45:50.430 --> 05:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
but what's happening with our machines
 
05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
our machines cannot be trusted they
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
never should have been trusted um and uh
 
05:45:58.190 --> 05:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
there's been problems for years for
 
05:46:01.230 --> 05:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
folks that don't have the statistical um
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
I was trying to look up everyone's Town
 
05:46:05.110 --> 05:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's up here or town or city to see
 
05:46:07.070 --> 05:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
how many voters you have so you could
 
05:46:10.830 --> 05:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
get the the figure on the on the average
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
so the best way to do it is to take your
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
to take your voter population take um
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
10% 10% of that voter population and
 
05:46:24.590 --> 05:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
divide it by half that's how many votes
 
05:46:28.468 --> 05:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
were wrong just in your C your county or
 
05:46:28.478 --> 05:46:30.030 align:start position:0%
were wrong just in your C your county or
District

05:46:30.030 --> 05:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
District
 
05:46:32.310 --> 05:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
that should make everybody go
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
what and if it doesn't then shame on all
 
05:46:38.190 --> 05:46:38.200 align:start position:0%

05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
town I am a bu or I was a business owner
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
here in the state for for 12 years I
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
have been a group controller of a
 
05:47:08.750 --> 05:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
billion doll business I run aund Million
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
doll business today and I'm on a board
 
05:47:12.750 --> 05:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
of directors of the largest employee
 
05:47:15.868 --> 05:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
owned company I'm a mother of four kids
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
three in the military who are serving
 
05:47:20.708 --> 05:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
right now and I am a grandmother of
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
eight and so I'm here to talk from all
 
05:47:25.708 --> 05:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
of those vectors the first thing I would
 
05:47:27.750 --> 05:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
like to say is that I was never
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
politically active but over the past two
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
years I've kind of had an Awakening and
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
it's been a gradual process but the
 
05:47:37.510 --> 05:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
election process was my big Awakening
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
and it catapulted me into becoming a
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
participant in um a citizen uh citizens
 
05:47:47.628 --> 05:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
audit for a Statewide audit for New
 
05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and through that process I led
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
the canvasing effort as well as did a
 
05:47:55.948 --> 05:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
personal evaluation of at least 100 plus
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
of our Town's uh machine performance
 
05:48:01.468 --> 05:48:01.478 align:start position:0%
so on the machine performance I will
 
05:48:04.150 --> 05:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that when you look town by town
 
05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
you will find anomalies where at least
 
05:48:09.788 --> 05:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
uh one if not two or three of the
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
machines perform out of statistical um a
 
05:48:16.270 --> 05:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
statistical normaly to what the
 
05:48:19.510 --> 05:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
registered voter um uh uh profile looks
 
05:48:21.788 --> 05:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
like so as a citizen who would like to
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
go further to look at how that could
 
05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
happen we have no access to root data
 
05:48:28.350 --> 05:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
which of course are the ballots we have
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
no access to those the second thing I
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
would like to say is that from a
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
canvasing perspective we have found that
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
on the doors we've knocked at least
 
05:48:39.628 --> 05:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to 15% of the people
 
05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
that were voters on our on the day of
 
05:48:45.110 --> 05:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
the election did not vote or were in
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
another capacity they voted either
 
05:48:48.310 --> 05:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
absentee when they should have voted in
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
person and vice versa so with all of
 
05:48:53.708 --> 05:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
this I found myself in that same group
 
05:48:56.430 --> 05:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
of people the same group of people that
 
05:48:59.948 --> 05:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
uh show up now is 50% who don't trust
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
our election process and we need to
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
trust our election process I have sons
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
that are serving to fight for our right
 
05:49:10.750 --> 05:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
for having our voices heard and it is
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
shocking to me that we would allow
 
05:49:16.468 --> 05:49:16.478 align:start position:0%
machines to R wipe away the voices of
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire whether it
 
05:49:22.030 --> 05:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
be by accident or by Mal feance as a
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
business owner and as somebody who ran
 
05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
large Finance departments the lack of
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
business controls that happens around
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
those Mach machines within our state is
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
astounding to me no business owner would
 
05:49:36.948 --> 05:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
ever allow a third party to manage their
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
bank accounts without audit without
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
visibility into what goes on in the bank
 
05:49:45.468 --> 05:49:45.478 align:start position:0%
they would want to complete in total
 
05:49:47.468 --> 05:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
reconciliation of everything that's
 
05:49:50.830 --> 05:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
going on and we have absolutely no
 
05:49:53.350 --> 05:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
transparency if you want to know the
 
05:49:55.150 --> 05:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
absolute count of what went through the
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
machine you have to have a recount if
 
05:49:58.750 --> 05:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
you have if you want to make make sure
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
it ties out without that there is no in
 
05:50:04.230 --> 05:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
Integrity in the numbers that we as
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire can believe in
 
05:50:08.190 --> 05:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
so we are here today loud and clear to
 
05:50:10.830 --> 05:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
say we want the machines out we want
 
05:50:13.070 --> 05:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
hand count and we want to restore the
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
trust in the vote of New Hampshire thank
 
05:50:21.150 --> 05:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
you Kelly
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
Penza Kelly Kelly Penza are you
 
05:50:30.350 --> 05:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
here anybody know who Kelly is is she
 
05:50:39.310 --> 05:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's hard to say this in
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
three minutes I'm just going to really
 
05:50:46.190 --> 05:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
talk about Windam the Windam audit in s
 
05:50:49.750 --> 05:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
sp43 um because we spent there's many
 
05:50:52.110 --> 05:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
many people in this room that spent
 
05:50:54.788 --> 05:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
hundreds and thousands of hours on that
 
05:50:58.030 --> 05:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
um and so really if you ever if anybody
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
read report that came out it showed that
 
05:51:00.320 --> 05:51:01.350 align:start position:0%
read report that came out it showed that
the

05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
machines were a problem foldgate we know
 
05:51:07.990 --> 05:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
that there was inaccuracies if every
 
05:51:09.990 --> 05:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
vote is not counted then that's a
 
05:51:12.150 --> 05:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
problem and Wen made a lot of mistakes
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we know that there's aund and some
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
odd page report but I'd love everybody
 
05:51:18.150 --> 05:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
to know because this is an article that
 
05:51:21.468 --> 05:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
was written by myself and my very good
 
05:51:23.430 --> 05:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
friend Sarah
 
05:51:26.590 --> 05:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
iban all of the public officials on the
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
house election law committee knew knew
 
05:51:31.350 --> 05:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
in advance that the folds were going to
 
05:51:33.510 --> 05:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
be a problem and they did nothing about
 
05:51:36.910 --> 05:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
it the chair of the election house law
 
05:51:39.990 --> 05:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee knew it and did nothing we
 
05:51:41.868 --> 05:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
could have spent a little bit of extra
 
05:51:44.990 --> 05:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
money to have no folds in our ballets to
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that all our votes were
 
05:51:48.830 --> 05:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
counted but we didn't want to do that
 
05:51:50.510 --> 05:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Penza your testimony is to the
 
05:51:53.468 --> 05:51:53.478 align:start position:0%

our ballots that's got the the the
 
05:53:07.070 --> 05:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
memory cards it's crazy no one would

ever do that and you guys all knew about
 
05:53:12.910 --> 05:53:12.920 align:start position:0%

05:53:35.670 --> 05:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
three minutes and it has occurred to me

over to the last section over here as
 
05:58:17.590 --> 05:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
compared to where the mass people are um
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%

05:59:18.990 --> 05:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and town clerk
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
Association and we respectfully request
 
05:59:23.708 --> 05:59:23.718 align:start position:0%
that you itail this bill we are opposed
 
05:59:26.110 --> 05:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
to this bill for many reasons machine
 
05:59:28.030 --> 05:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
counts have been found to be be more
 
05:59:31.030 --> 05:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
accurate than hand counts as eviden in
 
05:59:32.830 --> 05:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
almost every recount conducted by the
 
05:59:34.750 --> 05:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office it is
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
usually the hand count towns that have
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
the largest discrepancies the machines
 
05:59:42.310 --> 05:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
we use are the most basic of devices
 
05:59:43.948 --> 05:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
they are only reading the marks on the
 
05:59:46.468 --> 05:59:46.478 align:start position:0%
ballot they are not connected to the
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
internet and the programming is very
 
05:59:51.830 --> 05:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
basic hand counts would require a
 
05:59:53.750 --> 05:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
battery of election officials to be on
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
hand at the end of a 16 to 17-hour day
 
05:59:59.150 --> 05:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
to have them sit down and count for
 
06:00:01.628 --> 06:00:01.638 align:start position:0%
another six to 10 hours is Not
 
06:00:04.628 --> 06:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
Practical um in Milford for example we
 
06:00:04.638 --> 06:00:05.788 align:start position:0%
Practical um in Milford for example we
have

06:00:05.788 --> 06:00:05.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
over in 2020 we had 10,000 ballots on a
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
a town election will we can have close
 
06:00:14.910 --> 06:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
to 15,000 ballots that need to be
 
06:00:17.350 --> 06:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
counted um we would
 
06:00:21.628 --> 06:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
need we have approximately 200 over 200
 
06:00:23.230 --> 06:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
volunteers that day we would need
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
another 150 volunteers to hand count
 
06:00:28.150 --> 06:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
that night the election budgets for
 
06:00:30.750 --> 06:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
workers would triple or more finding
 
06:00:33.670 --> 06:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
election workers would also be very
 
06:00:35.150 --> 06:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
difficult for many cities and towns
 
06:00:37.150 --> 06:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
therefore five for leading to a much
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
longer time to complete the counting
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
going to hand count would be like
 
06:00:43.868 --> 06:00:43.878 align:start position:0%
telling the Automobile Association to go
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
back to building cars manually and
 
06:00:48.510 --> 06:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the machines machines
 
06:00:50.948 --> 06:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
have been found over and over in many
 
06:00:52.910 --> 06:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
disciplines to be far more accurate than
 
06:00:55.230 --> 06:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
humans why would we want to go back in
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
time and I I attached an article written
 
06:01:01.628 --> 06:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
by um recently by David Brooks that
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
where he did a little study on the
 
06:01:06.430 --> 06:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
Machine versus hand count accuracy if
 
06:01:08.110 --> 06:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
06:01:10.190 --> 06:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you does anybody on the
 
06:01:11.350 --> 06:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
committee have any
 
06:01:13.468 --> 06:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any thank you
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
very much for coming in your written
 
06:01:17.150 --> 06:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
testimony um I have signed up to speak
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.440 --> 06:01:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
Todd

06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
Todd
 
06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Albert Todd live in
 
06:01:32.430 --> 06:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
nashille New
 
06:01:35.390 --> 06:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'll start out by stating
 
06:01:37.468 --> 06:01:37.478 align:start position:0%
this there be no greater a breakdown in
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
the trust and diplomacy between the
 
06:01:40.948 --> 06:01:40.958 align:start position:0%
people and their government than the
 
06:01:43.390 --> 06:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
violation of their vote and the right
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
thereof I have poured through our state
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
constitution multiple times every time I
 
06:01:50.350 --> 06:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
do so I notice the same principle the
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
power resides with the people now we
 
06:01:54.948 --> 06:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
have educated you on the issues and
 
06:01:56.990 --> 06:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
instructed you on on our will to fix
 
06:01:59.948 --> 06:01:59.958 align:start position:0%
these issu isues multiple times now each
 
06:02:02.270 --> 06:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
time we have been met with corruption
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
and intent on demonstrating power that
 
06:02:07.628 --> 06:02:07.638 align:start position:0%
no one in this state has given you if
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
the power resides with the people and
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
the people have enumerated and
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%
instructed their representatives through
 
06:02:15.750 --> 06:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
verbal and written correspondence then
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Constitution is quite clear as to
 
06:02:19.628 --> 06:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
what needs to happen next you are to
 
06:02:22.270 --> 06:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
enact legislation that is representative
 
06:02:24.750 --> 06:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
of their will anything less than this is
 
06:02:27.030 --> 06:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
quite clearly a breach of your oath to
 
06:02:29.230 --> 06:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and Mal administration
 
06:02:31.830 --> 06:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
of your office and you should be tried
 
06:02:35.070 --> 06:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
for treason and at minimum fired for it
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have been more than patient with you
 
06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
and worked hard to get legislation
 
06:02:40.708 --> 06:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
passed that is representative of our
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
will yet even now we have heard words
 
06:02:45.150 --> 06:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
from some of you that you will only
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill if this person or that
 
06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
person supports that bill I ask you did
 
06:02:52.788 --> 06:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
they elect you or did your District
 
06:02:55.548 --> 06:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
elect you is is it the will of the
 
06:02:57.670 --> 06:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
government that compels your decisions
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
or is it the will of your constituents
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
that compels your decisions if it is
 
06:03:02.868 --> 06:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
anything less than the latter then you
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
should remove yourself from these
 
06:03:05.948 --> 06:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
Chambers immediately and open your
 
06:03:07.708 --> 06:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
office up to someone who understands the
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
true role of government here in our
 
06:03:13.670 --> 06:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
Republic there isn't a single person
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
within this government that has not been
 
06:03:16.830 --> 06:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
educated regarding the issues on
 
06:03:18.910 --> 06:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
potential fraud that could be generated
 
06:03:21.548 --> 06:03:21.558 align:start position:0%
using these machines for crying out loud
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
Harry hursty your auditor your auditor
 
06:03:28.230 --> 06:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
made a documentary doc about it called
 
06:03:31.030 --> 06:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
hacking democracy to deny the potentials
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
of fraud using these machines would to
 
06:03:35.948 --> 06:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
deny the credentials of your own auditor
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
now I strongly implore you to do your
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
job and ban the use of these machines in
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
our Republic in order to secure a free
 
06:03:45.150 --> 06:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
Society for the
 
06:03:48.430 --> 06:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
posterity of our
 
06:03:51.868 --> 06:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
Republic thank thank you also signed up
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:56.200 --> 06:04:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
Todd

06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:04.830 --> 06:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a quick statement um
 
06:04:06.830 --> 06:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
Greenland used their machines to count
 
06:04:09.548 --> 06:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
the the special election for to get rid
 
06:04:12.910 --> 06:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
of their machines so there there's that
 
06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to start with a quote made
 
06:04:16.948 --> 06:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
at the audit by the chief investigator
 
06:04:19.310 --> 06:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the AG's office just because it's
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
unethical doesn't make it a criminal
 
06:04:24.230 --> 06:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
violation this quote summarizes the
 
06:04:26.468 --> 06:04:26.478 align:start position:0%
entire audit and the New Hampshire
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
government Harry
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
Hy Harry hsty resets the machine cards
 
06:04:33.390 --> 06:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
without making a copy and stated it was
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
the only way we later found out through
 
06:04:37.830 --> 06:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the machine manual that he could have
 
06:04:40.270 --> 06:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
made a copy of the memory card using the
 
06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
machine itself in doing this he violated
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
not only state law but also federal law
 
06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
after obtaining and reviewing the video
 
06:04:50.070 --> 06:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
Harry hsty resetting the the card
 
06:04:52.110 --> 06:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
something very particular caught my eye
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
Harry was using lhs's directions to
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
reset this
 
06:04:56.080 --> 06:04:57.868 align:start position:0%
reset this
card

06:04:57.868 --> 06:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
card
 
06:04:59.670 --> 06:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
could you imagine a business being
 
06:05:02.030 --> 06:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
audited by the IRS getting directions
 
06:05:03.910 --> 06:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the business they are auditing how
 
06:05:09.750 --> 06:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
them um when SP sp43 was originally
 
06:05:15.430 --> 06:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
introduced LHS wasn't even allowed at
 
06:05:15.440 --> 06:05:17.110 align:start position:0%
introduced LHS wasn't even allowed at
the

06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
audit unfortunately it was Barbara
 
06:05:22.430 --> 06:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
Griffin and this committee who onlined
 
06:05:25.628 --> 06:05:25.638 align:start position:0%
it and allowed LHS to be at an audit
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
which was a conflict of interest so are
 
06:05:29.548 --> 06:05:29.558 align:start position:0%
all three of our
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
Auditors when you take the four machines
 
06:05:34.390 --> 06:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
from Windom and you calculate the
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
overvotes and the undervotes Machine
 
06:05:40.990 --> 06:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
number two had a five about a 5% larger
 
06:05:43.750 --> 06:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase when Harry Hy reset the cards
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
and this is before he blew all the
 
06:05:48.468 --> 06:05:48.478 align:start position:0%
machine off and did his special tricks
 
06:05:51.230 --> 06:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
it went normal the overvotes and
 
06:05:52.750 --> 06:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
undervotes for the other four machines
 
06:05:54.590 --> 06:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
went normal and this was before he
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
cleaned the machine like he claims
 
06:06:02.150 --> 06:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
Harry hsty says in a in a an
 
06:06:06.270 --> 06:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit um signed under perjury for
 
06:06:09.510 --> 06:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
the Winsconsin court that these machines
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
can be manipulated and you would have to
 
06:06:14.030 --> 06:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
reset them and that clears the memory
 
06:06:15.910 --> 06:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
card I've sent you guys all that affid
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
David So when he reset that memory card
 
06:06:20.510 --> 06:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a coincidence that the
 
06:06:22.310 --> 06:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
overvotes and undervotes on machine
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
normal hacking democracy we've already
 
06:06:31.110 --> 06:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
gone over that foldgate someone else has
 
06:06:32.670 --> 06:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
already gone over that we're going to
 
06:06:34.750 --> 06:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
save the taxpayers in New Hampshire and
 
06:06:38.910 --> 06:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
astronomical amount of money I have over
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
$150,000 in in invoices for four states
 
06:06:45.468 --> 06:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
I mean for four towns in the state of
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's 136 towns that use
 
06:06:48.478 --> 06:06:50.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's 136 towns that use
these

06:06:50.190 --> 06:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:06:53.070 --> 06:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
machines this is not a partisan issue
 
06:06:54.510 --> 06:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's not I'm an
 
06:06:57.948 --> 06:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
independent I
 
06:07:00.510 --> 06:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's time for you guys to stand up
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
for us and stand up for America because
 
06:07:06.468 --> 06:07:06.478 align:start position:0%
this is our vote is the most sacred
 
06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
right that we have my three
 
06:07:11.670 --> 06:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
grandparents survived the trip from the
 
06:07:14.430 --> 06:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
Mayflower and survived that first winter
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
I have two
 
06:07:18.310 --> 06:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
grandfathers that fought in the American
 
06:07:21.590 --> 06:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
Revolution I am not going anywhere my
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
DNA is going to get these machines out
 
06:07:26.910 --> 06:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
of this town out out of the state whe
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
whether anybody likes it or not I won't
 
06:07:31.788 --> 06:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
give up it's not in my DNA now respect
 
06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room and get these
 
06:07:35.788 --> 06:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
machines out because you guys know for a
 
06:07:37.750 --> 06:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
fact that we should not be using these
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
machines thank you questions from
 
06:07:45.788 --> 06:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:49.590 --> 06:07:49.600 align:start position:0%

thank you for the
 
06:08:04.990 --> 06:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh Madam chairman I just
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to address uh one of the members
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee um the gentleman
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
Republican I yes I I'm sorry I don't we
 
06:08:15.910 --> 06:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't identify members by their party
 
06:08:17.390 --> 06:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
the representative has a name and your
 
06:08:18.590 --> 06:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
comment should be addressed to me
 
06:08:19.708 --> 06:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
through the committee that's just the
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
protocol well yes I was addressing it to
 
06:08:28.190 --> 06:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
you but it was in response to his H his
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
remarks um and I just wanted to
 
06:08:31.080 --> 06:08:32.788 align:start position:0%
remarks um and I just wanted to
say

06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:08:36.270 --> 06:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to address his
 
06:08:36.280 --> 06:08:38.150 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to address his
concern

06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
concern
 
06:08:41.788 --> 06:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
uh that he stated he would not want his
 
06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
former Democrat opponent to be counting
 
06:08:45.280 --> 06:08:46.150 align:start position:0%
former Democrat opponent to be counting
his

06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
his
 
06:08:49.230 --> 06:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
votes uh I just wanted to say that I've
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
been involved in
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
recounts and in hand counting years ago
 
06:08:57.510 --> 06:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
in my town of miramac and it's
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
never hand counting is never done in a
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
vacuum by one
 
06:09:08.030 --> 06:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
party they have uh safeguards for that
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it's always Democrat Republican and
 
06:09:14.750 --> 06:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
if there's another party involved there
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
there's there's always safeguards so his
 
06:09:20.990 --> 06:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
concern is something that he does not
 
06:09:23.468 --> 06:09:23.478 align:start position:0%
need to be concerned about and I just
 
06:09:25.628 --> 06:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that point Thank you
 
06:09:29.390 --> 06:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
Al also signed up to speak on this is Mr
 
06:09:36.670 --> 06:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
Grace is it
 
06:09:42.310 --> 06:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
natch is natch gra still here apparently
 
06:09:48.150 --> 06:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:52.150 --> 06:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
bergus good afternoon um Johnny bures
 
06:09:57.390 --> 06:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire properties in
 
06:09:58.868 --> 06:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
multiple towns in New Hampshire several
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
businesses a little dressed down but I
 
06:10:03.430 --> 06:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
own a significant insurance agency and I
 
06:10:05.270 --> 06:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
can put my agents in front of a Walmart
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
for the day and I know they'll get about
 
06:10:09.910 --> 06:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
16 sales and a really good day maybe 22
 
06:10:12.548 --> 06:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
a really bad day maybe 11 but if once in
 
06:10:15.070 --> 06:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
a while they get 64 something happened
 
06:10:16.990 --> 06:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
you can't expl it's called an anomaly
 
06:10:19.150 --> 06:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
when Harry Hy said there was an anomaly
 
06:10:21.230 --> 06:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
I think moisture or some ridiculous one
 
06:10:23.110 --> 06:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
in a million in
 
06:10:25.868 --> 06:10:25.878 align:start position:0%
Windham there's also one in a million in
 
06:10:28.868 --> 06:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
Bedford in Amherst in Claremont all over
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
this state that doesn't just happen if I
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
send an ad out for my real estate
 
06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
business or my insurance business I'll
 
06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
get about a one quarter of 1% response
 
06:10:38.708 --> 06:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
if I have a really colorful ad I might
 
06:10:40.830 --> 06:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
get a half a percent if I do really good
 
06:10:42.430 --> 06:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
a tiny bit better than that if I ever
 
06:10:44.788 --> 06:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
get a 9% response something happened you
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
can't explain these away listen they
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
make chocolate and vanilla because we're
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
not all the same if we all believe we
 
06:10:53.830 --> 06:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
had Integrity in voting we could if my
 
06:10:57.270 --> 06:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
if my opponent one of one of vote I
 
06:10:58.788 --> 06:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
would tip my hat and say see you in four
 
06:11:01.150 --> 06:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
years I'd buy you a beer or a coffee and
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
try to talk you into what I think ex Etc
 
06:11:06.390 --> 06:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
but if we had voting Integrity we'd all
 
06:11:08.230 --> 06:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
get along great right now we know we
 
06:11:10.510 --> 06:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
don't because of the machines it's not a
 
06:11:12.788 --> 06:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
I mean the heroic work of Maryland and
 
06:11:15.548 --> 06:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voter Integrity 19 192% of
 
06:11:17.150 --> 06:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
people voted in water in Waterville
 
06:11:19.070 --> 06:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
Valley I mean there's something very
 
06:11:20.910 --> 06:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
very wrong with this great state we can
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
fix it but that's up to you
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
guys thank
 
06:11:25.558 --> 06:11:27.310 align:start position:0%
guys thank

06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
Goss I apologize for the inability to
 
06:11:46.510 --> 06:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
read your
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
handwriting it's not the it's not the
 
06:11:51.230 --> 06:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
first time and the name is harleen
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
harleen yeah the why is silent they did
 
06:11:55.468 --> 06:11:55.478 align:start position:0%
that to confuse
 
06:11:55.478 --> 06:11:57.510 align:start position:0%
that to confuse
everybody

06:11:57.510 --> 06:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
06:11:59.510 --> 06:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
I did not plan to speak today but I
 
06:12:02.150 --> 06:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
learned something that really upset me
 
06:12:05.590 --> 06:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
immensely I do Hospital lab work we have
 
06:12:09.030 --> 06:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
protocols for every machine that we run
 
06:12:11.910 --> 06:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
if we run a lab test and it is 10% off
 
06:12:14.670 --> 06:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
if it's even 5% off you can send a
 
06:12:17.590 --> 06:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
patient from being a normal value to a
 
06:12:21.070 --> 06:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
bad diagnosis to even a critical value
 
06:12:22.990 --> 06:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
and when I learned that there is no
 
06:12:25.548 --> 06:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
quality control on these machines
 
06:12:27.708 --> 06:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
there's no preven maintenance on these
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
machines that to me is absolutely
 
06:12:33.190 --> 06:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
horrifying I can tell you that we have
 
06:12:34.868 --> 06:12:34.878 align:start position:0%
PMS done on our
 
06:12:39.230 --> 06:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
machines regularly it's documented
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
anybody can check it out we have any
 
06:12:45.750 --> 06:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
kind of issue we get the company in but
 
06:12:49.030 --> 06:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
every day that we run a test on those
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
machines we are doing quality control
 
06:12:55.230 --> 06:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it's three times a day
 
06:12:56.830 --> 06:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
depending upon the particular particular
 
06:12:59.468 --> 06:12:59.478 align:start position:0%
test and the particular instrument so
 
06:13:02.150 --> 06:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that these machines only have
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
one company responsible for them and
 
06:13:06.430 --> 06:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
there's no quality
 
06:13:08.948 --> 06:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
control that to me is
 
06:13:11.468 --> 06:13:11.478 align:start position:0%
horrifying because we could kill
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
somebody with the wrong lab result just
 
06:13:16.070 --> 06:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
think about that this is not life or
 
06:13:18.110 --> 06:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
death but this is the death of Freedom
 
06:13:19.948 --> 06:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
if we don't do something about that
 
06:13:23.868 --> 06:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:46.270 --> 06:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Jen Mercer from
 
06:13:49.548 --> 06:13:49.558 align:start position:0%
Lowden I'm asking you to support hp6
 
06:13:52.230 --> 06:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
1064 to to require paper ballots and
 
06:13:54.990 --> 06:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
hand counting for the entire State I
 
06:13:57.230 --> 06:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
along with the 80
 
06:14:00.190 --> 06:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
to 100 million voters would like my vote
 
06:14:03.150 --> 06:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
to count yes Trump won in a historical
 
06:14:05.350 --> 06:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
Landslide I'm not going to repeat the
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
information already presented Mark Mark
 
06:14:10.030 --> 06:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
and the rest of those speaking in
 
06:14:12.430 --> 06:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
support did a great job I've done my
 
06:14:14.430 --> 06:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
research on the ability to use
 
06:14:16.750 --> 06:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
algorithms and adjudications to alter
 
06:14:19.150 --> 06:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
votes with these machines I've watched
 
06:14:21.510 --> 06:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
election night as votes mysteriously
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
switched as counting was shut down for
 
06:14:26.270 --> 06:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
numerous numerous ridiculous reasons
 
06:14:28.430 --> 06:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
reasons when Trump was ahead only to
 
06:14:30.750 --> 06:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
wake up to a changing to abide and lead
 
06:14:32.590 --> 06:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
or changing in the several days and
 
06:14:34.868 --> 06:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
weeks that followed as fake ballots were
 
06:14:37.548 --> 06:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
B in or our counters were processing
 
06:14:39.468 --> 06:14:39.478 align:start position:0%
ballots that was followed up with
 
06:14:40.948 --> 06:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours of going through the
 
06:14:43.708 --> 06:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
information and the NOA report the Maric
 
06:14:46.030 --> 06:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
Copa County forensic election audit and
 
06:14:48.350 --> 06:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
the audit report from New Hampshire if
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have time to do your research
 
06:14:52.750 --> 06:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
then you should at least ask yourself
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
how does a state flip to Red at the
 
06:14:58.030 --> 06:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
state level but vote blue at the
 
06:15:00.948 --> 06:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
national level this makes zero sense
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
unless cheating was involved reminder
 
06:15:07.150 --> 06:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
the evidence shows that Trump won we are
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
in this economic and social mess because
 
06:15:11.708 --> 06:15:11.718 align:start position:0%
of the cheating that happened it's long
 
06:15:14.150 --> 06:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
past time that you take action one to
 
06:15:16.270 --> 06:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
fix 2020 before we lose everything to
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
communist China in the meantime please
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
vote to support hb10 64 to remove the
 
06:15:25.510 --> 06:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
machines thank you thank you for your
 
06:15:29.110 --> 06:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
Kelly um thank you Madame chair um I
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
would like to say that um I was at the
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
wiam audit for 15 days and what I saw is
 
06:15:56.830 --> 06:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's a mat
 
06:15:59.350 --> 06:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
show the switch and
 
06:16:01.830 --> 06:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
swapping I've tried to pay attention to
 
06:16:03.510 --> 06:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
machine number two because that's the
 
06:16:07.070 --> 06:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
questionable one and you know what most
 
06:16:08.708 --> 06:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
of us couldn't tell which one is number
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
two and at the the 15th day it's not the
 
06:16:15.150 --> 06:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
machine that that's supposed to be
 
06:16:18.190 --> 06:16:18.200 align:start position:0%
number two they switch everything and
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
the ballot running from Zig over here
 
06:16:23.868 --> 06:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
run over there over here and over there
 
06:16:26.510 --> 06:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
zigzag like that they don't run the test
 
06:16:29.750 --> 06:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
like this so you can follow one pie of B
 
06:16:34.230 --> 06:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
Ballance no it's like so confusing it's
 
06:16:37.910 --> 06:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
like a circus in there and Harry Hy say
 
06:16:41.628 --> 06:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
oh this is a per um a perfect storm no
 
06:16:44.510 --> 06:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's a mess it's not a perfect
 
06:16:48.150 --> 06:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
storm and I was at the marry Max special
 
06:16:53.150 --> 06:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
election um billboard one right and they
 
06:16:55.670 --> 06:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
have a ballot that's prefilled with the
 
06:16:59.230 --> 06:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
democ on it and I happen to interview
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
the guy that got that ballot you know
 
06:17:05.628 --> 06:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
and these all counted by the machine and
 
06:17:08.910 --> 06:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
and Dair just recently in da special
 
06:17:12.510 --> 06:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
election about 2:00 The Machine's down
 
06:17:14.750 --> 06:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
so they had they sto using that machine
 
06:17:18.628 --> 06:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
so machine do act up and have problems
 
06:17:21.270 --> 06:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a system in place to
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
maintain or to you know monitor them so
 
06:17:26.910 --> 06:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
the best thing is to get get rid of the
 
06:17:30.030 --> 06:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
machine we know how to count them by
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
hands and that's the best thing we can
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
do because most of us don't have trust
 
06:17:38.670 --> 06:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
in it anymore and I just want to credit
 
06:17:43.270 --> 06:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
all this to Mr Tom marray and Ken iring
 
06:17:46.190 --> 06:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
these are the two most dedicated New
 
06:17:48.708 --> 06:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens that worked on this
 
06:17:51.868 --> 06:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
for months to bring our attention to the
 
06:17:55.150 --> 06:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
wiam audit and that's why it causes
 
06:17:55.160 --> 06:17:56.430 align:start position:0%
wiam audit and that's why it causes
movement

06:17:56.430 --> 06:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
movement
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
around the country not just New
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so New Hampshire is a primary
 
06:18:04.708 --> 06:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
State Live Free or Die we set the sample
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
so let's do it right get rid of all of
 
06:18:11.150 --> 06:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
the machine restore the faith and the
 
06:18:14.590 --> 06:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
trust of the people to preserve our
 
06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
freedom it doesn't matter how much it
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
cost or how long it take we have to if
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
we have this many people in the room we
 
06:18:24.150 --> 06:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
should have that many bathroom prepared
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
for them right if we have a big big city
 
06:18:28.270 --> 06:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
we need to have the system in place to
 
06:18:30.310 --> 06:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
count all the ballots so it finished by
 
06:18:34.110 --> 06:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
12:00 the end don't get lazy and get use
 
06:18:36.468 --> 06:18:36.478 align:start position:0%
of the machine so we have all this mess
 
06:18:39.150 --> 06:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
and it cost us so much money but what's
 
06:18:43.110 --> 06:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
most importantly is C our civil rights
 
06:18:46.670 --> 06:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
our Liberty and I flee Vietnam as a
 
06:18:49.788 --> 06:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
political refugees so I know the value
 
06:18:52.430 --> 06:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
of freedom and democracy and my father
 
06:18:54.868 --> 06:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
spent seven years in the Vietnamese
 
06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
communist prison
 
06:19:00.310 --> 06:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
as a political prisoner as PW we know
 
06:19:02.948 --> 06:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
and we don't want it here and with us
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
being lazy by not counting by hand we
 
06:19:07.948 --> 06:19:07.958 align:start position:0%
lose everything do you all want to be in
 
06:19:12.468 --> 06:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
prison for seven years no right Miss
 
06:19:14.030 --> 06:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Kelly if I have to raise my voice
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
we probably ought to bring it down I'm
 
06:19:18.270 --> 06:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
sorry and if you could wrap it up it'ses
 
06:19:20.510 --> 06:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I'm sorry I get excited you
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm I'm so passionate because I
 
06:19:25.948 --> 06:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
love my freedom I can breathe freedom
 
06:19:27.990 --> 06:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
the first day I was in this country I
 
06:19:30.150 --> 06:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
love New Hampshire this is the first and
 
06:19:32.948 --> 06:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
the only state that I live here I love
 
06:19:34.990 --> 06:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I love to keep it that
 
06:19:39.708 --> 06:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
way so please vote to support 1064 thank
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
you appreciate it thank you all
 
06:19:46.190 --> 06:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
right next to to sign up thank you for
 
06:19:46.200 --> 06:19:47.030 align:start position:0%
right next to to sign up thank you for
the

06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
the

to eight we had to turn them away we
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
didn't have a place to put them all if
 
06:20:42.948 --> 06:20:42.958 align:start position:0%

and they are looking and they want to
 
06:20:49.390 --> 06:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
see because they don't trust their
 
06:20:52.190 --> 06:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
elections and as my predecessor so amply
 
06:20:55.468 --> 06:20:55.478 align:start position:0%

this we don't get rid of these machines
 
06:20:59.868 --> 06:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
we are not going to ever get another
 
06:20:59.878 --> 06:21:02.430 align:start position:0%
we are not going to ever get another
free

K exer I didn't do it in my town and
 
06:22:03.430 --> 06:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
watched what happened and I really
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
started to get involved because I'm like
 
06:22:07.948 --> 06:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
you know there's something here that I

understand and the more I did my
 
06:22:15.788 --> 06:22:15.798 align:start position:0%
homework uh the more concerned I got and
 
06:22:18.270 --> 06:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm about to tell you these facts
 
06:22:20.110 --> 06:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
the selectman in the town of kensing
 
06:22:22.510 --> 06:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
Kensington to their credit put it on the
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
website I did a
 
06:22:28.510 --> 06:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
citizens uh report I went in and
 
06:22:32.670 --> 06:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
audited uh the Town Clerk and the town
 
06:22:34.948 --> 06:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
moderator and specifically for the
 
06:22:38.030 --> 06:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
machines the machines have three
 
06:22:42.230 --> 06:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
activity logs Canvas Bag data card
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
microchip on those data logs are witness
 
06:22:47.868 --> 06:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
signings when a witness Witnesses when
 
06:22:49.708 --> 06:22:49.718 align:start position:0%
they use the you know when the cards
 
06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
come in and out the Micro Data comes in
 
06:22:52.830 --> 06:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
and out all that when there's
 
06:22:55.750 --> 06:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the machine about 40% %
 
06:22:58.390 --> 06:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the time they didn't have a second
 
06:23:02.070 --> 06:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
witness 40% of the time the maintenance
 
06:23:05.070 --> 06:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
person who did the work on the machine
 
06:23:08.910 --> 06:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
you can't read their name by contract in
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
the town of Kensington and I'm assuming
 
06:23:13.070 --> 06:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
that all of them are like this the LHS
 
06:23:15.590 --> 06:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
contract says that it can be their
 
06:23:19.070 --> 06:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative or somebody they
 
06:23:21.110 --> 06:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
designate when maintenance is done on
 
06:23:22.868 --> 06:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
the machine they're supposed to say what
 
06:23:24.230 --> 06:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
they did not
 
06:23:26.910 --> 06:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance most most of almost 90% of
 
06:23:28.948 --> 06:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
the documents assigned
 
06:23:31.150 --> 06:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance I'm saying this is my little
 
06:23:33.708 --> 06:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
town in Kensington to the gentleman that
 
06:23:35.830 --> 06:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
talked about Greenland it's not an
 
06:23:38.150 --> 06:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
emotional thing the town clerk work with
 
06:23:40.510 --> 06:23:40.520 align:start position:0%

town attorney worked with us this is a
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
positive experience it was a it was hard
 
06:23:47.468 --> 06:23:47.478 align:start position:0%
no one wanted to go through it but we
 
06:23:49.468 --> 06:23:49.478 align:start position:0%
did and we did it right and we came
 
06:23:52.230 --> 06:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
together on it and you can do it too but
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
you need to look at those activity
 
06:23:56.590 --> 06:23:56.600 align:start position:0%

tentarelli thank you thank you for this
 
06:24:58.270 --> 06:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Liz
 
06:25:01.350 --> 06:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
tanelli I'm from Newbury and I
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge the committee to vote
 
06:25:07.310 --> 06:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate on this bill
 
06:25:10.110 --> 06:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh I had to change my testimony as I
 
06:25:12.868 --> 06:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
explained on the earlier Bill across the
 
06:25:16.070 --> 06:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
road uh so I I did a little cross out on
 
06:25:22.030 --> 06:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:25.590 --> 06:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
1064 I have included in my testimony
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
copies of the articles that the sponsor
 
06:25:31.948 --> 06:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
of the bill referred to David Brooks he
 
06:25:34.910 --> 06:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
calls himself the granet geek of the
 
06:25:38.670 --> 06:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor did a study of our
 
06:25:41.830 --> 06:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
handc counted elections that is our
 
06:25:45.990 --> 06:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
recounts compare them with the machine
 
06:25:50.468 --> 06:25:50.478 align:start position:0%
counts in those elections from 2016 2018
 
06:25:50.478 --> 06:25:51.628 align:start position:0%
counts in those elections from 2016 2018
and

06:25:51.628 --> 06:25:51.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:54.750 --> 06:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
2020 and found that the machines had an
 
06:25:54.760 --> 06:25:55.708 align:start position:0%
2020 and found that the machines had an
accurate

06:25:55.708 --> 06:25:55.718 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
06:25:59.670 --> 06:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.670 --> 06:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
99.7% pretty good when we think about
 
06:26:05.350 --> 06:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
our cities and the huge number of
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
ballots that need to be
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
counted I'd like you to think about how
 
06:26:14.590 --> 06:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
hard it will be to find people to do
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that counting in those
 
06:26:20.548 --> 06:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
cities in 2020 in my role with the
 
06:26:23.868 --> 06:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan League of Women Voters I was
 
06:26:26.350 --> 06:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
trying to find bance ballot clerks
 
06:26:29.868 --> 06:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
around the state to replace some of the
 
06:26:32.190 --> 06:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
elderly ballot clerks who'd been doing
 
06:26:35.510 --> 06:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
it for years but because of covid were
 
06:26:38.590 --> 06:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
concerned for for their health and had
 
06:26:42.230 --> 06:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
to step down that was not an easy job
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
imagine now trying to find all those
 
06:26:46.670 --> 06:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
additional ballot
 
06:26:50.350 --> 06:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
counters human beings make
 
06:26:53.150 --> 06:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
mistakes it requires very close
 
06:26:56.190 --> 06:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
attention to do that kind of B counting
 
06:26:58.750 --> 06:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
multiple candidates multiple
 
06:27:02.110 --> 06:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
races to do it for hour upon hour it
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
can't be the same people who are the
 
06:27:06.150 --> 06:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
ballot clerks all day
 
06:27:08.830 --> 06:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
obviously so I ask you to think about
 
06:27:12.750 --> 06:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
the logistics of this but also about the
 
06:27:16.230 --> 06:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
proven accuracy in the analysis that
 
06:27:19.910 --> 06:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
David Brooks did of our hand counts
 
06:27:23.190 --> 06:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
versus the machine counts and so I have
 
06:27:25.910 --> 06:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
attached those articles to to this
 
06:27:28.468 --> 06:27:28.478 align:start position:0%
testimony and I urge you to vote in
 
06:27:32.270 --> 06:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank
 
06:27:35.190 --> 06:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you also signed up to speak on
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%

much okay thank you so my name is Louise

Spencer I live in conquered and I am the
 
06:28:16.070 --> 06:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
co-founder of at all Grassroots
 
06:28:18.628 --> 06:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
organization called the Kent Street
 
06:28:21.910 --> 06:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition um I am speaking though today
 
06:28:26.070 --> 06:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
on my own behalf um I'd like to to
 
06:28:28.150 --> 06:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
congratulate all the people who showed
 
06:28:32.510 --> 06:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
up today to participate in our democracy
 
06:28:34.468 --> 06:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
that's always a good thing when we have
 
06:28:37.830 --> 06:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
people who come and share their
 
06:28:42.190 --> 06:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
opinions um and I I truly am grateful
 
06:28:47.310 --> 06:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
that we have engaged um members of the
 
06:28:49.948 --> 06:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
public I would like to point out however
 
06:28:52.830 --> 06:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
since several members mentioned how many
 
06:28:55.868 --> 06:28:55.878 align:start position:0%
people are here today that that I'm
 
06:28:57.350 --> 06:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
aware of many who did not feel
 
06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable coming uh because of the
 
06:29:04.708 --> 06:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
thinking that it would be in the small
 
06:29:06.310 --> 06:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
room over in the
 
06:29:10.270 --> 06:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
lob and that therefore their presence is
 
06:29:13.190 --> 06:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
not represented here today and I would
 
06:29:16.070 --> 06:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
just like the committee to
 
06:29:18.230 --> 06:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are limits on
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
people's ability right now to show up in
 
06:29:26.270 --> 06:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
person um the other thing that I would
 
06:29:31.190 --> 06:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
like to mention is that I think
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
our much of the distrust of our
 
06:29:37.590 --> 06:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
elections um has been the result of a
 
06:29:40.070 --> 06:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
failure of
 
06:29:44.070 --> 06:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
leadership that myths and about voter
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
fraud about misfunctioning
 
06:29:52.628 --> 06:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
machines about um absentee
 
06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
bullets um these are
 
06:29:57.590 --> 06:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
there are facts on these things and they
 
06:30:00.030 --> 06:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
these issues should be corrected by
 
06:30:02.590 --> 06:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
those who are in position to know better
 
06:30:04.350 --> 06:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
we have one of the most successful
 
06:30:08.070 --> 06:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
elections in our country's history this
 
06:30:13.070 --> 06:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
last round with more people excuse
 
06:30:15.750 --> 06:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
me that's why I ask that people don't I
 
06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
not say a word people who agree or
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
disagree with everything that gets said
 
06:30:21.868 --> 06:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
in any hearing and if you've been on
 
06:30:25.150 --> 06:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
this side of the table you know that so
 
06:30:25.160 --> 06:30:27.390 align:start position:0%
this side of the table you know that so
so

06:30:27.390 --> 06:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:30:31.310 --> 06:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
um charges about the elections were
 
06:30:36.430 --> 06:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
brought before many many many courts and
 
06:30:39.948 --> 06:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
dismissed so I would like to I'm here
 
06:30:43.388 --> 06:30:43.398 align:start position:0%
today asking our leaders our elected
 
06:30:47.110 --> 06:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
leaders to do a better job in
 
06:30:49.910 --> 06:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
confronting some of the mistruths out
 
06:30:52.868 --> 06:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
there that
 
06:30:55.830 --> 06:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
inform the the dist Trust of our
 
06:30:58.270 --> 06:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
elections we're told our elections
 
06:31:00.548 --> 06:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
aren't safe and therefore people believe
 
06:31:05.070 --> 06:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
that we have elections that we can be
 
06:31:08.310 --> 06:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
extremely proud of we have election
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:15.948 --> 06:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
hard they're often under it's been a
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
little over three minutes so if you
 
06:31:19.468 --> 06:31:19.478 align:start position:0%
could wrap up I'm happy to wrap up I one
 
06:31:22.430 --> 06:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to point out I'm glad to
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
see that people are being able to
 
06:31:26.910 --> 06:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
Express their opinion today by raising
 
06:31:30.350 --> 06:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
their hands but I uh I've been
 
06:31:33.230 --> 06:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
reprimanded for doing that in past
 
06:31:35.708 --> 06:31:35.718 align:start position:0%
hearings so I'm a little bit surprised
 
06:31:39.548 --> 06:31:39.558 align:start position:0%
to see that but thank you very much as
 
06:31:41.388 --> 06:31:41.398 align:start position:0%
as chair of the committee I exercise a
 
06:31:42.750 --> 06:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
certain amount of discretion on the
 
06:31:45.948 --> 06:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
conduct but reps Hall's rules I try to
 
06:31:51.230 --> 06:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:53.468 --> 06:31:53.478 align:start position:0%
so those of you who come to committee
 
06:31:55.350 --> 06:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
meetings know that all Comm meetings are
 
06:31:56.990 --> 06:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
run a little differently depending on
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
who's at the front of the room so there
 
06:32:02.270 --> 06:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
you go um also signed up to speak on
 
06:32:04.910 --> 06:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
this is uh secretary scanland David
 
06:32:08.110 --> 06:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
scanland I have a pink card for Mr Grace
 
06:32:11.190 --> 06:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
who has apparently left if anybody else
 
06:32:14.388 --> 06:32:14.398 align:start position:0%
is here and wants to speak if they could
 
06:32:16.948 --> 06:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
head up back and grab a pink card or or
 
06:32:19.590 --> 06:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
get ready to speak because uh secretary
 
06:32:21.910 --> 06:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
scan and I have as the last speaker on
 
06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
this bill we do of course have well then
 
06:32:53.548 --> 06:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:53.558 --> 06:33:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
outside

06:33:10.910 --> 06:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:13.830 --> 06:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
I want to give you the time to speak so
 
06:33:17.310 --> 06:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific I don't know Shia
 
06:33:18.948 --> 06:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
Kelly there are there still ping cards
 
06:33:22.190 --> 06:33:22.200 align:start position:0%

06:33:24.830 --> 06:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right secretary scanland thank
 
06:33:26.990 --> 06:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair members of the
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee um David scanland acting
 
06:33:31.948 --> 06:33:31.958 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State not taking a position
 
06:33:34.750 --> 06:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill today uh because it has
 
06:33:35.990 --> 06:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
always been the position of the
 
06:33:38.350 --> 06:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that in the
 
06:33:40.910 --> 06:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
first instance it's the municipalities
 
06:33:42.468 --> 06:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
that make the decision on whether or not
 
06:33:44.468 --> 06:33:44.478 align:start position:0%
they're going to use a ballot counting
 
06:33:47.310 --> 06:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
device or not and ultimately it's the
 
06:33:50.270 --> 06:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's the legislator's uh responsibility
 
06:33:53.708 --> 06:33:53.718 align:start position:0%
to determine whether uh they can be used
 
06:33:56.310 --> 06:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the state as as a
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
whole I wanted to comment on this bill
 
06:34:02.670 --> 06:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
because it is uh indirectly addressing a
 
06:34:05.708 --> 06:34:05.718 align:start position:0%
much larger issue uh an issue that was
 
06:34:07.708 --> 06:34:07.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times today and that
 
06:34:10.910 --> 06:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
is the declining lack of confidence uh
 
06:34:11.750 --> 06:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
in our
 
06:34:13.990 --> 06:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
elections and I agree with many of the
 
06:34:16.270 --> 06:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
comments that were made that you know we
 
06:34:19.270 --> 06:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to get a handle on that and we have
 
06:34:21.628 --> 06:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
to turn it around and we have to make it
 
06:34:24.468 --> 06:34:24.478 align:start position:0%
this A positive experience uh and I
 
06:34:26.230 --> 06:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
certainly think that we can do
 
06:34:29.190 --> 06:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
that our experience has been that when
 
06:34:32.310 --> 06:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
the voter properly marks a ballot the
 
06:34:34.708 --> 06:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
uote machine does a pretty good job
 
06:34:37.150 --> 06:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
counting it there are instances where a
 
06:34:39.430 --> 06:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
voter won't put their Mark in an oval
 
06:34:41.510 --> 06:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
and in that instance the machine's not
 
06:34:43.948 --> 06:34:43.958 align:start position:0%
going to count that vote on the ballot
 
06:34:45.750 --> 06:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
and that results in what could be
 
06:34:48.788 --> 06:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
considered an error if you did away with
 
06:34:50.510 --> 06:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
the machines if we got rid of them
 
06:34:52.590 --> 06:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
completely I don't believe that the
 
06:34:54.990 --> 06:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
problem is going to be solved
 
06:34:56.990 --> 06:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
because there are many many instances
 
06:34:59.150 --> 06:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
where there are hand counts that have
 
06:35:01.548 --> 06:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
been done in elections that have been
 
06:35:04.270 --> 06:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
off to a much greater degree than
 
06:35:07.388 --> 06:35:07.398 align:start position:0%
machine counts as long as there are
 
06:35:10.110 --> 06:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
humans involved in the election process
 
06:35:12.910 --> 06:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have errors and when we
 
06:35:14.708 --> 06:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
do a state election there could easily
 
06:35:17.750 --> 06:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
be as many as 6,000 people working at
 
06:35:20.830 --> 06:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
the polling places making sure that that
 
06:35:23.310 --> 06:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
uh election is conducted and that those
 
06:35:25.868 --> 06:35:25.878 align:start position:0%
votes are counted
 
06:35:27.430 --> 06:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking in my own mind how
 
06:35:29.628 --> 06:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
can we start taking steps to restore
 
06:35:33.070 --> 06:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
confidence uh in our elections where we
 
06:35:34.910 --> 06:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
can get back to where we've been you
 
06:35:36.750 --> 06:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
know 10 years ago and I will add that
 
06:35:38.750 --> 06:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
really our our voting system hasn't
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
changed in at least 25 or 30 years uh
 
06:35:45.230 --> 06:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
but all of a sudden today uh there's a
 
06:35:47.750 --> 06:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
great deal of scrutiny and concern about
 
06:35:49.070 --> 06:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh what's actually
 
06:35:51.670 --> 06:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
happening um some of it's based on
 
06:35:53.868 --> 06:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
misinformation but some of the concerns
 
06:35:57.868 --> 06:35:57.878 align:start position:0%
are real and and I uh I understand
 
06:36:00.190 --> 06:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
that I guess one of the things that I
 
06:36:01.590 --> 06:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest that there are
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
many ways that we can address this issue
 
06:36:06.110 --> 06:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
one are Audits and I know that your
 
06:36:09.030 --> 06:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh has a number of audit bills
 
06:36:11.708 --> 06:36:11.718 align:start position:0%
coming up to take a look at um I think
 
06:36:14.030 --> 06:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
the the the process has to be as
 
06:36:17.150 --> 06:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
transparent as it can be so that any one
 
06:36:19.788 --> 06:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
of you can understand the process which
 
06:36:23.070 --> 06:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
actually begins in June and it it goes
 
06:36:25.830 --> 06:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
through uh to a couple of weeks after
 
06:36:27.190 --> 06:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
the election's over while we're
 
06:36:27.200 --> 06:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
the election's over while we're
conducting

06:36:28.150 --> 06:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
conducting
 
06:36:30.590 --> 06:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
recounts and that's going to be a goal
 
06:36:32.350 --> 06:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
of mine you know I'm happy to talk to
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
you about ideas that uh will make that
 
06:36:37.388 --> 06:36:37.398 align:start position:0%
successful I know I have had
 
06:36:40.030 --> 06:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with Ken iring in the past
 
06:36:42.070 --> 06:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and I've certainly appreciated his
 
06:36:44.670 --> 06:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
comments and and I think he understands
 
06:36:46.150 --> 06:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh what we go through in conducting an
 
06:36:50.110 --> 06:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
election as well so um as a gentleman
 
06:36:51.830 --> 06:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
said I think that we can we can turn
 
06:36:55.150 --> 06:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
this into a positive thing and uh and
 
06:36:57.270 --> 06:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd be happy to answer any
 
06:36:59.708 --> 06:36:59.718 align:start position:0%
questions all right does anybody on the
 
06:37:01.510 --> 06:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
committee have any questions for this
 
06:37:03.910 --> 06:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
secretary Madam chair if I could I I did
 
06:37:06.510 --> 06:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
have a an item just specific to the to
 
06:37:09.150 --> 06:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
the bill itself okay and that is that it
 
06:37:12.430 --> 06:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
talks about using durable paper ballots
 
06:37:14.990 --> 06:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
and if that language is going to be used
 
06:37:18.430 --> 06:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
in uh a version of this bill I think the
 
06:37:20.430 --> 06:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
word durable should be defined I me
 
06:37:22.270 --> 06:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
right now we're required to keep
 
06:37:25.110 --> 06:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
ballots by Statute for a period of 22
 
06:37:27.788 --> 06:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
months after an election uh and then
 
06:37:29.788 --> 06:37:29.798 align:start position:0%
they can be destroyed but if there's an
 
06:37:32.548 --> 06:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
intent to keep them longer than that uh
 
06:37:34.990 --> 06:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
I think that word or that term should be
 
06:37:41.468 --> 06:37:41.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:44.708 --> 06:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
statute representative Barry um thank
 
06:37:46.350 --> 06:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
you and Mr SEC congratulations on your
 
06:37:48.510 --> 06:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
position um in your testimony did I hear
 
06:37:50.270 --> 06:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
correctly that your office would support
 
06:37:52.670 --> 06:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
the concept of
 
06:37:54.868 --> 06:37:54.878 align:start position:0%
audits I I
 
06:37:59.310 --> 06:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
our our office has uh supported a a
 
06:38:01.468 --> 06:38:01.478 align:start position:0%
version of audits in the past you know
 
06:38:04.590 --> 06:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
it all depends on how it takes
 
06:38:06.910 --> 06:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
place thank you any further questions
 
06:38:09.548 --> 06:38:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:13.430 --> 06:38:13.440 align:start position:0%

06:38:16.150 --> 06:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative prome O'Brien thank you
 
06:38:18.948 --> 06:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you congratulations on your
 
06:38:22.590 --> 06:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
position um I have been on both sides of
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
this issue myself when I saw some
 
06:38:26.350 --> 06:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
irregularities in the election in my
 
06:38:28.350 --> 06:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
community uh one thing that was very
 
06:38:31.110 --> 06:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
helpful was this book of election laws
 
06:38:35.388 --> 06:38:35.398 align:start position:0%
it goes over the machines and process
 
06:38:37.388 --> 06:38:37.398 align:start position:0%
and isn't it true that this is available
 
06:38:38.750 --> 06:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
for free in your office around the
 
06:38:41.468 --> 06:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
corner for anyone that wants it uh
 
06:38:44.030 --> 06:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's true represent Brian anybody can
 
06:38:46.548 --> 06:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
stop in and pick up an election law book
 
06:38:51.110 --> 06:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:10.310 --> 06:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:12.270 --> 06:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
hi teres Lawrence Manchester New
 
06:39:14.708 --> 06:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have any statistics or
 
06:39:17.510 --> 06:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
anything to bring here I actually really
 
06:39:20.110 --> 06:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
avoided this realm up until you know
 
06:39:23.388 --> 06:39:23.398 align:start position:0%
like two years ago like many people um
 
06:39:25.590 --> 06:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
but I have this this to offer I watched
 
06:39:27.948 --> 06:39:27.958 align:start position:0%
the election in
 
06:39:30.910 --> 06:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
November and I watched a live stream of
 
06:39:33.990 --> 06:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
the front of the building on some random
 
06:39:37.230 --> 06:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
person's Channel and on my TV and then I
 
06:39:39.468 --> 06:39:39.478 align:start position:0%
went through my phone and I looked at
 
06:39:42.150 --> 06:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
mainstream media channels doing a live
 
06:39:44.910 --> 06:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
stream stream of what was going on there
 
06:39:48.590 --> 06:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't a match I've watched people get
 
06:39:52.510 --> 06:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
torn apart I see a president that looks
 
06:39:54.388 --> 06:39:54.398 align:start position:0%
like he's doing Tik Tok videos on a
 
06:39:59.670 --> 06:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
green screen and while I didn't vote I
 
06:40:01.948 --> 06:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
think the problem is that nobody trusts
 
06:40:05.468 --> 06:40:05.478 align:start position:0%
the machines and I'm for it I think that
 
06:40:08.150 --> 06:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's silly to just discredit humans as
 
06:40:10.628 --> 06:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
these flawed things that can't get along
 
06:40:13.350 --> 06:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
and come to terms with each other and do
 
06:40:15.230 --> 06:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
things the right way I think it's
 
06:40:17.628 --> 06:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
dangerous to keep putting everything
 
06:40:19.708 --> 06:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
onto technology I mean I have a laptop
 
06:40:21.948 --> 06:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
that I want to turn into a frisbee
 
06:40:24.708 --> 06:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
technology messes up and then so do
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
humans but at least we can communicate
 
06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
and use compassion and really like get a
 
06:40:30.510 --> 06:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
message across so I support getting rid
 
06:40:33.350 --> 06:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the machines and that's
 
06:40:37.990 --> 06:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:42.230 --> 06:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Ann cop
 
06:40:44.468 --> 06:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
former R an where are you living now it
 
06:40:47.270 --> 06:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
says formally thank you madam chair
 
06:40:49.190 --> 06:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
honorable Ann cop standing before you
 
06:40:51.350 --> 06:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
former state representative the 2020
 
06:40:54.190 --> 06:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
election season I'd like to stay stand
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill 1064 I think the
 
06:40:59.590 --> 06:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
machines need to go and personal note in
 
06:41:01.590 --> 06:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry which Our Town clerks
 
06:41:03.990 --> 06:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
are here today thank you for being here
 
06:41:07.830 --> 06:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
the election um for 2020 the absentee
 
06:41:09.868 --> 06:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
ballots we had a total of 26,000
 
06:41:12.830 --> 06:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
registered voters 18,000 voters voted on
 
06:41:16.270 --> 06:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
on November 3rd and the absentee voters
 
06:41:16.280 --> 06:41:17.110 align:start position:0%
on November 3rd and the absentee voters
were

06:41:17.110 --> 06:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:41:20.708 --> 06:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
1836 it's over 10% I personally did a
 
06:41:22.310 --> 06:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
mailing to those people because the
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
secretary of state did not and I got
 
06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
over 300 returned postcards my data is
 
06:41:29.868 --> 06:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
solid it's still continuing and it's
 
06:41:31.628 --> 06:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
added in with Greenfield and any of the
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
other towns that have done their audits
 
06:41:35.590 --> 06:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important for us to
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
focus in on the next election because
 
06:41:39.230 --> 06:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
the definition of insanity is to do the
 
06:41:41.070 --> 06:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
same thing over and over again expecting
 
06:41:43.310 --> 06:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
a different result the people here the
 
06:41:45.590 --> 06:41:45.600 align:start position:0%

06:41:55.070 --> 06:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the office have been usurped their
 
06:41:57.070 --> 06:41:57.080 align:start position:0%

06:41:59.430 --> 06:41:59.440 align:start position:0%

06:42:01.468 --> 06:42:01.478 align:start position:0%
Reps Hall when the representatives can't

06:42:04.628 --> 06:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
Representatives Hall that needs to stop

Marilyn Todd who sat across from me at a
 
06:43:47.350 --> 06:43:47.360 align:start position:0%

06:43:58.868 --> 06:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
last night I saw Dick Tracy the Attorney
 
06:44:01.350 --> 06:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
General say well just because it's
 
06:44:04.310 --> 06:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
unethical doesn't mean that it's illegal
 
06:44:06.628 --> 06:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
when I found out the memory cards once
 
06:44:09.388 --> 06:44:09.398 align:start position:0%
they leave our town clerks can be
 
06:44:13.590 --> 06:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
altered and there's no way to back into
 
06:44:16.830 --> 06:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
how I voted that is not
 
06:44:20.750 --> 06:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay I was in finance for 20 years we
 
06:44:22.948 --> 06:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
cashed out our drawer The Vault teller
 
06:44:25.310 --> 06:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
the bank the branch we had to go down to
 
06:44:27.190 --> 06:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
the penny every night when we
 
06:44:29.788 --> 06:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
closed when I worked at the hospital the
 
06:44:31.868 --> 06:44:31.878 align:start position:0%
narcotics we did the count of the
 
06:44:34.310 --> 06:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
narcotics together under dual control we
 
06:44:35.670 --> 06:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
had to make sure every tablet was
 
06:44:38.708 --> 06:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
accounted for I am all for
 
06:44:41.670 --> 06:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
automation I am not about working harder
 
06:44:44.270 --> 06:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm about working smarter but when there
 
06:44:48.430 --> 06:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
is no Integrity you lose the fundamental
 
06:44:49.948 --> 06:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
piece of our
 
06:44:52.110 --> 06:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
democracy if we don't have vote
 
06:44:55.270 --> 06:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
Integrity we have nothing we have lost
 
06:44:58.350 --> 06:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
it all I did not work seven years with
 
06:45:00.750 --> 06:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
DCF to save these two boys from a
 
06:45:03.070 --> 06:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
residential homes and growing up in that
 
06:45:05.628 --> 06:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
situation I did not dedicate my life and
 
06:45:08.708 --> 06:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
change my career path to be a nurse to
 
06:45:11.670 --> 06:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
give up on helping people I did not work
 
06:45:13.868 --> 06:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
this hard to live in this country where
 
06:45:16.708 --> 06:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
people like Chia who come from China can
 
06:45:19.270 --> 06:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
have freedom to stop
 
06:45:22.150 --> 06:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
now I believe with watermarks I believe
 
06:45:24.670 --> 06:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
with QR codes I believe with integrity
 
06:45:27.270 --> 06:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
and these voting machines and us doing
 
06:45:29.788 --> 06:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
some work we can get back to automation
 
06:45:31.670 --> 06:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
but right now I think we need to take a
 
06:45:34.070 --> 06:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
step backwards we need to take a step
 
06:45:36.430 --> 06:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
back under dual control we need to count
 
06:45:40.548 --> 06:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
our hand ballots and we had 30 cities in
 
06:45:44.628 --> 06:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
24 hours get the warn articles in on
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
Tuesday it was a small Fierce group of
 
06:45:51.110 --> 06:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
us but we have lost our jobs our
 
06:45:54.270 --> 06:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
schools our hospitals
 
06:45:54.280 --> 06:45:55.350 align:start position:0%
schools our hospitals
our

06:45:55.350 --> 06:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
06:45:58.070 --> 06:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
families and we're not going away and
 
06:46:00.548 --> 06:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
we're paying attention and we are going
 
06:46:02.910 --> 06:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
to get our voter Integrity back because
 
06:46:05.868 --> 06:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
without that we have nothing this
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
country means too much to us we elected
 
06:46:12.708 --> 06:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
you you work for us we shouldn't have to
 
06:46:14.708 --> 06:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
take time off we shouldn't have to get
 
06:46:16.510 --> 06:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
babysitters we shouldn't have to
 
06:46:18.590 --> 06:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
sacrifice to micromanage what's going on
 
06:46:21.230 --> 06:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
with our elected
 
06:46:23.948 --> 06:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
officials all right that's enough and
 
06:46:27.270 --> 06:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up here with understanding
 
06:46:29.910 --> 06:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire GOP our governor
 
06:46:32.868 --> 06:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
sinunu it's all about pharmaceutical
 
06:46:35.590 --> 06:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
covid money that has corrupted every
 
06:46:38.590 --> 06:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
fiber of this country and it's going to
 
06:46:41.708 --> 06:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
stop until I have not another breath
 
06:46:43.948 --> 06:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
left in my lungs I will fight for our
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:52.320 --> 06:47:04.868 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:47:04.868 --> 06:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:04.878 --> 06:47:16.110 align:start position:0%
 
ibody

06:47:16.110 --> 06:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:18.388 --> 06:47:18.398 align:start position:0%
Tom thank you madam chair members of the
 
06:47:20.468 --> 06:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom Murray Windham
 
06:47:20.478 --> 06:47:21.230 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tom Murray Windham
New

06:47:21.230 --> 06:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
New
 
06:47:23.910 --> 06:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I rise in in support of
 
06:47:27.430 --> 06:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
this bill before I begin I would just
 
06:47:29.150 --> 06:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
like to point out and I'm not sure if
 
06:47:31.548 --> 06:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
the committee members are aware the last
 
06:47:34.548 --> 06:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
Friday on January 7th there was an a
 
06:47:36.388 --> 06:47:36.398 align:start position:0%
there was a dual author by both
 
06:47:38.590 --> 06:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary State Gardner and Attorney
 
06:47:41.708 --> 06:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
General John fora and it regards to the
 
06:47:44.190 --> 06:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
Windam audit if you haven't already read
 
06:47:46.868 --> 06:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
this 11-page document I am going to
 
06:47:49.590 --> 06:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
highly suggest that you actually do so
 
06:47:51.708 --> 06:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to begin with a
 
06:47:55.468 --> 06:47:55.478 align:start position:0%
quote from this letter quote windham's
 
06:47:58.030 --> 06:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
election Night results were not just
 
06:48:01.150 --> 06:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
imprecise they were fundamentally
 
06:48:03.590 --> 06:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
flawed this is from our former Secretary
 
06:48:05.070 --> 06:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
State Bill Gardner and our attorney
 
06:48:06.868 --> 06:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
General John
 
06:48:09.750 --> 06:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
fella I appreciate the
 
06:48:12.190 --> 06:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of the issues that wind
 
06:48:15.070 --> 06:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
him in other municipalities throughout
 
06:48:18.990 --> 06:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
the state has endured during this 2020
 
06:48:19.000 --> 06:48:20.070 align:start position:0%
the state has endured during this 2020
election

06:48:20.070 --> 06:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
election
 
06:48:23.670 --> 06:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
cycle This truly is about election
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.350 --> 06:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
06:48:34.110 --> 06:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
believe with all my
 
06:48:37.230 --> 06:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
heart that the election officials wanted
 
06:48:40.628 --> 06:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing nevertheless we
 
06:48:44.990 --> 06:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
had errors and violations as well of
 
06:48:48.070 --> 06:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
election laws this committee passes
 
06:48:51.350 --> 06:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
those laws the fundamental issue there
 
06:48:54.670 --> 06:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
is no accountability as to what happens
 
06:48:56.708 --> 06:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
when I violate
 
06:49:00.548 --> 06:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
them not just by me but by our secretary
 
06:49:03.830 --> 06:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
of state and our attorney general wind's
 
06:49:08.350 --> 06:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:12.070 --> 06:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
monitor I'm sorry but a
 
06:49:13.990 --> 06:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
monitor that's
 
06:49:18.510 --> 06:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
it all these errors made and by the way
 
06:49:21.150 --> 06:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
this is consistent and pervasive
 
06:49:24.910 --> 06:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state all one has to do
 
06:49:28.510 --> 06:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
is go pull the tally tapes pick a
 
06:49:32.628 --> 06:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
town sand down I challenge you committee
 
06:49:36.230 --> 06:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
members to look at
 
06:49:39.910 --> 06:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
Sandown you will see that in fact
 
06:49:42.230 --> 06:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
Democrats were on the short end of the
 
06:49:45.270 --> 06:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
stick just like Republicans were in
 
06:49:49.948 --> 06:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
Windham in Windham we had the largest
 
06:49:52.548 --> 06:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
voting discrepancy in the Hampshire
 
06:49:54.270 --> 06:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
State history
 
06:49:56.590 --> 06:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
history I'll let that sink in for a
 
06:49:58.708 --> 06:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
minute and the
 
06:50:00.750 --> 06:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
cause is the
 
06:50:05.350 --> 06:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
machines during the audit of s
 
06:50:08.948 --> 06:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
sp43 we were never able to recreate the
 
06:50:12.388 --> 06:50:12.398 align:start position:0%
November 3rd election results
 
06:50:16.110 --> 06:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
never we ran all 10,000 ballots through
 
06:50:20.388 --> 06:50:20.398 align:start position:0%
machine 1 Machine 2 machine 3 machine 4
 
06:50:23.350 --> 06:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't even get them to line up
 
06:50:27.310 --> 06:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:29.910 --> 06:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
another and yet we are going to go
 
06:50:33.548 --> 06:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
through another election cycle using
 
06:50:35.708 --> 06:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
these same
 
06:50:39.468 --> 06:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
machines I don't understand
 
06:50:43.548 --> 06:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
that Mr Murray if you can at a minimum I
 
06:50:46.310 --> 06:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
think this is a good start to remove
 
06:50:46.320 --> 06:50:47.190 align:start position:0%
think this is a good start to remove
these

06:50:47.190 --> 06:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:50:49.830 --> 06:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
machines and from that point there's a
 
06:50:51.788 --> 06:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
lot of work that this committee has to
 
06:50:53.868 --> 06:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
do going forward thank you both for your
 
06:50:55.110 --> 06:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
time and thank you for allowing me to
 
06:50:58.388 --> 06:50:58.398 align:start position:0%
share my thoughts thank you Mr
 
06:51:08.070 --> 06:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:10.868 --> 06:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
iring thank you chair woman Griffin for
 
06:51:13.270 --> 06:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to talk and for all the
 
06:51:15.150 --> 06:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
honorable Representatives on this
 
06:51:18.708 --> 06:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
committee oh okay how's this okay thank
 
06:51:20.788 --> 06:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
you chair Warman
 
06:51:23.030 --> 06:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
Griffin for this opportunity to talk
 
06:51:25.350 --> 06:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
talk and for the time that I'm going to
 
06:51:27.590 --> 06:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
take and thank you honorable
 
06:51:30.310 --> 06:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives as well um I'm just
 
06:51:31.230 --> 06:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
06:51:34.628 --> 06:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
brief which I'm sure would be
 
06:51:36.670 --> 06:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
appreciated my problem with voting
 
06:51:38.310 --> 06:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
machines is
 
06:51:41.430 --> 06:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
that right now we have all of all of the
 
06:51:43.708 --> 06:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
machines across the state and in fact
 
06:51:46.430 --> 06:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
across the Northeast five or six
 
06:51:48.948 --> 06:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
different states they're all programmed
 
06:51:52.070 --> 06:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
by one company now we're trusting that
 
06:51:54.788 --> 06:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
that company does their job right we
 
06:51:57.190 --> 06:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
don't know that they do I'm not
 
06:51:59.468 --> 06:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
suggesting that anything nefarius is
 
06:52:01.468 --> 06:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
going on but if they make
 
06:52:03.948 --> 06:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
mistakes we're trusting that they're not
 
06:52:06.910 --> 06:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
making mistakes these are our elections
 
06:52:08.750 --> 06:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
this is all about election Integrity
 
06:52:10.830 --> 06:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to know that if their
 
06:52:13.468 --> 06:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
vote is cast that it's going to be
 
06:52:16.310 --> 06:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
counted and that the people who truly
 
06:52:18.670 --> 06:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
get the most vote should be serving in
 
06:52:21.310 --> 06:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
office so that's one of my issues with
 
06:52:24.150 --> 06:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
the machines uh they could be loaded
 
06:52:24.160 --> 06:52:25.430 align:start position:0%
the machines uh they could be loaded
with

06:52:25.430 --> 06:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:52:28.750 --> 06:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
malware um and we would never know Harry
 
06:52:31.830 --> 06:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
Hy one of the Auditors for the Windham
 
06:52:35.788 --> 06:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
audit this past spring uh testified be
 
06:52:37.388 --> 06:52:37.398 align:start position:0%
before the house election law Committee
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
in 2007 stating just that with our
 
06:52:43.548 --> 06:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
machines so that is a
 
06:52:45.708 --> 06:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
possibility although I'm not suggesting
 
06:52:47.830 --> 06:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
that anybody would do that again we
 
06:52:50.270 --> 06:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't know and we have no mechanisms no
 
06:52:52.230 --> 06:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
way to verify and validate that our
 
06:52:53.868 --> 06:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
machines are set up properly that they
 
06:52:56.110 --> 06:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
counted the votes properly and that the
 
06:52:57.750 --> 06:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
end results that are being reported to
 
06:53:02.030 --> 06:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office are
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
accurate and the other the other issue
 
06:53:08.230 --> 06:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that if if there are overvotes on the
 
06:53:10.510 --> 06:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
ballots they right now they get sucked
 
06:53:11.708 --> 06:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
into the
 
06:53:16.270 --> 06:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
machine voters votes for specific races
 
06:53:19.548 --> 06:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
if if there is an issue with the machine
 
06:53:23.388 --> 06:53:23.398 align:start position:0%
Mal malfunction their votes are
 
06:53:26.110 --> 06:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised a perfect example was
 
06:53:29.310 --> 06:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
wiam November 3rd 2020 where we had
 
06:53:32.270 --> 06:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds I think it was 420 votes that
 
06:53:33.670 --> 06:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
were counted as
 
06:53:35.670 --> 06:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
overvotes and what happened is the
 
06:53:37.548 --> 06:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
machines malfunctioned they counted
 
06:53:40.270 --> 06:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
additional votes for the State Rep race
 
06:53:42.670 --> 06:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
when there were no overvotes and that's
 
06:53:45.350 --> 06:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
a problem after the audit between
 
06:53:48.670 --> 06:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
November 3D the margin of discrepancy
 
06:53:51.708 --> 06:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
between the fourth place Republican in a
 
06:53:57.510 --> 06:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
four four- seat race and the fifth place
 
06:54:01.388 --> 06:54:01.398 align:start position:0%
Democrat was 24 votes after a state
 
06:54:06.110 --> 06:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
recount that grew to 420 votes that's
 
06:54:11.868 --> 06:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
0.005% margin of loss to 99.6% margin of
 
06:54:14.350 --> 06:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
loss there were
 
06:54:17.510 --> 06:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
1,163 votes that were shifted from
 
06:54:21.310 --> 06:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
election day and then after the recount
 
06:54:23.910 --> 06:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of votes that were moved
 
06:54:26.788 --> 06:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
around considering there were only 10,6
 
06:54:29.948 --> 06:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
ballots cast and that's all due to the
 
06:54:32.830 --> 06:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
inaccuracy of the machines so with that
 
06:54:34.750 --> 06:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to thank you again I do
 
06:54:37.708 --> 06:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
support this bill and thank you for your
 
06:54:39.750 --> 06:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
time does anybody have any questions
 
06:54:42.830 --> 06:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative prom o' Brien thank you
 
06:54:44.830 --> 06:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here you
 
06:54:47.548 --> 06:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
too I had a little bit of trouble
 
06:54:50.788 --> 06:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
hearing your entire testimony I'm
 
06:54:53.350 --> 06:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I have a question and it's about
 
06:54:57.708 --> 06:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
the January 7 report I skimmed a little
 
06:54:59.070 --> 06:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
bit of it
 
06:55:03.510 --> 06:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I read that that only a few
 
06:55:06.310 --> 06:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
ballots one maybe six ballots something
 
06:55:08.070 --> 06:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
like that went through the machines
 
06:55:10.708 --> 06:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
during the testing period that is
 
06:55:12.070 --> 06:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen to all of the
 
06:55:13.750 --> 06:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting machines
 
06:55:15.430 --> 06:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
prior to every
 
06:55:19.548 --> 06:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
election and when those checks are done
 
06:55:22.070 --> 06:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
is 50 ballots are put in there and
 
06:55:24.948 --> 06:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
they're put in in every orientation
 
06:55:24.958 --> 06:55:25.788 align:start position:0%
they're put in in every orientation
that's

06:55:25.788 --> 06:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:55:28.708 --> 06:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
conceivable so then you can check the
 
06:55:30.868 --> 06:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
the the tally yourself a citizen can
 
06:55:34.070 --> 06:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
watch this and what happened in wiam
 
06:55:36.350 --> 06:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
what I said was there was only like six
 
06:55:37.830 --> 06:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
ballots that went
 
06:55:40.510 --> 06:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
through do you think if they had adhered
 
06:55:43.350 --> 06:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
to state law that is in place right now
 
06:55:46.070 --> 06:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
that this this these problems that you
 
06:55:48.430 --> 06:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
had in Windham would not have occurred
 
06:55:50.670 --> 06:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
that that would have safeguarded the the
 
06:55:54.670 --> 06:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
election in Windham no not in this case
 
06:55:57.948 --> 06:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
because what caused the problems were uh
 
06:56:00.868 --> 06:56:00.878 align:start position:0%
the mail and ballots were folded and the
 
06:56:03.270 --> 06:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
folds went across the ovals that got
 
06:56:06.388 --> 06:56:06.398 align:start position:0%
filled in that caused an imperfection in
 
06:56:08.708 --> 06:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
the ballot it caused the machine to
 
06:56:11.750 --> 06:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
misread and and think of that uh oval
 
06:56:13.468 --> 06:56:13.478 align:start position:0%
was being filled in when it wasn't and
 
06:56:15.910 --> 06:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
that triggered overvotes and that's why
 
06:56:19.628 --> 06:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
a candidate when people voted for less
 
06:56:23.350 --> 06:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
than the number allowed the Democratic
 
06:56:25.070 --> 06:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
candidate which is where the folds
 
06:56:27.628 --> 06:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
mostly went through her oval uh she
 
06:56:29.948 --> 06:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
gained votes she actually lost 99 votes
 
06:56:32.190 --> 06:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
in the recount so she gained 99 votes
 
06:56:36.070 --> 06:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
due to machine error and um and so that
 
06:56:38.030 --> 06:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
was a mechanical error that has nothing
 
06:56:39.628 --> 06:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
to do with the testing you're right the
 
06:56:41.430 --> 06:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
testing was an issue too they didn't
 
06:56:44.910 --> 06:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
follow the law but um that wouldn't have
 
06:56:47.510 --> 06:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
resolved the issue on November
 
06:56:52.510 --> 06:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
3D follow up I know that you more than
 
06:56:55.468 --> 06:56:55.478 align:start position:0%
anyone else I can think of you and Mr um
 
06:56:58.788 --> 06:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
Murray watched this very closely and and
 
06:57:03.270 --> 06:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
do you know if the if the uh the town
 
06:57:05.388 --> 06:57:05.398 align:start position:0%
clerks throughout the state were were
 
06:57:07.830 --> 06:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
advised about the use of a folding
 
06:57:09.990 --> 06:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
machine do you know if that happened no
 
06:57:12.788 --> 06:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
you have to ask them okay thank
 
06:57:15.548 --> 06:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
you further
 
06:57:17.708 --> 06:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you for
 
06:57:20.150 --> 06:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
your testimony that is the last person I
 
06:57:22.590 --> 06:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
have signed up to speak on this bill I
 
06:57:24.230 --> 06:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
want to thank you all for coming and
 
06:57:27.030 --> 06:57:27.040 align:start position:0%

have two more hearings for this
 
06:57:31.230 --> 06:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
committee some of you have signed up for
 
06:57:33.670 --> 06:57:33.680 align:start position:0%

06:57:38.548 --> 06:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
1157 is going to start in 10 minutes and

counting devices the prime sponsor of
 
07:12:22.190 --> 07:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
the bill would Norm Al introduce the
 
07:12:24.430 --> 07:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill to get the bill in front of the
 
07:12:27.190 --> 07:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee procedurally uh representative
 
07:12:30.350 --> 07:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
to roian had to leave so representative
 
07:12:33.350 --> 07:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
Hayward has agreed to stand in his place
 
07:12:35.230 --> 07:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill welcome
 
07:12:38.030 --> 07:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hayward thank you madam
 
07:12:40.350 --> 07:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I am as mentioned

representative Pete Hayward from
 
07:12:44.388 --> 07:12:44.398 align:start position:0%
straford County district one the towns
 
07:12:48.230 --> 07:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
of Milton and Middleton and HB 1157 is
 
07:12:51.948 --> 07:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
fairly simple bill it uh
 
07:12:57.750 --> 07:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
puts into the law that our uh devices
 
07:12:59.910 --> 07:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be hooked up to the Internet
 
07:13:02.830 --> 07:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's already the current practice it's
 
07:13:06.510 --> 07:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh but it is not in law and this bill
 
07:13:10.310 --> 07:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
puts it into law thank any
 
07:13:12.388 --> 07:13:12.398 align:start position:0%
questions does anybody have any
 
07:13:16.388 --> 07:13:16.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:18.990 --> 07:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hayward you're getting away with it okay
 
07:13:21.510 --> 07:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hayward you're set all
 
07:13:31.548 --> 07:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:33.670 --> 07:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
Gargano welcome to the election
 
07:13:36.670 --> 07:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank you is this on okay yes
 
07:13:38.708 --> 07:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
it is just get as close to the mic as
 
07:13:41.150 --> 07:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
you can especially with the mask thank
 
07:13:42.948 --> 07:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
07:13:44.670 --> 07:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Katie Gargano and I'm a new
 
07:13:46.910 --> 07:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
face of the Secretary of State's office
 
07:13:49.990 --> 07:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you all um I'm here to
 
07:13:51.388 --> 07:13:51.398 align:start position:0%
represent on the
 
07:13:52.868 --> 07:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that we're
 
07:13:54.430 --> 07:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill because the
 
07:13:56.310 --> 07:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
current machines are not connected to
 
07:13:58.628 --> 07:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
the internet and we don't foresee any of
 
07:14:00.708 --> 07:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
the machines um in the future to be
 
07:14:02.430 --> 07:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
approved by the ballot log commission
 
07:14:04.030 --> 07:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
that would then be connected to the
 
07:14:05.590 --> 07:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
internet as
 
07:14:08.868 --> 07:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
well thank you thanks does anybody have
 
07:14:08.878 --> 07:14:10.910 align:start position:0%
well thank you thanks does anybody have
any

07:14:10.910 --> 07:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:14:13.750 --> 07:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions no we are not moving the bill
 
07:14:16.190 --> 07:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
just based on that testimony
 
07:14:17.868 --> 07:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
Representatives I know we are all
 
07:14:19.788 --> 07:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
getting a little silly here all right
 
07:14:26.150 --> 07:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:28.670 --> 07:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
Chester Mike can
 
07:14:31.468 --> 07:14:31.478 align:start position:0%
you Mike can you help her with the mic
 
07:14:33.270 --> 07:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
oh no she's got it she's thank you so
 
07:14:36.628 --> 07:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
much though um my name is ranne Chester
 
07:14:39.070 --> 07:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
as uh many of the other um committees
 
07:14:41.030 --> 07:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
have now said I'm a frequent flyer here
 
07:14:43.350 --> 07:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
at the state house um I will be here on
 
07:14:45.310 --> 07:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
a regular basis because I feel that I do
 
07:14:47.788 --> 07:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
need to micromanage my um elected
 
07:14:50.910 --> 07:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
representatives and that's a shame uh so
 
07:14:53.350 --> 07:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to I I believe in
 
07:14:55.310 --> 07:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
transparency I'm just putting it out
 
07:14:58.510 --> 07:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
there letting you all know that I am
 
07:15:01.548 --> 07:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
being very very observant of everything
 
07:15:03.310 --> 07:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
you folks are doing the votes you're
 
07:15:05.190 --> 07:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
making the votes you're not making as
 
07:15:08.468 --> 07:15:08.478 align:start position:0%
well as the arguments um that being said
 
07:15:12.310 --> 07:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
this is 1157 correct yes okay that being
 
07:15:16.628 --> 07:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
said um I support this bill however I
 
07:15:20.070 --> 07:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
strongly I strongly oppose um any
 
07:15:22.910 --> 07:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
electronic devices at all being used in
 
07:15:25.990 --> 07:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
our ballots or in our election process
 
07:15:29.548 --> 07:15:29.558 align:start position:0%
um I was in computer programming and um
 
07:15:31.990 --> 07:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
back in the day when the CPU would be in
 
07:15:34.190 --> 07:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
this room and that's what the only thing
 
07:15:35.788 --> 07:15:35.798 align:start position:0%
that would be in this room is the CPU
 
07:15:38.070 --> 07:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the people working on it um and back
 
07:15:42.150 --> 07:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
in that day the the the um common phrase
 
07:15:44.510 --> 07:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
was garbage in garbage out the only
 
07:15:46.830 --> 07:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
thing those machines can do is what a
 
07:15:49.110 --> 07:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
human is telling them to do and that
 
07:15:52.350 --> 07:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
human is no longer h face so you don't
 
07:15:55.548 --> 07:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
know about their integrity and machines
 
07:15:57.350 --> 07:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't have integrity they're not meant
 
07:16:01.270 --> 07:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
to have integrity um so that being said
 
07:16:04.548 --> 07:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill because uh I
 
07:16:06.270 --> 07:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be connected into
 
07:16:08.230 --> 07:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
the internet the other thing I want to
 
07:16:12.628 --> 07:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
take um want to point out is that as you
 
07:16:18.030 --> 07:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
folks all know uh much of our much of um
 
07:16:20.670 --> 07:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
the hacking that goes on today on the
 
07:16:22.750 --> 07:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
dark web and some of those other things
 
07:16:24.750 --> 07:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
are not necessarily connected to the
 
07:16:26.628 --> 07:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
internet and they still manage to get
 
07:16:28.910 --> 07:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
our information so just the fact that
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
the machines are not physically
 
07:16:33.670 --> 07:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet does not mean
 
07:16:35.788 --> 07:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
someone's not gaining access to them
 
07:16:38.910 --> 07:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
they are a computer computers can be
 
07:16:38.920 --> 07:16:41.110 align:start position:0%
they are a computer computers can be
programmed

07:16:41.110 --> 07:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
programmed
 
07:16:47.868 --> 07:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
um out of the area to act and react from
 
07:16:51.868 --> 07:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
a phone going off in the uh elction room
 
07:16:54.750 --> 07:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
from uh I mean there are millions and
 
07:16:59.030 --> 07:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
trillions of ways to activate internet
 
07:17:01.750 --> 07:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
access without being physically plugged
 
07:17:06.030 --> 07:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
in so in that in that case I'm saying I
 
07:17:08.468 --> 07:17:08.478 align:start position:0%
would support this however I think we
 
07:17:09.868 --> 07:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
need to get rid of the machines all
 
07:17:12.030 --> 07:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
together thank you any
 
07:17:14.468 --> 07:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
questions that's my
 
07:17:18.070 --> 07:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
line I'm getting good at this all right
 
07:17:24.150 --> 07:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:26.590 --> 07:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
Lori uh my name is Robert Lori I'm from
 
07:17:29.190 --> 07:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
the town of Danville
 
07:17:32.350 --> 07:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's kind of low pick it
 
07:17:35.830 --> 07:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
up I'm here in speaking in support of
 
07:17:39.548 --> 07:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
this bill um I don't have a lot of faith
 
07:17:41.948 --> 07:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
in technology and the internet and I
 
07:17:45.468 --> 07:17:45.478 align:start position:0%
find that although people are talking
 
07:17:48.110 --> 07:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
about machines and so forth having very
 
07:17:51.628 --> 07:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
little error and people
 
07:17:53.990 --> 07:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
also having comparable small amounts of
 
07:17:55.750 --> 07:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
error like as in the counting as we
 
07:17:57.548 --> 07:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
discussed in the earlier
 
07:17:59.628 --> 07:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
bill I think the problem is there's an
 
07:17:59.638 --> 07:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
bill I think the problem is there's an
interface

07:18:01.430 --> 07:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
interface
 
07:18:04.708 --> 07:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
and when you're adding you you add those
 
07:18:06.388 --> 07:18:06.398 align:start position:0%
errors together it's not like the
 
07:18:09.190 --> 07:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
machines cancel out the human error or
 
07:18:10.948 --> 07:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
the human error cancels out the machine
 
07:18:13.030 --> 07:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
error I think you're adding them
 
07:18:14.708 --> 07:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
together because for
 
07:18:17.628 --> 07:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
myself uh I'm not very good with
 
07:18:19.788 --> 07:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
technology and I'm on several committees
 
07:18:21.190 --> 07:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
in my town
 
07:18:22.990 --> 07:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
and we have a very glitchy internet
 
07:18:23.000 --> 07:18:24.388 align:start position:0%
and we have a very glitchy internet
service

07:18:24.388 --> 07:18:24.398 align:start position:0%
service
 
07:18:28.868 --> 07:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
there and our system isn't particularly
 
07:18:32.350 --> 07:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
secure so when we're using the internet
 
07:18:33.830 --> 07:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
or we're using that technology we're
 
07:18:36.788 --> 07:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
adding that human error which were all
 
07:18:39.670 --> 07:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
susceptible to to the errors in in
 
07:18:41.948 --> 07:18:41.958 align:start position:0%
technology so I'm actually glad to hear
 
07:18:44.868 --> 07:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
that with this law we would not never be
 
07:18:47.110 --> 07:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet because I
 
07:18:49.388 --> 07:18:49.398 align:start position:0%
think that adds a lot of uh insecurity
 
07:18:52.830 --> 07:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
to it you all know it's I've been hacked
 
07:18:54.590 --> 07:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
several times on my computer and on my
 
07:18:58.070 --> 07:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
phone so it makes it very
 
07:19:00.350 --> 07:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
accessible to the
 
07:19:04.230 --> 07:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
outside for people not within our town
 
07:19:08.070 --> 07:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
so I am here standing in favor of this
 
07:19:10.230 --> 07:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
film thank
 
07:19:16.110 --> 07:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:16.120 --> 07:19:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
trelli

07:19:19.430 --> 07:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:19.440 --> 07:19:32.388 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

07:19:32.388 --> 07:19:32.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:36.708 --> 07:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I uh chairman Griffin I I handed
 
07:19:38.548 --> 07:19:38.558 align:start position:0%
that in too early too that's for
 
07:19:41.830 --> 07:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
1247 but I will say I support this bill
 
07:19:43.990 --> 07:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
um that our machine should not be uh
 
07:19:46.388 --> 07:19:46.398 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet should I fill
 
07:19:48.070 --> 07:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
out another card or will you shift it
 
07:19:50.948 --> 07:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
over I want to speak for 1247
 
07:19:54.388 --> 07:19:54.398 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Tom Tom Murray and I am
 
07:19:55.910 --> 07:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
double checking here it looks like this
 
07:19:59.948 --> 07:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:59.958 --> 07:20:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
on

07:20:02.030 --> 07:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:20:04.670 --> 07:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
right everybody else knew that I didn't
 
07:20:04.680 --> 07:20:05.430 align:start position:0%
right everybody else knew that I didn't
there

07:20:05.430 --> 07:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:20:08.150 --> 07:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
you uh Tom muray Windam New Hampshire
 
07:20:10.628 --> 07:20:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you again um yeah I just wanted to
 
07:20:13.948 --> 07:20:13.958 align:start position:0%
rise to um support this bill um I don't
 
07:20:16.830 --> 07:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
believe that our devices should ever be
 
07:20:18.670 --> 07:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
connected to the internet for various
 
07:20:21.150 --> 07:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
reasons um
 
07:20:23.788 --> 07:20:23.798 align:start position:0%
obviously knowing what we know now after
 
07:20:26.948 --> 07:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
the 2020 election with all the uh
 
07:20:28.628 --> 07:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
problems that we had throughout the
 
07:20:31.030 --> 07:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
nation um I was
 
07:20:33.830 --> 07:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
happy to learn that we were not
 
07:20:35.750 --> 07:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
connected in fact the wires were cut the
 
07:20:37.708 --> 07:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
modems were removed from all of our
 
07:20:40.868 --> 07:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
devices but going forward if we I don't
 
07:20:44.190 --> 07:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
support machines in general ever I'm I'm
 
07:20:46.788 --> 07:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
a firm believer in hand counts um
 
07:20:49.510 --> 07:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
especially as small of a state as we are
 
07:20:52.070 --> 07:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um but if there there was ever a uh time
 
07:20:54.510 --> 07:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
where we were looking at another device
 
07:20:56.670 --> 07:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't support those election
 
07:20:58.468 --> 07:20:58.478 align:start position:0%
machines due to the fact that most of
 
07:21:01.310 --> 07:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
them have a proprietary code um the ones
 
07:21:04.310 --> 07:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
we use right now the acub basic machines
 
07:21:06.110 --> 07:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
have a proprietary code I think I
 
07:21:08.150 --> 07:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe everything should be open source
 
07:21:11.230 --> 07:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
and I think you're just adding even more
 
07:21:14.590 --> 07:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
um possibilities um to the uh swaying of
 
07:21:16.110 --> 07:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
Elections by opening these up to
 
07:21:18.150 --> 07:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
internet so I do support the bill and I
 
07:21:20.070 --> 07:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
think it would uh take care of a problem
 
07:21:32.750 --> 07:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:36.430 --> 07:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
you well thank you uh Madame chair I um
 
07:21:38.150 --> 07:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
I bring my credit card here I just want
 
07:21:40.830 --> 07:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
to show you that I did not know this but
 
07:21:42.830 --> 07:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
in the past few years I've learned that
 
07:21:44.468 --> 07:21:44.478 align:start position:0%
if you put your credit card in your
 
07:21:46.830 --> 07:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
pocket or your purse and you just sit in
 
07:21:50.468 --> 07:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
the public place the thief can still all
 
07:21:51.350 --> 07:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
of your
 
07:21:53.590 --> 07:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
information that's why ever since I only
 
07:21:57.510 --> 07:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
bring one credit card with a low limit
 
07:22:01.110 --> 07:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
so without disconnected to anything they
 
07:22:03.468 --> 07:22:03.478 align:start position:0%
they can get your information so of
 
07:22:06.270 --> 07:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
course I I'm I'm supporting to get rid
 
07:22:09.190 --> 07:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
of all of the machine but we cannot chew
 
07:22:11.230 --> 07:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
the whole cake then we can have to buy
 
07:22:13.750 --> 07:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
the small piece to finish it if we
 
07:22:16.510 --> 07:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
cannot um I would like to support this
 
07:22:16.520 --> 07:22:18.310 align:start position:0%
cannot um I would like to support this
bill

07:22:18.310 --> 07:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:22:21.868 --> 07:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
1157 because
 
07:22:26.830 --> 07:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
um I watched the um uh recount at the uh
 
07:22:29.150 --> 07:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
wiam audit for 15 days I was there
 
07:22:31.150 --> 07:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
straight every day from morning to the
 
07:22:36.628 --> 07:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
Clos it right and I see that Harry hsty
 
07:22:39.750 --> 07:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who's in charge of that
 
07:22:43.190 --> 07:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
audit he was the one that
 
07:22:46.350 --> 07:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
discover that he can hack everything
 
07:22:49.510 --> 07:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
without even touching anything in the
 
07:22:51.430 --> 07:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
80s on the '90s
 
07:22:55.830 --> 07:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
so now is 2020 something and he's the
 
07:22:57.628 --> 07:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
one now standing saying that it cannot
 
07:22:57.638 --> 07:22:58.430 align:start position:0%
one now standing saying that it cannot
be

07:22:58.430 --> 07:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:23:01.788 --> 07:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
hacked and not only that the last few
 
07:23:05.548 --> 07:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
days um of the audit is when they open
 
07:23:08.430 --> 07:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
the machines so they can check the
 
07:23:10.510 --> 07:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
hardware inside and stuff like that
 
07:23:12.868 --> 07:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
there were three
 
07:23:16.628 --> 07:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
Auditors only he was there the other two
 
07:23:20.430 --> 07:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
gone only he physically there and you
 
07:23:22.788 --> 07:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
know what I keep complaining like you
 
07:23:24.990 --> 07:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
know we are not the expert in this
 
07:23:26.910 --> 07:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
industry We Don't Know Jack about
 
07:23:29.708 --> 07:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
machine or the the never my election
 
07:23:31.308 --> 07:23:31.318 align:start position:0%
machine on
 
07:23:34.270 --> 07:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
programming and we no expert he's say oh
 
07:23:35.788 --> 07:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
yeah people are watching through the
 
07:23:39.868 --> 07:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
zoom now I was there from the first day
 
07:23:42.230 --> 07:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
observing everything you cannot see
 
07:23:44.910 --> 07:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
anything even if you in the
 
07:23:48.628 --> 07:23:48.638 align:start position:0%
room the scanning thing is so blurry you
 
07:23:50.670 --> 07:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
cannot read anything if you stand in
 
07:23:53.230 --> 07:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
front of it so at the end of the first
 
07:23:55.468 --> 07:23:55.478 align:start position:0%
week on Friday that's when they change
 
07:23:57.270 --> 07:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
to a different machine so you can see a
 
07:24:00.230 --> 07:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
bit better but the thing is those camera
 
07:24:02.270 --> 07:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
they pointing all over the places not
 
07:24:04.150 --> 07:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
where you want them to be and like I
 
07:24:06.510 --> 07:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
said they zigzag ballot all over the
 
07:24:10.628 --> 07:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
places so that audit is not an audit
 
07:24:13.190 --> 07:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
especially not a forensic audit for
 
07:24:17.910 --> 07:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
certain I guarantee you that so no
 
07:24:20.510 --> 07:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
connecting Internet to the machine
 
07:24:23.510 --> 07:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
is the the right thing to do but the
 
07:24:26.510 --> 07:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
better thing to do is to get rid of all
 
07:24:30.350 --> 07:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
machines together thank
 
07:24:34.150 --> 07:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:36.910 --> 07:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
you anybody have any questions I don't
 
07:24:39.270 --> 07:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
think so that is the last person I have
 
07:24:42.070 --> 07:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on
 
07:24:44.190 --> 07:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
1157 is there anybody else here who
 
07:24:47.510 --> 07:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on 1157 thank you um I'm
 
07:24:49.230 --> 07:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing and
 
07:24:50.788 --> 07:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
that is of course subject to I
 
07:24:51.830 --> 07:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand there are probably lots of
 
07:24:53.350 --> 07:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
blue sheets out there that I'm going to
 
07:24:54.750 --> 07:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
need to pick up at the conclusion of
 
07:25:16.750 --> 07:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:19.230 --> 07:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
you at this time I'd like to open the
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
public hearing on 11 excuse
 
07:25:27.548 --> 07:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
me 1247 relating to folded B ballots the
 
07:25:30.388 --> 07:25:30.398 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is uh representative
 
07:25:32.308 --> 07:25:32.318 align:start position:0%
Moffett and he is here to introduce the
 
07:25:33.510 --> 07:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill to the committee welcome
 
07:25:33.520 --> 07:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
bill to the committee welcome
representative

07:25:35.110 --> 07:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:25:39.350 --> 07:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
M thank you madam
 
07:25:48.788 --> 07:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:48.798 --> 07:25:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
bit

07:25:51.750 --> 07:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
bit
 
07:25:52.868 --> 07:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you it's great to be back in
 
07:25:54.430 --> 07:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
rep's Hall I don't know where everybody
 
07:25:56.070 --> 07:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
went I was looking forward to speaking
 
07:25:58.670 --> 07:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
to a crowd but it's not going to happen
 
07:26:01.270 --> 07:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
apparently uh but anyway uh I have
 
07:26:02.868 --> 07:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
shared electronic correspondence with
 
07:26:06.030 --> 07:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
the committee earlier
 
07:26:09.628 --> 07:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
and uh I do want to just mention that uh
 
07:26:12.270 --> 07:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
this is election lot issues that were a
 
07:26:14.230 --> 07:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
little bit personal for me because I was
 
07:26:17.548 --> 07:26:17.558 align:start position:0%
in a race once it ended in a tie and in
 
07:26:20.590 --> 07:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
the recount I lost uh one vote off my
 
07:26:24.110 --> 07:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
total so uh every vote does
 
07:26:27.628 --> 07:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
count so this bill is intended uh to
 
07:26:29.868 --> 07:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of Under and Over
 
07:26:32.430 --> 07:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
reported or Under and Over votes that
 
07:26:35.830 --> 07:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
seem to occur when folded ballots are
 
07:26:38.910 --> 07:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
fed through a ballot counting machine
 
07:26:40.628 --> 07:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous reported
 
07:26:42.830 --> 07:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
problems with folded ballots as you've
 
07:26:45.350 --> 07:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
heard in the AC vote machines as you've
 
07:26:49.990 --> 07:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
heard so well uh in dairy uh in the
 
07:26:52.830 --> 07:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
November 2020 election I'm told that
 
07:26:54.990 --> 07:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
they reported
 
07:26:59.070 --> 07:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
572 overvotes on the seven uh other
 
07:27:02.670 --> 07:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
machines in use overall there were 848
 
07:27:06.230 --> 07:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
overvotes or votes lost because of the
 
07:27:10.070 --> 07:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
machines the AG was asked to investigate
 
07:27:13.590 --> 07:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
in Dairy I'm told but that did not
 
07:27:16.070 --> 07:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
happen uh Windom of course as you know
 
07:27:17.830 --> 07:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
so well there was an audit that showed
 
07:27:20.628 --> 07:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
that the folded ballots were a problem
 
07:27:23.868 --> 07:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
in this case attributed to the ballots
 
07:27:27.030 --> 07:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
not being folded in the correct places
 
07:27:29.948 --> 07:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
so this bill would have eliminated the
 
07:27:32.510 --> 07:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
miscount in Windam had this statute been
 
07:27:35.750 --> 07:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
in place at that time so numerous
 
07:27:38.110 --> 07:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
moderators have reported having the
 
07:27:40.388 --> 07:27:40.398 align:start position:0%
machines not accept folded ballots
 
07:27:43.388 --> 07:27:43.398 align:start position:0%
unless they repeatedly tried to reinsert
 
07:27:47.030 --> 07:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the ballots maybe in different you know
 
07:27:50.308 --> 07:27:50.318 align:start position:0%
orientations and and finally earlier
 
07:27:52.708 --> 07:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
uh this committee did hear uh plenty of
 
07:27:55.110 --> 07:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh on a bill that would
 
07:27:57.150 --> 07:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
entirely eliminate the use of ballot
 
07:27:59.670 --> 07:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
counting machines now this bill while
 
07:28:02.308 --> 07:28:02.318 align:start position:0%
making more ballots or requiring more
 
07:28:05.468 --> 07:28:05.478 align:start position:0%
ballots to be handled or handc counted
 
07:28:07.868 --> 07:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
uh would not be nearly as drastic as as
 
07:28:07.878 --> 07:28:08.750 align:start position:0%
uh would not be nearly as drastic as as
that

07:28:08.750 --> 07:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:28:12.548 --> 07:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
proposal so that's my uh my testimony be
 
07:28:14.590 --> 07:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
07:28:17.430 --> 07:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative any
 
07:28:20.350 --> 07:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative prudom br Brian
 
07:28:22.548 --> 07:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for coming here
 
07:28:22.558 --> 07:28:24.150 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for coming here
today

07:28:24.150 --> 07:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:28:26.708 --> 07:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh I think that the dairy issue will be
 
07:28:28.830 --> 07:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
addressed later on so I won't get to
 
07:28:31.788 --> 07:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
that but do you think it's possible that
 
07:28:34.708 --> 07:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
these these
 
07:28:38.830 --> 07:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
um that the the issue is really with the
 
07:28:41.548 --> 07:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
the fold going through a a target a vote
 
07:28:44.030 --> 07:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
Target and that if that were to not
 
07:28:46.670 --> 07:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
happen that this problem would be
 
07:28:50.070 --> 07:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated that in that manner as well
 
07:28:53.070 --> 07:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative PR I'm
 
07:28:54.670 --> 07:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that part about the
 
07:28:57.230 --> 07:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
vote Target do you think if the if there
 
07:29:00.030 --> 07:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
was other ways to eliminate a a fold
 
07:29:02.830 --> 07:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
going through a vote Target that would
 
07:29:05.868 --> 07:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
solve this problem as well such as
 
07:29:08.788 --> 07:29:08.798 align:start position:0%
education of sure thank you for your
 
07:29:10.708 --> 07:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
question so I think you're referring to
 
07:29:12.948 --> 07:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
the way the ballot would be inserted in
 
07:29:17.430 --> 07:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
the machine sure with a vote Target uh
 
07:29:20.030 --> 07:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is something that I'm sure could
 
07:29:21.788 --> 07:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
possibly make a difference it to me it
 
07:29:25.590 --> 07:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
seems really fairly simple to insert the
 
07:29:27.468 --> 07:29:27.478 align:start position:0%
ballot the machine is usually somebody
 
07:29:31.388 --> 07:29:31.398 align:start position:0%
standing right there uh so a better vote
 
07:29:36.270 --> 07:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
Target uh why not U if that could could
 
07:29:38.468 --> 07:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
help alleviate the way the ballot enters
 
07:29:42.190 --> 07:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
the machine okay thank you any further
 
07:29:46.030 --> 07:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent thank
 
07:29:48.430 --> 07:29:48.440 align:start position:0%

Christina Guilford Dair town and school
 
07:30:03.510 --> 07:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
moderator um I've worked elections for
 
07:30:06.388 --> 07:30:06.398 align:start position:0%
many many years in March of 20120 I was
 
07:30:08.910 --> 07:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
elected Town
 
07:30:12.788 --> 07:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
moderator um 2020 had its challenges
 
07:30:14.708 --> 07:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
with more absentee ballots than we've
 
07:30:15.868 --> 07:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
ever seen
 
07:30:18.750 --> 07:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
before after the November election we
 
07:30:21.590 --> 07:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
did have about about 800 overvotes on
 
07:30:25.910 --> 07:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
our sheet we are a Pick 10 town so that
 
07:30:29.110 --> 07:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
means voters have to count and choose 10
 
07:30:31.628 --> 07:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
you'll be surprised how difficult that
 
07:30:36.868 --> 07:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
is um we also had um an Undeclared
 
07:30:39.590 --> 07:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
candidate so they were picking 10 from
 
07:30:39.600 --> 07:30:41.070 align:start position:0%
candidate so they were picking 10 from
21

07:30:41.070 --> 07:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
21
 
07:30:44.510 --> 07:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
candidates again for someone who may not
 
07:30:46.590 --> 07:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
be voting a straight ballot that can be
 
07:30:46.600 --> 07:30:47.948 align:start position:0%
be voting a straight ballot that can be
very

07:30:47.948 --> 07:30:47.958 align:start position:0%
very
 
07:30:51.590 --> 07:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
difficult so while we do have overvotes
 
07:30:54.628 --> 07:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
they may not all be from
 
07:30:58.230 --> 07:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
folds however after seeing the report
 
07:30:59.468 --> 07:30:59.478 align:start position:0%
out of
 
07:31:02.830 --> 07:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
Windam I cannot in good conscience put a
 
07:31:05.868 --> 07:31:05.878 align:start position:0%
folded ballot through these
 
07:31:10.548 --> 07:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
machines um in fact I have not we have
 
07:31:14.430 --> 07:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
handc counted the absentees since then
 
07:31:16.868 --> 07:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
and I know there's a lot of talk about
 
07:31:18.110 --> 07:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
tossing the
 
07:31:23.948 --> 07:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
machines well in Derry we had 18,000
 
07:31:27.510 --> 07:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
voters sitting to figure out how many
 
07:31:30.190 --> 07:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
people you'd need to hire to count those
 
07:31:32.230 --> 07:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
ballots in a timely
 
07:31:34.308 --> 07:31:34.318 align:start position:0%
fashion the Constitution says the
 
07:31:36.110 --> 07:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
moderator counts the ballots and needs
 
07:31:37.548 --> 07:31:37.558 align:start position:0%
to do so in
 
07:31:40.750 --> 07:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
public at the end of the meeting
 
07:31:43.750 --> 07:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
time so our polls are open from 7:00
 
07:31:46.628 --> 07:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
a.m. to 8:00 p.m. we would then need to
 
07:31:46.638 --> 07:31:48.030 align:start position:0%
a.m. to 8:00 p.m. we would then need to
start

07:31:48.030 --> 07:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
start
 
07:31:50.750 --> 07:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
counting and in my mind we would need to
 
07:31:52.910 --> 07:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
do so that day so we'd need to have them
 
07:31:54.750 --> 07:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
counted by
 
07:31:57.510 --> 07:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
midnight that's a lot of
 
07:32:00.708 --> 07:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
ballots I honestly feel
 
07:32:03.708 --> 07:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
that putting a straight ballot through
 
07:32:07.230 --> 07:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
the machine a flat ballot and putting a
 
07:32:10.708 --> 07:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
folded ballot in the hand count is
 
07:32:10.718 --> 07:32:12.070 align:start position:0%
folded ballot in the hand count is
perfect

07:32:12.070 --> 07:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
07:32:15.830 --> 07:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
idea many people who vote at home don't
 
07:32:19.590 --> 07:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
use pen I've seen ballots in crayon I've
 
07:32:21.788 --> 07:32:21.798 align:start position:0%
seen ballots with a
 
07:32:24.230 --> 07:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
highlighter you'd be surprised what some
 
07:32:26.190 --> 07:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
of these absentee ballots come in
 
07:32:28.990 --> 07:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
looking like and we can fold it
 
07:32:31.628 --> 07:32:31.638 align:start position:0%
perfectly when we send it out in the
 
07:32:34.270 --> 07:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
town from the town clerk's office as an
 
07:32:36.670 --> 07:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
absentee but then the voter gets it home
 
07:32:38.468 --> 07:32:38.478 align:start position:0%
and they open it up and maybe they don't
 
07:32:40.388 --> 07:32:40.398 align:start position:0%
send it back right away and they fold it
 
07:32:41.948 --> 07:32:41.958 align:start position:0%
and then they open it and then they fold
 
07:32:43.788 --> 07:32:43.798 align:start position:0%
it again and who knows where the folds
 
07:32:48.150 --> 07:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
end up and knowing now what I know from
 
07:32:51.070 --> 07:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
Windom you cannot put a folded ballot
 
07:32:54.230 --> 07:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:59.910 --> 07:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:04.708 --> 07:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:18.160 --> 07:33:20.708 align:start position:0%
 
Kelly

07:33:20.708 --> 07:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
Kelly
 
07:33:25.708 --> 07:33:25.718 align:start position:0%
the folded ballot um I happen to help um
 
07:33:28.990 --> 07:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
can I ring here and Inter tery group to
 
07:33:31.350 --> 07:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
do the uh special election in
 
07:33:35.270 --> 07:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
Danville and I I make it my duty to go
 
07:33:37.468 --> 07:33:37.478 align:start position:0%
and observe them as much as I could
 
07:33:40.948 --> 07:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
after the election November
 
07:33:44.990 --> 07:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the Observer have to stand so far
 
07:33:47.990 --> 07:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
away from where they open these fente
 
07:33:51.150 --> 07:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
ballot where they come in in okay and
 
07:33:53.030 --> 07:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
when so I complained so they finally
 
07:33:54.590 --> 07:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
allow me to stand
 
07:33:57.110 --> 07:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
near and as they open the ballot and
 
07:33:59.990 --> 07:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
read the name I wrote it down and they
 
07:34:03.270 --> 07:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
miscounted but they didn't know so I was
 
07:34:04.910 --> 07:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
like recalculating my name and I go
 
07:34:06.910 --> 07:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
through the names and then the moderator
 
07:34:08.548 --> 07:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
came over and asked me is there anything
 
07:34:11.190 --> 07:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm like yeah my number is off uh
 
07:34:14.750 --> 07:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
your number is off I have more so they
 
07:34:19.070 --> 07:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
recounted it and yeah so two big issues
 
07:34:22.070 --> 07:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
ues right here yes human do make mistake
 
07:34:25.308 --> 07:34:25.318 align:start position:0%
machine make bigger mistakes okay and
 
07:34:28.350 --> 07:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
the process to count the balance absente
 
07:34:29.990 --> 07:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
balance should be a separate process
 
07:34:31.468 --> 07:34:31.478 align:start position:0%
instead of putting in through the
 
07:34:33.468 --> 07:34:33.478 align:start position:0%
machine because there should be as many
 
07:34:36.150 --> 07:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
Observer there in the due process
 
07:34:38.230 --> 07:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
because only the two people here only
 
07:34:40.308 --> 07:34:40.318 align:start position:0%
those two know if they make mistake or
 
07:34:44.628 --> 07:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
not had I not there nobody know it was
 
07:34:48.510 --> 07:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
off so it's important that these folded
 
07:34:51.110 --> 07:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
Mach uh ballot and absentee ballots
 
07:34:53.590 --> 07:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
should be count all separately and by
 
07:34:56.510 --> 07:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
the way that was the only one that I was
 
07:34:59.308 --> 07:34:59.318 align:start position:0%
able to be that close to observe the
 
07:35:02.110 --> 07:35:02.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots the rest they are so
 
07:35:04.030 --> 07:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
far away I could not see
 
07:35:07.628 --> 07:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
anything so I support this bill and but
 
07:35:09.190 --> 07:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
the better thing is to get rid of all
 
07:35:12.030 --> 07:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
the machine thank you so much any
 
07:35:17.030 --> 07:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
question any questions no thank
 
07:35:28.030 --> 07:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:31.430 --> 07:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not as tall as Mike is
 
07:35:35.150 --> 07:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm Alvin C I'm uh from
 
07:35:37.430 --> 07:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
lden and I'm representing myself and I'm
 
07:35:40.590 --> 07:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill uh I did want to
 
07:35:43.110 --> 07:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
follow up on a question that represent
 
07:35:45.830 --> 07:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
impr Brian had asked about the
 
07:35:47.948 --> 07:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
machines um Alvin can you get a little
 
07:35:50.150 --> 07:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic thanks the tip it up a
 
07:35:53.788 --> 07:35:53.798 align:start position:0%
little more perfect the um Windam audit
 
07:35:56.150 --> 07:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
definitely showed that with folds
 
07:35:59.030 --> 07:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
through the voting targets that that is
 
07:35:59.040 --> 07:36:00.230 align:start position:0%
through the voting targets that that is
a

07:36:00.230 --> 07:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:36:03.948 --> 07:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
problem however there are many uh
 
07:36:06.030 --> 07:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
reports of machines and and we just
 
07:36:09.910 --> 07:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
heard about uh Dairy where there the
 
07:36:12.670 --> 07:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
machine that they use for absentee
 
07:36:17.070 --> 07:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
ballots shows far higher number of
 
07:36:20.948 --> 07:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
overvotes in that report now the report
 
07:36:23.948 --> 07:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't show what office had the
 
07:36:27.708 --> 07:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
overvote it just gives a total uh there
 
07:36:29.270 --> 07:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's another way that there might be
 
07:36:31.030 --> 07:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
an overvote
 
07:36:34.468 --> 07:36:34.478 align:start position:0%
problem because the rollers that take
 
07:36:36.190 --> 07:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
the paper and feed it through the
 
07:36:39.110 --> 07:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
machine are not at the same place where
 
07:36:42.270 --> 07:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
the uh glass rods are that has the
 
07:36:42.280 --> 07:36:43.708 align:start position:0%
the uh glass rods are that has the
optical

07:36:43.708 --> 07:36:43.718 align:start position:0%
optical
 
07:36:46.590 --> 07:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
sensors that when that fold goes through
 
07:36:49.308 --> 07:36:49.318 align:start position:0%
the roller it may make the paper bounce
 
07:36:51.628 --> 07:36:51.638 align:start position:0%
at the sensor which may be an inch or
 
07:36:56.590 --> 07:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
two away from where the actual U fold is
 
07:36:59.830 --> 07:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
we we don't know that information so
 
07:37:02.628 --> 07:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
we're only guessing is what might happen
 
07:37:07.150 --> 07:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
so and uh as as a followup to that
 
07:37:11.030 --> 07:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill will uh help
 
07:37:13.910 --> 07:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
alleviate the problem I have noticed
 
07:37:17.308 --> 07:37:17.318 align:start position:0%
after the last general election through
 
07:37:20.308 --> 07:37:20.318 align:start position:0%
a number of blog sites and and other
 
07:37:24.788 --> 07:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
places reports of various discrepancies
 
07:37:26.868 --> 07:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
between one machine and another that
 
07:37:28.910 --> 07:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
should have had the same number of
 
07:37:31.510 --> 07:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
votes uh machines
 
07:37:36.190 --> 07:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
that um were used exclusively for
 
07:37:39.468 --> 07:37:39.478 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots my town aladen has just
 
07:37:41.750 --> 07:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
uses one machine so all the absentee
 
07:37:44.070 --> 07:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
votes go through the same machine and
 
07:37:46.270 --> 07:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
there's no way of knowing other than
 
07:37:48.430 --> 07:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the top and saying that oh
 
07:37:52.670 --> 07:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah were 100 or 200 or so overvotes but
 
07:37:54.590 --> 07:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know where they are and the
 
07:37:58.388 --> 07:37:58.398 align:start position:0%
only option for the candidates is to ask
 
07:38:00.150 --> 07:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
for a
 
07:38:02.670 --> 07:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
recount uh I'll take any questions if
 
07:38:04.750 --> 07:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
you have any do committee members have
 
07:38:04.760 --> 07:38:06.388 align:start position:0%
you have any do committee members have
any

07:38:06.388 --> 07:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:38:12.708 --> 07:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:17.708 --> 07:38:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:17.718 --> 07:38:20.468 align:start position:0%
 
Chester

07:38:20.468 --> 07:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
Chester
 
07:38:20.478 --> 07:38:24.590 align:start position:0%
Chester
once

07:38:24.590 --> 07:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:27.830 --> 07:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
again folks I'm in support of this bill
 
07:38:31.230 --> 07:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
um I um again want to restate I would
 
07:38:33.750 --> 07:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
rather get the machines out of our state
 
07:38:35.590 --> 07:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
however I understand that a lot of
 
07:38:37.590 --> 07:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
people are saying well that's a lot of
 
07:38:40.110 --> 07:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
work and that's a lot of money and
 
07:38:43.230 --> 07:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of time I don't care the
 
07:38:45.948 --> 07:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
bottom line is when I went to the Double
 
07:38:50.270 --> 07:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
Tree on January 5th and six and I heard
 
07:38:51.990 --> 07:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
a representative say well I don't want
 
07:38:54.150 --> 07:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
to have to be here on Friday so can we
 
07:38:55.388 --> 07:38:55.398 align:start position:0%
just table
 
07:38:58.788 --> 07:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
this that's unacceptable and this is the
 
07:39:01.190 --> 07:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
same type of unacceptable
 
07:39:05.388 --> 07:39:05.398 align:start position:0%
response we have we have we uh as the
 
07:39:07.308 --> 07:39:07.318 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and you as our
 
07:39:09.308 --> 07:39:09.318 align:start position:0%
elected representatives have the
 
07:39:11.548 --> 07:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility to put the power of the
 
07:39:14.868 --> 07:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
people back into the hands of the people
 
07:39:17.910 --> 07:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
um some of you may not remember the 2000
 
07:39:21.150 --> 07:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
election where we had a Democratic
 
07:39:23.468 --> 07:39:23.478 align:start position:0%
president C presidential candidate for
 
07:39:27.110 --> 07:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
what a week 12 days and then all of a
 
07:39:29.190 --> 07:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
sudden o hanging
 
07:39:32.830 --> 07:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
chars that was a machine issue they
 
07:39:32.840 --> 07:39:34.190 align:start position:0%
chars that was a machine issue they
solved

07:39:34.190 --> 07:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
solved
 
07:39:37.190 --> 07:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
it and now there's another machine issue
 
07:39:39.990 --> 07:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
and another machine issue Harry hery one
 
07:39:41.830 --> 07:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the things he said in that audit and
 
07:39:43.830 --> 07:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
I was not at that audit but I saw it
 
07:39:47.110 --> 07:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
live and 90% of the time watching it
 
07:39:48.590 --> 07:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
being a former computer progam
 
07:39:51.350 --> 07:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
programmer being someone that understood
 
07:39:54.388 --> 07:39:54.398 align:start position:0%
what he was doing I just sat there like
 
07:39:56.868 --> 07:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
oh my god did he just really do that did
 
07:40:00.708 --> 07:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
he just really say that what when did he
 
07:40:04.670 --> 07:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
sell out because in 2005 he was very
 
07:40:07.190 --> 07:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
much against voting machines and he
 
07:40:09.990 --> 07:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to a number of people how
 
07:40:12.468 --> 07:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
exactly how voting machines can be
 
07:40:15.150 --> 07:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
manipulated and controlled by nefarious
 
07:40:17.350 --> 07:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
entities now is that what happened or
 
07:40:19.388 --> 07:40:19.398 align:start position:0%
was it clearly just a mistake of the
 
07:40:22.388 --> 07:40:22.398 align:start position:0%
machine I don't know it's not my
 
07:40:24.830 --> 07:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
job but I want to bring that to your
 
07:40:27.150 --> 07:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
attention um
 
07:40:30.788 --> 07:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
2016 2016 the first person to ever I
 
07:40:33.308 --> 07:40:33.318 align:start position:0%
remember ever talking about election
 
07:40:33.318 --> 07:40:34.308 align:start position:0%
remember ever talking about election
election

07:40:34.308 --> 07:40:34.318 align:start position:0%
election
 
07:40:38.308 --> 07:40:38.318 align:start position:0%
fraud was Hillary Rodman Clinton she was
 
07:40:41.548 --> 07:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
very very clear in 2016 that that
 
07:40:44.868 --> 07:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
election had been stolen from her bottom
 
07:40:47.830 --> 07:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
line so this is definitely not a
 
07:40:50.190 --> 07:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
partisan issue isue if the Democrats in
 
07:40:53.150 --> 07:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
2016 were saying the election was stolen
 
07:40:55.830 --> 07:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the Republicans in 2020 saying the
 
07:40:59.388 --> 07:40:59.398 align:start position:0%
election was stolen maybe it was really
 
07:41:03.388 --> 07:41:03.398 align:start position:0%
stolen both times I don't know not my
 
07:41:03.398 --> 07:41:05.110 align:start position:0%
stolen both times I don't know not my
job

07:41:05.110 --> 07:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
job
 
07:41:07.270 --> 07:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
lastly there's no such thing as a
 
07:41:07.280 --> 07:41:08.270 align:start position:0%
lastly there's no such thing as a
perfect

07:41:08.270 --> 07:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
07:41:12.030 --> 07:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
storm any storm is not perfect that was
 
07:41:14.030 --> 07:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
another quote out of Harry Hershey's
 
07:41:17.308 --> 07:41:17.318 align:start position:0%
mouth so we had the fos and then we had
 
07:41:19.350 --> 07:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
this and then we had Windom not
 
07:41:21.468 --> 07:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
following the law and we had so we had
 
07:41:23.388 --> 07:41:23.398 align:start position:0%
all these different things that just
 
07:41:25.590 --> 07:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
lined up perfectly and created a perfect
 
07:41:28.990 --> 07:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
storm I'm sorry these are our elections
 
07:41:32.270 --> 07:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
these are our lives we can't afford a
 
07:41:36.308 --> 07:41:36.318 align:start position:0%
storm we can't afford even one aspect of
 
07:41:37.868 --> 07:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
a perfect
 
07:41:42.990 --> 07:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
storm thank you for taking my comments
 
07:41:44.910 --> 07:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions or comments
 
07:41:45.708 --> 07:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
back at
 
07:41:48.750 --> 07:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
me I'm not seeing any thank you okay
 
07:42:07.308 --> 07:42:07.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:10.190 --> 07:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
iring hi thank you again for the
 
07:42:12.868 --> 07:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk um I'm going to be
 
07:42:14.070 --> 07:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
very very
 
07:42:16.708 --> 07:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
quick um I just want to reiterate that
 
07:42:18.910 --> 07:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer that we at at this point in
 
07:42:20.788 --> 07:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
time get rid of the machines as opposed
 
07:42:22.670 --> 07:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
to addressing the
 
07:42:26.510 --> 07:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
issue but um as I pointed out before in
 
07:42:28.628 --> 07:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
my previous testimony and I don't know
 
07:42:30.308 --> 07:42:30.318 align:start position:0%
if it's worthwhile to go through again
 
07:42:31.948 --> 07:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
because it's a different bill for the
 
07:42:34.468 --> 07:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
record uh but you know all of my reasons
 
07:42:36.308 --> 07:42:36.318 align:start position:0%
that I brought up before are applicable
 
07:42:38.708 --> 07:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
here uh the machines are not always
 
07:42:41.110 --> 07:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
accurate and in the case of the Windam
 
07:42:43.030 --> 07:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
November 3rd election it's because some
 
07:42:46.190 --> 07:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
ballots were folded across one of the
 
07:42:49.030 --> 07:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
ovals um predominantly one oval it did
 
07:42:51.548 --> 07:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
cross over other ovals as well but
 
07:42:53.430 --> 07:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
predominantly for one candidate that one
 
07:42:57.670 --> 07:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
candidate gained 99 votes and in the
 
07:42:58.990 --> 07:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
instance that it was a straight
 
07:43:02.590 --> 07:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
Republican ticket and the Democrat whose
 
07:43:06.430 --> 07:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
oval was crossed over with one of the
 
07:43:08.350 --> 07:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
folds in the ballots it triggered an
 
07:43:10.430 --> 07:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
overvote you can see by the results of
 
07:43:10.440 --> 07:43:11.110 align:start position:0%
overvote you can see by the results of
the

07:43:11.110 --> 07:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:43:13.590 --> 07:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
machines that it was quite significant
 
07:43:16.150 --> 07:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that's what triggered uh the
 
07:43:18.910 --> 07:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
difference between 24 votes for the
 
07:43:22.468 --> 07:43:22.478 align:start position:0%
losing margin of the leading Democrat to
 
07:43:25.830 --> 07:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
420 votes after the recount so you know
 
07:43:27.990 --> 07:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
with that I think it's pretty clear that
 
07:43:29.910 --> 07:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh it'd be much more safer much more
 
07:43:33.628 --> 07:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
accurate to hand count um mail and
 
07:43:36.070 --> 07:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
ballots and I think that pretty much
 
07:43:47.190 --> 07:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:47.200 --> 07:43:48.750 align:start position:0%

News uh overseas 76 countries I have
 
07:44:37.750 --> 07:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
been involved in the coverage of many
 
07:44:40.590 --> 07:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
elections in the 70s 80s and 90s the
 
07:44:43.070 --> 07:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
last one was the East German election
 
07:44:45.708 --> 07:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
when there was an East
 
07:44:49.230 --> 07:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
Germany I've spent three Winters in m
 
07:44:53.430 --> 07:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
go and absentee ballots to me mean a
 
07:44:56.990 --> 07:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
lot and as a result of what happened in
 
07:45:01.190 --> 07:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
2020 with the flurry to invite people to
 
07:45:04.308 --> 07:45:04.318 align:start position:0%
have absentee ballots because of the
 
07:45:07.430 --> 07:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
situation absentee ballots used to
 
07:45:11.788 --> 07:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
require a reason and a notary in the
 
07:45:13.990 --> 07:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
places where I used to live I voted in
 
07:45:17.548 --> 07:45:17.558 align:start position:0%
1984 election on an absentee ballot and
 
07:45:19.308 --> 07:45:19.318 align:start position:0%
delivered it to the American Embassy in
 
07:45:21.788 --> 07:45:21.798 align:start position:0%
Rome to work its way to
 
07:45:25.548 --> 07:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
Florida many of our military vote
 
07:45:27.628 --> 07:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
absentee many of the people that are
 
07:45:29.990 --> 07:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
Homebound and can't get out many of the
 
07:45:31.510 --> 07:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
people that may be in traveling
 
07:45:33.430 --> 07:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
situations that they can't get back like
 
07:45:37.070 --> 07:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
I was for many many years can't get back
 
07:45:39.990 --> 07:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
to have an absentee ballot thrown out
 
07:45:42.510 --> 07:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
because it was misread by modern
 
07:45:46.150 --> 07:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
technology Optical and I am a technology
 
07:45:49.388 --> 07:45:49.398 align:start position:0%
guy to have an optical Reed throw that
 
07:45:52.350 --> 07:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
out reminds me of a phrase that is
 
07:45:55.150 --> 07:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
attributed to and I'm going to say this
 
07:45:58.750 --> 07:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
name in this Hall Joseph
 
07:46:01.990 --> 07:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
Stalin it's not who
 
07:46:05.510 --> 07:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
votes it's who counts and I'm going to
 
07:46:09.190 --> 07:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
say what counts the
 
07:46:12.830 --> 07:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
votes that that determines the winner
 
07:46:15.430 --> 07:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay spent a lot of time in a lot of
 
07:46:17.430 --> 07:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
places watching a lot of really horrible
 
07:46:19.190 --> 07:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
things in and getting it back for you to
 
07:46:21.948 --> 07:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
watch it home because I'm out
 
07:46:26.308 --> 07:46:26.318 align:start position:0%
there and to watch how we treat absy
 
07:46:29.628 --> 07:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
ballots regular ballots with
 
07:46:31.830 --> 07:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
machines why are those other compan
 
07:46:34.510 --> 07:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
countries forcing hand ballots because
 
07:46:37.350 --> 07:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's sacred and we're
 
07:46:38.948 --> 07:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
ignoring it and when you think of the
 
07:46:41.270 --> 07:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
military that are out serving us to have
 
07:46:42.948 --> 07:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballots come in because
 
07:46:44.590 --> 07:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's a fold that's not in the right
 
07:46:47.110 --> 07:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
place as it was sent out and have an
 
07:46:49.788 --> 07:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
optical scan or misread it and count it
 
07:46:50.590 --> 07:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
as an
 
07:46:54.270 --> 07:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
overvote no so I'd like for 1064 to go
 
07:46:56.868 --> 07:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
through so that 1247 doesn't have to be
 
07:46:59.308 --> 07:46:59.318 align:start position:0%
dealt with okay thank you very much for
 
07:47:02.750 --> 07:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
your time thank you any
 
07:47:13.670 --> 07:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:16.110 --> 07:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
Penza So based upon the last bill you
 
07:47:18.190 --> 07:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
know what I feel about in regards with
 
07:47:21.628 --> 07:47:21.638 align:start position:0%
folds and fold gate and
 
07:47:24.948 --> 07:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
sp43 and as I stated
 
07:47:27.830 --> 07:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
previously this election law uh house
 
07:47:29.910 --> 07:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
committee knew that folds were going to
 
07:47:33.030 --> 07:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
be a problem did nothing this bill
 
07:47:35.910 --> 07:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
should have actually been enacted before
 
07:47:39.788 --> 07:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
votes were counted in 2020 but it wasn't
 
07:47:40.868 --> 07:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
what a
 
07:47:44.150 --> 07:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
shame I voted in Ry and I don't live in
 
07:47:46.990 --> 07:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
Rye anymore but I was a pole Watcher and
 
07:47:48.590 --> 07:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
so was my husband
 
07:47:52.830 --> 07:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
they have never seen the amount of
 
07:47:56.110 --> 07:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that came in it almost
 
07:47:58.590 --> 07:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
exceeded the amount of people that voted
 
07:48:01.430 --> 07:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
in person and as Brenda there was a
 
07:48:03.190 --> 07:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
woman that came up town was talking
 
07:48:05.868 --> 07:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
about we were part of the people that
 
07:48:08.230 --> 07:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
have canvased Rye so I'm just going to
 
07:48:10.990 --> 07:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
tell you about one house there were five
 
07:48:13.590 --> 07:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
votes in that one house only two were
 
07:48:14.868 --> 07:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
valid those are the two people that
 
07:48:17.430 --> 07:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
lived there the last three votes that
 
07:48:19.788 --> 07:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
had come come in in the 2020 election
 
07:48:21.468 --> 07:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
were the last three people that lived in
 
07:48:23.350 --> 07:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
that house that don't live in that house
 
07:48:26.788 --> 07:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
anymore and how did they all vote
 
07:48:29.628 --> 07:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
absentee during that whole ele there's
 
07:48:33.190 --> 07:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
only two machines in Rye one of those
 
07:48:35.708 --> 07:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
machines was off the charts when it
 
07:48:38.350 --> 07:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
comes to overvotes not of anything was
 
07:48:40.150 --> 07:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
looked at of course I talked to the town
 
07:48:42.468 --> 07:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
moderator I reported everything that I
 
07:48:44.868 --> 07:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
had to the AG as well and my husband
 
07:48:47.788 --> 07:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
reported all of that as well and to um
 
07:48:50.030 --> 07:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire GOP it fell on deaf
 
07:48:50.040 --> 07:48:51.830 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire GOP it fell on deaf
ears

07:48:51.830 --> 07:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
ears
 
07:48:55.388 --> 07:48:55.398 align:start position:0%
nothing so we have a this bill is is
 
07:48:57.150 --> 07:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
perfect and I would love all of these
 
07:48:59.750 --> 07:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
things to be of course hand counted but
 
07:49:02.350 --> 07:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
I don't want machines anymore at all we
 
07:49:04.510 --> 07:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
can make it happen we can do it you have
 
07:49:06.430 --> 07:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
other countries we're little old New
 
07:49:09.388 --> 07:49:09.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can do it Canada can do it
 
07:49:11.670 --> 07:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can do it it's not that
 
07:49:13.548 --> 07:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
big of a deal to be able to be able to
 
07:49:16.388 --> 07:49:16.398 align:start position:0%
get this done so I really wish that this
 
07:49:19.308 --> 07:49:19.318 align:start position:0%
was introduced I wish it was applied uh
 
07:49:21.150 --> 07:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
I wish that we had some more safeguards
 
07:49:23.670 --> 07:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
in Ry for example they weren't even
 
07:49:23.680 --> 07:49:24.708 align:start position:0%
in Ry for example they weren't even
matching

07:49:24.708 --> 07:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
matching
 
07:49:27.110 --> 07:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
signatures I heard about that from many
 
07:49:30.230 --> 07:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
other towns and so if you want to talk
 
07:49:33.708 --> 07:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
about foldgate this was a problem I know
 
07:49:36.510 --> 07:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
for a fact sand as we talked about
 
07:49:40.110 --> 07:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
Sandown was a problem in Milford it was
 
07:49:43.190 --> 07:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
a problem um in Waterville Valley and I
 
07:49:45.628 --> 07:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
can go on and on so just if you look at
 
07:49:49.150 --> 07:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
Ry alone that was over 100% voter
 
07:49:51.548 --> 07:49:51.558 align:start position:0%
turnout because of those absentee
 
07:49:54.830 --> 07:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
ballots that's statistically impossible
 
07:49:57.190 --> 07:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at their last three
 
07:50:00.270 --> 07:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
presidential elections Federal elections
 
07:50:03.430 --> 07:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
they had barely 70% vote they were lucky
 
07:50:05.868 --> 07:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
they were high 60s at one point that's
 
07:50:08.750 --> 07:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
30% fraud let's not be the first in the
 
07:50:12.110 --> 07:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
nation for fraud thanks thank you does
 
07:50:13.910 --> 07:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
07:50:16.830 --> 07:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not seeing any that is the
 
07:50:18.670 --> 07:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
last speaker that I have signed up to
 
07:50:20.868 --> 07:50:20.878 align:start position:0%

07:50:22.830 --> 07:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
