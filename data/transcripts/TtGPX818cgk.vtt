I'm here alone in my office in Hanover, New Hampshire.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you, Representative Bernstein.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're going to start the first public hearing, which was scheduled for 9 o'clock.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And since I'm going to be testifying, Vice Chairman, Representative Bromney is going to take over.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,500
I open the public hearing on House Bill 306.

70
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Relative to revenue estimates while operating under emergency orders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

71
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Just so everyone knows, the only one signed up to justify is Representative Major.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
So Representative Major, please introduce yourself.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Thank you, Representative Obramny.

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:37,000
House Bill 306, relative to revenue estimates while operating under these conditions, What this bill does, it just backs up what we're doing by statute.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And what we're doing is we're trying to react to the revenues as the revenues are varying due to the pandemic and other causes.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That means we may end up doing revenue estimates every month for this fiscal year until the pandemic is over.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this backs up work done by statute.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That, wait a minute.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Representative Almey.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,500
The way this is worded, it applies only to the pandemic.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:25,500
And it means that in future emergencies, if we felt the need for this, that we'd have to put in another bill.

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:35,500
on do you think we ought to amend it to any emergency orders in the future or something like that?

84
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I think it stems partly from the difficulty we had getting some of the agencies to respond last fall when we were trying to get an update and last summer when we were trying to get an update on things.

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,000
I can respond to that.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I would rather keep this a clean bill and just have it exist during this pandemic.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,500
If I could just do a brief follow-up for the committee.

88
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,000
I went into the history of revenue estimates when I first became chair.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And none of what we do is actually in statute.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's just tradition that evolved since 1971, I think it was, when the Senate decided that there had to be a revenue estimate process.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The next year, they handed it over to the House.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Did you say Representative Ames?

94
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I didn't hear that.

95
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Okay.

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
You're really echoing, Pat.

97
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
I know you're doing your best.

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Sorry, my little idea.

99
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Wow.

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,000
So I'm really following up on Representative Alamey's question.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My sense is that this is not necessary, that the statutes clearly give us authority to proceed with estimates on our own schedule when we think it's important.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And so my question to Representative Major really is why do we need this?

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:40,500
It was recommended that I put this in in order to be able to back up what we've been doing, which is different than normal by stature and only make it available during the pandemic.

104
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Any follow-up?

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
No, no follow-up.

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Any other questions?

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:55,000
If there's any other members of the public on this Zoom call, would you like to speak?

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Please raise your hand.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,500
Can someone talk to that please, Jen?

110
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Excuse me?

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,000
Do you see any other hands up?

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,500
Any people in front of the public out there?

113
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
I do not.

114
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:19,500
So if there's no other questions, I'm going to close the hearing on Haskell.

115
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:41,500
It's been recommended that after you speak, you mute yourself, as well as representative major, and then those two devices won't be conflicting all right very good we're going to move on to our next bill i'm hoping to hearing on house bill 324.

116
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,000
The administration is being passed by the Department of Revenue Administration.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,500
And the current is once again the representative major.

118
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Thank you, Mr.

119
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Chairman.

120
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:11,000
This bill has been put in at the request of the Department of Revenue in order to be able to clear up, clean up some of the processes that they have.

121
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,500
And Carolyn Ward from, I believe it.

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Carolyn Lear will be here.

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Carolyn Lear will be here to explain.

124
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Okay, any questions?

125
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
President Major.

126
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
.

127
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
.

128
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
.

129
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
.

130
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
.

131
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
.

132
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
.

133
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
.

134
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
.

135
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
.

137
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
.

138
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
.

139
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
.

140
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Good morning, representatives.

141
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Carolyn Lear, assistant commissioner at the Department of Revenue here.

142
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Could someone give me at least a thumbs up that you can all hear me fine?

143
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes.

144
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
All right.

145
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm going to be pretty brief with you today because I hope that you all received the letter that we sent around explaining this legislation that we've requested.

146
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:41,000
I would characterize the bill as some technical cleanups as well as some hopefully statutory improvements that will sort of go well with our new revenue information management or RIMS system.

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,500
I think section one of the bill is by far the most significant change that we're asking for today.

148
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Currently under statute, all of our taxes are assessed interest on a daily basis.

149
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:12,500
And what that means is that a taxpayer could receive a bill on one day and then it is immediately wrong because the interest is accruing on a daily basis.

150
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:33,000
This bill would allow us to assess interest more like a credit card bill, which is to say that we would send a taxpayer a bill and the dollar value on that bill would be good for up to 30 days.

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And then if they hit that 30 day, the prior 30 days of interest will appear on their next bill.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:02,500
So we think this is a pretty taxpayer-friendly change, and it will also ease our administration because we find ourselves either billing or writing off these small balances of interest when taxpayers don't calculate their daily interest rate correctly.

153
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Sections two and three relates to the administration of the meals and rentals tax.

154
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,500
It eliminates telefiling from the statute because we have eliminated the ability to telefile.

155
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
Very few taxpayers used that.

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,500
Taxpayers have very successfully transitioned to using GTC and it's saving the department about $100,000 a year.

157
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:46,500
The fourth section relates to the department's tax expenditure report, and it eliminates a somewhat outdated calculation that we perform in that report related to the transition the transition from three-factor apportionment to three-factor apportionment with double-weighted sales.

158
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,500
As you all know, the state is now considering going to single sales factor.

159
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:05,000
We don't think that it's valuable to continue to compare the impact of going back to the way we did it in 1994.

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And then lastly, can I stop you there?

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:19,500
We actually have the same language cross out in in a bill that I filed on the single sales factor bill.

162
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Yes.

163
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,000
So I guess it does.

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,500
I guess these two will be reconciled if we we pass it with this language in here?

165
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes, and I believe the language is exactly the same.

166
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Okay, thank you.

167
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:49,500
And then the last section of this bill relates to the due dates in the business tax statute for nonprofits.

168
00:13:49,500 --> 00:14:03,500
As some of you recall, three or four years ago, the federal government changed their due dates for business taxes, and we mirrored those changes statutorily as well.

169
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Unfortunately, we were a bit unartful when we did that because we failed to accurately account for nonprofit filers, of which there are not many, but we just thought it was important that the statute accurately reflect the due date for nonprofits, which is actually May 15th for most filers.

170
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,000
With that, I will stop talking and I'm happy to answer any of your questions.

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Representative Alming.

172
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Are you still muted?

173
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

174
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I apologize.

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
I cannot find that letter.

176
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Could you tell us when you sent it or who sent it?

177
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,000
I sent it to the chair and your support staff on either Friday or Monday.

178
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,500
I forget, but I can absolutely send it around again, if that would be helpful.

179
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
That would be terrific.

180
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Thank you.

181
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
It was with the fiscal note that came.

182
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
It was attachments.

183
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Yeah, it was from Gen 4.

184
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,500
It was there were three or four attachments.

185
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
That's correct.

186
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
That's my understanding, too.

187
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,000
Bevacemi Almi, do you have a follow-up?

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're still muted.

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're muted.

190
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I muted you.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,500
I thought you were done.

192
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
You need to unmute.

194
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I apologize.

195
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Apparently the space bar doesn't work while I was searching.

196
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I found it.

197
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I have no follow-up and I shouldn't ask actual questions because I'm a co-sponsor.

198
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
That's right.

199
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,000
I just noticed that myself.

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,500
Representative Major wants to add something here.

201
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Okay.

202
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:20,000
For those that don't have the letter, what I would recommend is that we will resend that letter out.

203
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:32,500
And then we can discuss this on the 10th when we do a work study meeting, reviewing the bills that we have heard thus far.

204
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
That's it.

205
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Representative, how are you?

206
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Your hands are open.

207
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,000
I guess you're not in a lot.

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Good.

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,500
We can't hear you again, but I just wanted to make another comment.

210
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I have found it, and the reason that I couldn't find it is probably relevant to other people.

211
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,000
It is labeled DRAFNQG for two four hearings, which is a little cryptic.

212
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If it said quick guides, I would have gotten it open quicker.

213
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay, well we could talk to Jennifer about how we label things in the email.

215
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Thank you.

217
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Okay, any other questions?

218
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Is there any member of the public?

219
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,500
Jen, is there anybody else out there?

220
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Alan, We'll see you next time.

221
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Any questions?

222
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Okay, I see none.

223
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Is there any member of the public?

224
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Jen, is there anybody else out there?

225
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Allen?

226
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,000
There's one member of the public that has his hand raised.

227
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay.

228
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I will allow him to talk.

229
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yep.

230
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Kevin Kennedy, you're unmuted.

231
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Thank you.

232
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,500
My name is Kevin Kennedy.

233
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm a CPA here in New Hampshire.

234
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:36,500
I also am a trustee for the New Hampshire Society of CPAs, and I also sit on the Tax and Legislation Committee as co-chair, and I just wanted to comment that the conversations among the society are we do support this bill and the DRA's administrative changes.

235
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
That was it.

236
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Thank you very much.

237
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Any questions?

238
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Mr.

239
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Kennedy?

240
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Seeing none.

241
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Okay, I think we...

242
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I forgot to do this in the left first bill.

243
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,500
But here is one person signed up in support, and that was Eric Rathbotton.

244
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:10,500
With that, seeing no other hands, I'm going to close the hearing on House Bill 324.

245
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm going to hand the chair back over to Representative Major for the next bill.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, you're going to chair it, is it?

247
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We have House Bill, we have.

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We have another 528.

249
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
134.

250
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We have 528.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There's one in between.

252
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
528.

253
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay, yes.

254
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
528.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Sorry about that.

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Okay.

257
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I hope so we are good.

258
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We're running late.

259
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,500
I opened the public hearing on House Bill 528-FN relative to electronic filing of state tax returns.

261
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
And one second.

262
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
I got to find the seat.

263
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Representative Gonski is in.

264
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
The sponsor.

265
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Okay, Representative Gonski.

266
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
I am here.

267
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
Introduce the bill.

268
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Can everybody hear me?

269
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Yes.

270
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Thank you.

271
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
I am here.

272
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Introduce the bill.

273
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Can everybody hear me?

274
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Yes.

275
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Excellent.

276
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Having some of these difficulties in our committee, I completely understand what you're going through this morning.

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay.

278
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Good morning, Mr.

279
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,500
Chair and members of the Ways and Means Committee.

280
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:55,000
For the record, I am Representative Michael Gunsky, and I represent Hillsborough 6, the town of Gostown.

281
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,500
I was asked to file this legislation by my personal CPA, Jeff Chickering.

282
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Mr.

283
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Chickering has a small firm located in Manchester, and he prepares tax returns for a number of New Hampshire businesses.

284
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,000
Most of the information I will be providing has been provided by Mr.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Chickering, so I would ask that his testimony follow mine, and that if members of the committee have specific questions, it may be best for him to answer those for you.

286
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:45,000
At the present time, New Hampshire does not require electronic filing or e-filing of income and business tax returns.

287
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This includes individual returns, interest in dividends, tax returns, business tax returns such as business profits and business enterprise and also non-profit annual returns.

288
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:12,500
The bill you have in front of you puts in place an e-filing requirement for practitioners that will ensure that all vendors make their tax software capable for New Hampshire e-filing.

289
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:26,000
Just a little background, all New England states and New York, except the state of Vermont, and most states throughout the United States have mandated e-filing requirements.

290
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Certain professional tax software vendors will not make New Hampshire e-filing available unless it is required.

291
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,500
Some claiming the complexity of our New Hampshire tax code is a reason for not offering an e-filing product.

292
00:22:43,500 --> 00:23:00,000
This is a problem for a large number of practitioners in the state of New Hampshire, many of them small, as well as what I see as the New Hampshire Department of Revenue.

293
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Practitioners whose software vendors will not allow for e-filing must print returns, send them to their clients for signature, and then mail the returns to the DRA along with the appropriate copies of the federal tax return that are required by New Hampshire laws.

294
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:40,500
When the New Hampshire DRA receives the paper returns, they must scan them into their system, hard key all the data into the state's electronic system, and it seems to be hardly an effective or efficient system.

295
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:59,000
It seems to me it would be time consuming for the New Hampshire DRA employees and time could be allocated to areas such as providing better customer service as well as focusing on audits of tax returns.

296
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:11,500
This is the year 2021 and with the current pandemic situation it seems most everything around us is taking advantage of the technology we have.

297
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Submitting tax returns electronically that are being prepared in quantity by a tax preparer seems to me to be a logical solution, especially during a time with this COVID pandemic.

298
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Regarding the fiscal note, I see a positive impact to the Department of Revenue.

299
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:53,500
There should already be systems in place for approving software vendor requests, and I have to believe there would be efficiencies gained within the agencies with taking the bulk of the manual entry from the returns away from the employees.

300
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,500
And thank you for my testimony.

301
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
That sums it up.

302
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Thank you, Representative.

303
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Questions from the committee?

304
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Thank you, Representative.

305
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,000
Any questions from the committee?

306
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I've promoted Jefferson Chickering to panelists.

307
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Thank you, committee.

308
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay.

309
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Next, Jefferson Chickering.

310
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Hi, I'm here.

311
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Can everyone hear me?

312
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Yes.

313
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Thank you.

314
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
As Mike mentioned, I've been as accountant for several years.

315
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm a CPA in Manchester.

316
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,000
I've had my own firm since 2003.

317
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,500
I formerly served on the State Board of Accountancy.

318
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,500
I was appointed by Governor Benson in 2003, reappointed by Governor Lynch in 2008.

319
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:53,500
So I've been involved with a lot of accountancy legislation over a 10-year period.

320
00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:06,000
I also served on the National State Board of Accountancy, which kind of worked with all the states regarding accountancy legislation around the whole country.

321
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,500
I did that from 2010 to 2013.

322
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:24,500
And over the years, I've talked with Mike several times as I've done his work saying, you know, it's just so frustrating that vendors just will not comply with e-filing.

323
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Some vendors do, some vendors will not.

324
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So that's sort of the genesis of this bill in a sense that there's a whole history of e-filing when states came online, when they started doing it.

325
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:52,500
And then it sort of became, well, when states start requiring it, vendors certainly become compliant because they have no choice.

326
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,500
So that's sort of where we're at at this point in time.

327
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,000
And every vendor has a different perspective on e-filing.

328
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:14,500
Every year as I go to renegotiate my fees with my vendor, I say, is New Hampshire going to be e-fileable next year?

329
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:31,500
And the response every year is that it will only be, you only be able to e-file in New Hampshire if the state has a requirement that e-filing has to happen in New Hampshire.

330
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:39,500
So in essence, it's sort of what my discussions with my representative Gunsky have Thank you.

331
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,000
filing has to happen in New Hampshire.

332
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So in essence, it's sort of what my discussions with my representative Genski have revolved around.

333
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:01,000
A little more history, as far as my practice, I e-file in around 15 to 20 different states every year.

334
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,500
And I e-file in all of those states except my home state of New Hampshire.

335
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:16,500
And again, it's because my vendor will only make it available if New Hampshire requires e-filing.

336
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,500
My vendor offers about 45 states for e-filing.

337
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,000
The states that are not offered, of course, is New Hampshire.

338
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I'm just trying to give some examples to help with context.

339
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:43,000
New Hampshire, Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, and Wyoming are the states that are not required or my vendor does not make available.

340
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:53,500
And the interesting note on that is that Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, and Wyoming, they do not have business income taxes.

341
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
So they have a lot less tax filings.

342
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:08,000
But then it leaves New Hampshire, we have business income taxes, we have individual taxes, as far as interest and dividends.

343
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,500
We have many, many different types of taxes, and it's very complex here.

344
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:29,000
So basically, you get to the point where a lot of vendors just don't want to deal with making New Hampshire available for electronic filing, unless, again, it's required.

345
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So we kind of get into the complexity of New Hampshire law.

346
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:51,500
A lot of states that are available, there's sort of a piggybacking system you could call that when you file your federal return, your state return, just sort of go along with it.

347
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,500
They go through the IRS and then they go to the state.

348
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,500
So it's sort of a piggybacking.

349
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:21,000
And a lot of state laws have a relevant conformity to federal laws, where when we get to New Hampshire, we have the complex business enterprise tax, business profits tax, the personal compensation deduction, different rules for corporation dividends, partner distributions.

350
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,500
So it is very complex.

351
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:34,500
And that is sort of one of the reasons why some states may stay away from making e-file for New Hampshire available.

352
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,000
Again, unless it's a requirement, they may stay away from it.

353
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,500
I'd say right now, as far as I have counted, there's about 32 states in the country that have this requirement.

354
00:30:50,500 --> 00:31:05,000
And again, of those, of the 50 states, plus you can include DC as an entity of 51, 45 or 46 are available for e-filing through my specific vendor.

355
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,500
It's just those five states.

356
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,500
And of those five states, New Hampshire is the only one with business taxes.

357
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:28,500
So, so sort of, I know Mike touched on the Northeast states and we include Pennsylvania and New Jersey, New York, all of the six New England states.

358
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Only two of them don't have required e-filing.

359
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,000
That's New Hampshire and Vermont.

360
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
However, Vermont makes e-filing is available.

361
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,500
My vendor makes it available because it's less complex tax law.

362
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,500
So I e-file in Vermont all the time with clients.

363
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,500
We just can't do New Hampshire.

364
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:08,000
I guess some of my other notes are, you know, how this is sort of a win-win for the state, for the Department of Revenue, for practitioners, for all stakeholders in a sense.

365
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Sort of reviewing the fiscal note from the DRA.

366
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:37,500
I know like there's a lot of, what happens is they get all these paper returns and they, people have to sit and scan them in all the time, which they have to sort of get pulled off from what they're doing when they get a mad rush of returns.

367
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,500
They have to scan them in paper and then they have to review them.

368
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,500
And it's with a different methodology.

369
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:54,000
It just seems as just an opportunity cost lost by not requiring e-filing.

370
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,500
There's just resources that could be dedicated that way.

371
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,500
There isn't a whole department that approves e-filing, works specifically with vendors on e-filing.

372
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:56,000
There's a whole process already in place um there's one thing too even on the state returns in the upper left hand corner a lot of people can note that it always says do not staple so the department of revenue has on their forms to not staple their tax returns and i always found that curious and the reason they say that is because if you staple the returns before you send them to the Department of Revenue, they have problems scanning them in because they pull the staples out, it might tear some of the corners of the return.

373
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So if you're a practitioner like me, you have to print off New Hampshire returns, you have to print off a copy of the federal return.

374
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You can't, you don't staple it because the state says don't staple your return.

375
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,500
So you put it on a black binder clip.

376
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,500
You set it up to be mailed to your client.

377
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,000
Client receives it in the mail with a black binder clip.

378
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,500
They take the black binder clip off.

379
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:49,000
they sign it, they lose pieces, it gets to the DRA and oftentimes they'll get a notice saying we're missing this piece of paper, missing this piece of paper.

380
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's almost as if this, because this whole process just is inefficient for every stakeholder, it just can go sideways at times.

381
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So I mean, just simply put electronic filing requirement avoids all of these hassles.

382
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Thank you.

383
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So I mean, just simply put, electronic filing requirement avoids all of these hassles.

384
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
That's sort of most of what I wanted to share.

385
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,500
I do think it also levels the playing field from bigger firms and smaller firms.

386
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:42,000
Smaller firms don't always have the resources for the most complex tax software and the more complex and sophisticated tax softwares, they'll make New Hampshire e-filing available.

387
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Some of them do, some of them don't.

388
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So the smaller firms were at a disadvantage because we don't have a requirement.

389
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and our vendors may tend to ignore a state like New Hampshire that has more complex tax laws.

390
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So, I mean, even where I sit in my office here in the North London Manchester, I can count seven firms using the same software, excuse me, seven practitioners using the same software within a two mile radius of where I am.

391
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:39,500
So I don't have a number of how many firms in this specific software are using in New Hampshire, but I could estimate 50 to 75 perhaps, but that's just one software vendor.

392
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,500
There's many other vendors that will still not make New Hampshire available.

393
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,000
So that's most of what I wanted to share.

394
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,500
I just think New Hampshire's been way, way behind the times on this.

395
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,500
It's just time to do it.

396
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:05,500
So that's pretty much what I wanted to share with you guys.

397
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,000
And thank you for letting me give some testimony.

398
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm happy to answer and field any questions.

399
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you for your testimony, Mr.

400
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Chickering.

401
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,500
First question is Representative Brownlee.

402
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Thank you, Mr.

403
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Chair.

404
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,000
Thank you for your testimony.

405
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I've been in and out with technical difficulties.

406
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The line for the bill says a tax return should be required to take on a quick while tax return.

407
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:54,500
So why the bill went the other way around that providers of this technology should be required to offer a few messages to the future?

408
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Thank you.

409
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:47,500
around that the provider of this technology should be required to offer a message to the reason I say that there may be some small guys out there that still don't want to file electronically could be retired accountants that are doing maybe five parents or neighbors or whatever that are just going to do paper have you and also can you explain line six in the the bill where it says the 25 is that where it's handled that you have to prepare at least 25 that to how do we protect the guys that still want to do it manually?

410
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Sure.

411
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Yeah, I'm happy.

412
00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:01,000
I had a little trouble hearing you but I think I got gist of what you're saying, Representative Abrami.

413
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So let me try to address that particular part of the bill.

414
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So I don't think there's a goal of this bill to preclude anyone from being in business as a preparer.

415
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I think the intent of this bill is essentially for anyone using tax software to have a requirement to e-file if you file a certain amount of returns.

416
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Now, I understand what you're saying.

417
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:47,500
Yes, there's a lot of folks that may be retired and doing stuff part time, or sort of a hobby for them, they're a tax return preparer.

418
00:39:47,500 --> 00:40:01,500
And the response I have too is that it's very hard to prepare any taxes without any tax, without tax software, like actually physically preparing it by hand.

419
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,500
It's very uncommon at this point with technology.

420
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:54,000
However, the only amendment that I might propose to this is that there be an opt-out that you could get permission from the DRA if someone, Abrami in the in the situation that you're mentioning simply doesn't have the technology available to them then there should be an opt-out provision where they fill out a form and send it to the DRA and say hey I'm doing a certain number of returns this year or whatever the situation you know just I want to check a box that I'm going to be sending them in by hand.

421
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And I think, I think the process really could be that simple to address that concern.

422
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
All right.

423
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Thank you.

424
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
A follow-up?

425
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So yeah, I think you understand my concern.

426
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,500
I don't think we want to restrict anybody from performing a service that they have a skill to do.

427
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
And that's my concern.

428
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:29,500
So when we hear from, we're going to be hearing from Ms.

429
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Lear from DRA in a few minutes.

430
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Maybe she can help us out with this.

431
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Thank you.

432
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You're welcome.

433
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,500
Norm, I had to mute you while Patrick was talking, so you need to unmute.

434
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Thank you.

435
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Okay.

436
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,000
Representative Elney has a question.

437
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Thank you, Mr.

438
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Chairman.

439
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm going to have some questions for DRA also, but on two things.

440
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:12,500
One, isn't this going to increase considerably the price of the software for vendors?

441
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:29,000
Because it is going to take quite a lot, as you were saying, for the software companies to set up a proper electronic form for New Hampshire, given the complexity of our software.

442
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And second, do you know of any vendors that we could contact to talk to us about this?

443
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,500
Thank you for your questions, Representative Almey.

444
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:52,000
My response and take is that it really doesn't increase the cost of the software being passed on to the consumers.

445
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Being practitioners, that it's part of what they do, and they have their own fully dedicated departments that are working with all states all the time.

446
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And as Carolyn can testify, the DRA is a whole department that's already dedicated to it.

447
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So in a sense, it's essentially just opening up some tunnels and making sure some approvals get back and forth for it to happen.

448
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So I really do not believe there's any increased cost to consumers.

449
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
As an example, my software is a fixed fee software.

450
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:48,500
So I pay just X amount of dollars per year for the privilege of the federal program in all the states being all e-file everywhere.

451
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:56,500
So I do not believe saying New Hampshire e-filing would increase the cost of any software.

452
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
I truly don't think that will.

453
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I don't.

454
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Hopefully that helps answer that question.

455
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:23,000
And as far as vendor contacts, the DRA already has relationships and contacts with many, many vendors in place already that are currently using, currently making their whatever software they have available for New Hampshire D filing.

456
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:39,500
So I'm sure there's absolutely a way to, well, if the vendors could find the time and be party to a call, I'm sure there would be a way to have them participate.

457
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm just not entirely sure if I could do it, because I don't have those established relationships with all the other vendors, but I know the DRA certainly does.

458
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Thank you.

459
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That's a very good suggestion for how to contact them.

460
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I wasn't worrying so much about the consumer as about the CPA, particularly the ones that are on their own.

461
00:45:11,000 --> 00:46:22,500
yeah and that that really is what i was trying that sort of was what i was trying to relay that the cpa is that there isn't really going to be from the seat i sit in there'll be no increased cost when if my vendor said new hampshire now has a requirement it's just a matter of they already have a fully dedicated department it's a few people on their end working on that tunnel with new hampshire so as a service provider it would not increase the cost for me and i'm really not sure if it would increase the cost all all across the board it's usually a fixed fee you either check a box for state e-filing yes or no and you pay for sort of the whole all the states you don don't pay like by the state.

462
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,000
Some may pay per return.

463
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm not sure.

464
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,500
But some may pay per return e-filing.

465
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:42,000
Usually that's a really minor fee, like a $10 extra fee per e-file to get it through the tunnel electronically to the state.

466
00:46:42,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And it goes to the IRS first, and then it comes back down to the to the state so but there if there's a fee it'd be so in my opinion very very minor but mostly I don't believe there would be a fee.

467
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Representative Janjigian.

468
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Thank you Mr.

469
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Chairman.

470
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Thank you Mr.

471
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Chickering for your testimony.

472
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,500
My question, I'm just an individual who prepares my own taxes using TurboTax.

473
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:28,500
And I noticed I do end up owing a business profits tax and a dividends tax.

474
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:36,000
And when I finish, TurboTax is preparing those state returns, the New Hampshire state returns.

475
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:46,500
But you're right, at the end, I get to a point where it says, print them out and mail them in.

476
00:47:46,500 --> 00:48:01,000
So is the, I just want to understand is the problem that DRA does not accept, you were talking about the vendors, but the vendors already preparing the tax.

477
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Does DRA not accept?

478
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh no, sorry, I mean to interrupt you.

479
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:37,500
The DRA accepts e-files currently for New Hampshire for all returns it's really a per vendor basis whether or not they're they make it available and they've worked with the state with the DRA's e-filing approval system to have it in place so my guess is I don't use TurboTax I'm not too familiar with the nuances of it, Representative Janigian.

480
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,500
But that's not uncommon that you get to that point.

481
00:48:42,500 --> 00:49:00,000
And then you can't really move any further where you sort of just stuck with, okay, I have to print and mail it to get it to where it needs to go at that point.

482
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm answering your question.

483
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Does that address it?

484
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I think you are.

485
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,500
So you're basically saying that DRA is ready to accept that electronic filing.

486
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:24,500
It's just that TurboTax, in this case, hasn't worked with DRA to work on the actual transmission part of it.

487
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
Correct.

488
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
Absolutely.

489
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:35,500
So the DRA has e-filing acceptance capabilities, and they accept many from many vendors.

490
00:49:35,500 --> 00:50:00,500
It's just if you have this word or this type of legislation passed, then the vendors have no choice, but to make that the wall that you hit, basically they have to comply with state law and say, okay, well now we've got to make it available for New Hampshire.

491
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Okay, thank you.

492
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Thank you.

493
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
You're welcome.

494
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Any other hands?

495
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
So, Alan.

496
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
Representative Bernstein.

497
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Thank you, Mr.

498
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Chair.

499
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
And thank you, Mr.

500
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Chickering, for coming and testifying in front of our committee.

501
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:30,500
It sounds to me like the vendor you deal with isn't offering this service.

502
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,500
Why wouldn't you just switch vendors?

503
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:44,000
And if there's enough CPA firms like yours, where there's a void in the marketplace, they just go to another vendor.

504
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I don't understand why the market isn't just taking care of this.

505
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, thank you for your question.

506
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,500
It really is a matter of cost.

507
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:14,000
And if smaller firms such as myself were to switch to a larger vendor, we're talking of incurring costs of anywhere from $5,000 to $8,000 a year just to switch to a higher level vendor.

508
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,500
so i i I, I totally understand your question.

509
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,000
I, I definitely appreciate it.

510
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,500
There's a huge cost to switching vendors.

511
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:30,500
There's also an immensely high learning curve of switching vendors is awesome.

512
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:43,000
Many problems for vendors say, Oh, all your, we'll do a big data conversion to bring all your clients from that software to another software.

513
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's always so messy and such a headache.

514
00:51:47,000 --> 00:52:08,500
I did it once many years ago from one vendor, which was actually part of the Intuit family that representative Janigian is using on TurboTax, a higher level Intuit, which actually they also, I don't believe, offer much for New Hampshire e-filing still.

515
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:18,500
But that really is prohibitive from just randomly, not randomly, but sort of planning to change for that reason alone.

516
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:29,000
um it's just it's a lot to change vendors financially, the time costs, and yeah, it's just, it's a bigger deal.

517
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's a big deal.

518
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Understood.

519
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Thank you.

520
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't see any other hand, so I don't want to ask the next witness, actually a sponsor, Representative Alexander.

521
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Representative Alexander.

522
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,500
I don't see him on.

523
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Okay, then the next is from the DRA, Carolyn Lear.

524
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Hello, Mr.

525
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Chair and members of the committee.

526
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:05,000
Carolyn Lear, Assistant Commissioner at the New Hampshire Department of Revenue.

527
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Mr.

528
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:21,500
Chickering did a lovely job explaining how things work here at the DRA, so I won't repeat anything that he's already explained about how sort of e-filing works currently.

529
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:30,000
I just want to say that the Department of Revenue is very much in favor of e-filing.

530
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
E-filing is good for the department.

531
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:41,000
E-filed returns are certainly easier to process, but we don't take a position on mandated e-filing.

532
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:52,000
We're happy to accept returns and money however they come in, and we just don't take a position on mandating the e-filing.

533
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:03,500
You all received a fiscal note quick guide from us on this bill, which sort of explains our position on the revenue impact.

534
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,000
As you heard from Mr.

535
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,500
Chickering, we have a staff that's responsible for approving vendors to e-file with the department.

536
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:19,000
That staff is currently maybe one, one and a half people.

537
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:46,500
And how that process works is if a vendor wants to e-file New Hampshire returns or to facilitate the e-filing of New Hampshire returns, they have to sort of prove to us that the data is going to come through in an accurate way that's digestible by our computer systems, to put it quite simply.

538
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:57,000
But the work of that group doesn't really stop there because every filing season, there are changes to New Hampshire forms.

539
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:11,500
So it's communicating back and forth with each of the vendors to sort of communicate those changes and make sure that they effectuate those changes on their end properly.

540
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,000
And then every filing season there are always issues.

541
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:29,500
A good example is a couple years ago, one of the larger vendors who files a great proportion of the electronic business tax returns in New Hampshire.

542
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,000
The returns were coming through with the incorrect FEIN.

543
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:45,500
This was an issue with partnerships because in New Hampshire, we require partnerships to use an FEIN, not the social of their members.

544
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,500
So the returns were coming through with the wrong FEIN.

545
00:55:50,500 --> 00:56:02,000
And it was a huge issue for us because we couldn't post the returns to the correct taxpayer account without the correct FEIN.

546
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,500
And we worked quite extensively with the vendor to make sure they fixed that issue.

547
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:17,000
So those are the sorts of things, the work that might increase with increased e-filing.

548
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:26,500
But of course, that work is going to be offset by a loss of manual work, primarily opening mail.

549
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:33,000
That is really the manual part for us of receiving a paper return.

550
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,500
As you heard, opening and unstapling paper returns is a lot of work.

551
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:47,000
The scanning isn't a ton of work because we sort of do those in stacks.

552
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You take the stack of returns, put them on the machine, and they just feed through and scan.

553
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And we don't do a ton of manual data entry because our paper returns are scanned and then we have an optical recognition system that actually pulls the data off the return.

554
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So we're not doing a ton of data entry, but certainly the work of opening all that mail manually would substantially decrease if e-filing were to be mandated and thus our proportion of e-filed returns were to increase.

555
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,500
You have the fiscal note quick guide.

556
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:43,000
I did do a bit of research into other states' statutes, and I did highlight Thank you.

557
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
to increase.

558
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,500
You have the fiscal note quick guide.

559
00:57:48,500 --> 00:58:05,000
I did do a bit of research into other states' statutes and I did highlight a few things that you might want to consider if you were to go forward with this bill.

560
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Otherwise, I'm just happy to answer any of your questions.

561
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Representative Almi has her hand up.

562
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Representative Almi, you have a question.

563
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,500
Oh dear, the phone is ringing in the background, ignore it.

564
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:40,000
I did have the same kinds of questions about this related to the vendors, how hard it's going to be to incorporate this and whether they're going to put the price into what they charge the CPAs.

565
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:48,500
I use a CPA that did not like being in a firm, which she had started actually.

566
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
And she works herself.

567
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:58,500
She just moved to Colorado last year and she's still doing New Hampshire taxes for people.

568
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:07,000
I don't actually know if she does businesses still, but her firm does, the one she started.

569
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:16,000
And she does quite a few tax returns and some pretty complicated ones and does them very well.

570
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And she was deliriously happy when you put IND out as e-filing.

571
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But I do worry about whether there's a real issue in terms of vendors charging more for the entire package, if that's the way it would work, or putting an add-on for New Hampshire and making that an option in other states tax packages.

572
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,500
But I also am worried about the effective date.

573
00:59:48,500 --> 01:00:09,500
I do know it takes quite a long time to process the changes each year and get them ready for the software vendors so that they can get the software to the CPAs so that they can provide next year's tax returns.

574
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:19,000
And I'm not sure whether making it effective in this July works, or is that one of your recommendations?

575
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And I am very sorry that I have not read the quick note yet.

576
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Thank you, Representative, for the question.

577
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I'll just say I'm not concerned about the work required of us to implement more e-filing.

578
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I think, like I said, we get more work in one area, but we lose it in another.

579
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Of course, we don't receive any information about what the vendors are charging for their product.

580
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And so I really couldn't speak to what would happen with prices.

581
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:22,500
I did not include a recommendation in my fiscal note quick hide about the effective date, but I did include a recommendation that perhaps you add or modify sort of the requirement to indicate that it only applies to returns that are available for e-filing.

582
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,000
And I think that might remedy the timing issue a bit.

583
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Because if a vendor hasn't had the time to go through the process yet with the department, then it would not be an issue of the vendor refusing to e-file, but just an issue of them not having made it available yet.

584
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And I think that might remedy that concern.

585
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Because I agree, it will take some time for vendors to establish that relationship with the department and get the returns flowing to us, particularly because they do their work on a tax year.

586
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So if you miss the tax year, it's really going to be working towards the next tax year to get e-filing up and running.

587
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Thank you.

588
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:33,500
Do you think that that's a better way to handle than to simply make it effective a year later?

589
01:02:33,500 --> 01:03:10,000
Because that, what you're talking about, that that's a better way to handle this than to simply make it effective the year a year later because that what you're talking about i think would be putting a temporary exemption in forever that's true i think um one of the other things that i believe you address by saying returns that are available for e-filing is you address the concern about old years, right?

590
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
We accept amended returns.

591
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Pretty much any year you want to file will at least take in the return, even if it's out of statute, and process it.

592
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But vendors are not going to want to go back and make their 2011 return e-fileable.

593
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It just wouldn't be efficient because they might only receive one or two amended returns for those old years ever.

594
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So that's another concern that the recommendation addresses.

595
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Thank you.

596
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Okay, Representative Ainge, do you have a question?

597
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Okay, I'm unmuted.

598
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Yeah, I wonder if you could give us a sense, maybe there have to be categories of the volume we're talking about.

599
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,500
What proportion of returns are now e-filed?

600
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:43,000
And looking forward, if this mandate applied to those that are filing more than, what is it, 25, what would be the change in that volume can you give us a sense of that or are we talking about big complex returns mostly or is it a full range of returns that would have to be you filed now or there would be e-filed you for the question, Representative.

601
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,500
I did pull some stats from fiscal year 20.

602
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Meals and rentals, I pulled meals and rentals, IND, and business returns.

603
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:03,000
For meals and rentals, we receive about 30,000 returns a year, or received 30,000 returns in that fiscal year.

604
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And 91% of those returns were electronically filed.

605
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I think the reason you see that is because in order to get the 3% commission under the M&R tax, operators have to e-file.

606
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:28,500
For interest in dividends tax, it's 66,000 returns and about 71% were e-filed and 29% were filed in paper.

607
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:33,500
I think interest in dividends tax returns are relatively easy.

608
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:41,000
You know, there are one or two pages, not a lot of information on them.

609
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So I think vendors have been particularly willing to do those returns for New Hampshire to e-file them.

610
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:59,500
I'm not sure I can answer the question for you about whether e-filing would increase the IND e-filing percentage.

611
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,500
I'm not sure why that 29% isn't e-filing.

612
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:13,500
For business taxes, for fiscal year 20, we had about 77,000 returns, and it was almost 50-50 paper and e-file.

613
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:23,500
And so I really think that business taxes is the place where you would see the largest swing in e-filing.

614
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:31,500
Because one, there's the most sort of ground to cover there with only 50% being e-filed.

615
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:52,500
And I can only speak anecdotally about why it's so low with business taxes, but I do think at least anecdotally, it does relate to sort of the uniqueness and complexity of the New Hampshire return and why those are getting mailed.

616
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
Thank you.

617
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
All right.

618
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,500
Mr.

619
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:01,500
Chik, do you want to comment?

620
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
Well, thank you.

621
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,500
I just wanted to respond briefly.

622
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:21,500
I know representative Almey has some concerns and Representative Ames, but I just wanted to mention that or just share my experiences with pricing and the cost associated with it.

623
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,000
And I'm happy to speak offline anytime.

624
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:37,500
So you guys are welcome to reach out to me if you have more concerns and you need more explanations or anything I can offer.

625
01:07:37,500 --> 01:08:06,500
But as e-file has evolved over the years and more and more states either required it or became available because of the ease of their laws and piggybacking off federal returns, I've never seen my vendor or any vendor say, oh, well now, now that Vermont is offering e-filing, we're increasing our fees by X amount of dollars.

626
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,000
I just have not seen that in my experience.

627
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,500
Usually it's just the federal package and then the state package.

628
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,500
So I wanted to share that.

629
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:32,500
It hasn't been my experience that it'll be an increase in cost if this bill were to say New Hampshire is going to be requiring e-filing.

630
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:56,500
And my guess is if this legislation were to pass, it would have an effective date for years beginning on or after a certain date, which would most likely be the next calendar year or however the process works in legislation, which I'm not quite as familiar with.

631
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:15,000
So I don't think it would be anything that were a bomb is dropped on all these practitioners all of a sudden, and they're sort of left out in the cold and not knowing what to do.

632
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So I wanted to share that.

633
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:28,500
And Representative Ames, I know the I think the word mandate can be very scary in a sense versus saying requiring.

634
01:09:28,500 --> 01:10:24,000
But I do think it's important for us to consider an opt out if you don't have the technological capabilities and or if you just don't want to e-file same thing with IRS rules IRS rules if you can't file return by paper you can opt out so I don't see why we can't add that to this bill that pretty much there's a requirement to do it we're requiring requiring to do at least 25, but even if you're doing more than 25 and you're having and you do have some concerns about being able to effectively e-file, then there should be a check the box form that's easily approved.

635
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So thank you.

636
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I just wanted to add address those concerns.

637
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Okay.

638
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Okay.

639
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Representative Elliott, you have a question?

640
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Yes.

641
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It's for Mr.

642
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Chickeree.

643
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Can you hear me?

644
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Yes, sir.

645
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,500
But he answered the question.

646
01:10:49,500 --> 01:11:08,000
But the question was going to be, don't you believe, as I do, that one of the drawbacks of this bill is that the increased costs, whatever they are, will definitely be passed on to the consumer.

647
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:15,500
Now your answer to the question is, no, you don't think that's going to happen.

648
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:26,500
But if I were a gambling man, I'll bet you 100 bucks bucks to a dollar that it is going to happen.

649
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Thank you for answering my question.

650
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
You're welcome.

651
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,000
I would actually look at it the other way.

652
01:11:36,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It costs me and my firm more time to physically print the return, to put sign here stickers on it to pay postageage, to mail to the client, for them to spend time to sign and mail and write a checkout versus if e-filing capabilities were in place, the process and time spent is much faster.

653
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,500
So I do not believe there would be additional costs that would be passed on.

654
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,500
At least in my firm, there wouldn't be.

655
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:25,500
I don't know if anyone else would justify that as a reason for doing so, but I don't see it.

656
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:32,000
I think it takes more time and cost to do it by hand.

657
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'm sorry that we disagree strongly.

658
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Representative John Jigdon.

659
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Thank you, Mr.

660
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Chairman.

661
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
This question is for Carolyn Lear.

662
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:53,500
I was wondering, can we get a list of the vendors, the tax vendors who you're currently working with?

663
01:12:53,500 --> 01:13:06,500
And I wonder whether listing, and maybe you already have this on the state website, a list of those vendors that you do work electronically with.

664
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Because not only would it be informative, but it might actually cause other vendors to say, hey, maybe we should work electronically.

665
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:26,500
Because I'll tell you, I find it annoying when I get to that point with TurboTax, for instance.

666
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:44,500
And again, I'm just an individual filing my own stuff that I now have to print it out and send it in when all I could have done is just click the button and been done.

667
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,500
So I guess, do you list the vendors?

668
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:57,000
And if not, could you list the vendors on the state website that you currently work with?

669
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Thank you for the question, Representative.

670
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:09,500
Yes, we do list the vendors that are currently approved and working with us for e-file on our website.

671
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:17,500
I will send the link to Jennifer and ask that she circulate it to the committee.

672
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:24,000
But yes, it's posted on our website, primarily so that folks can know.

673
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We think of it more as a compliance tool so that if you're curious, if your vendor is legitimately working with this state, you could identify that on the website.

674
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:49,500
We think of it less as a sort of consumer, I guess, push tool as more of an ability to check.

675
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
Thank you.

676
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Representative Urali.

677
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
There it goes.

678
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,500
Thank you, Mr.

679
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,500
Chair.

680
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:10,000
I actually contacted my accountant regarding this and their comment was there's only two things that they have to file up.

681
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,500
One would be for our dupe-eyed paper.

682
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:21,000
One is the low-income tax rebate, and the other one is the business profits tax.

683
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Everything else they do for either mass or the federal government is done electronically.

684
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,500
I ask them what the cost would be if they went all electronic.

685
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,000
There would be no increase.

686
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It would most likely be a decrease in cost because they don't have to do any more work.

687
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,500
They type it on the computer, they push a button, and it's gone.

688
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
It's gone.

689
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Okay, was that a question or a statement?

690
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,500
That was a question.

691
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,500
Would you believe?

692
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,500
Thank you.

693
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,500
Who wants to respond to that?

694
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:10,500
Seeing none, Representative for both Mr.

695
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,500
Chickering and Ms.

696
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,500
Lear.

697
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:33,500
If I'm understanding this correctly, the purpose or motive of the requested legislation is to put leverage on a certain group of vendors, I don't know if they're a minority or majority, to move into the current world.

698
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:46,000
But the current status as I am getting it is that DRA does accept e-filing, encourages e-filing, but they're taking no position on mandating e-filing.

699
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:55,000
And I just wonder whether the problem is not as large as the bill makes it look like.

700
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:03,000
So, for example, nothing in this bill defines tax returns, which tax returns we're focusing on.

701
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,500
I know we're amending 21J13D.

702
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:14,000
I haven't looked at that, so I don't know whether it's more limited in prior statutory language.

703
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But should this be more narrowly focused to address to the very specific problem that Mr.

704
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,500
Chickering has identified, which seems to be the BPT-BET?

705
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Anybody want to respond to that?

706
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Mr.

707
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:36,500
Chair, this is Carolyn Lear from the Department of Revenue.

708
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:42,000
I think you've accurately described the department's position on the legislation.

709
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,500
I do agree with you.

710
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:52,500
And if you have the fiscal note quick guide in front of you, there's a comment.

711
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:59,000
I believe this statute or the bill uses the phrase authorized tax document.

712
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:14,500
And I do think that could use a definition, but I won't speak to whether or not the bill's sponsor could still achieve their goal with limiting it to business taxes.

713
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,000
I think either the sponsor or Mr.

714
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,500
Chickering could speak to that.

715
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,500
Okay.

716
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Mr.

717
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,500
Chickering, did you want to respond?

718
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,500
Sure.

719
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,500
Yeah.

720
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,500
Representative Spilsbury, hopefully this helps address or answer some questions.

721
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:49,000
So as far as saying a business profits tax return and a business enterprise tax return, Carolyn can also help me explain this as well.

722
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:58,000
As far as business profits tax returns, there's essentially five different ones for each type of business entity.

723
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:10,000
if you're a sole proprietor, there's what's called an NH-1040 business profits tax return that has different rules and other business profits tax returns.

724
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:24,500
If you're a single member LLC, that's a multi-member LLC, you default to be a partnership, then you file a form NH-1065, which is a business profits tax return.

725
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:35,500
So it goes down the line, there's an NH-1120 business, so there's all different types of business profits returns that get prepared.

726
01:19:35,500 --> 01:20:09,000
Similarly, for the BET, there's a few different types, but Carolyn could probably help me with that as well but there's there's many returns that all have a little bit different nuances and all have to have different types of tax treatments as they go through the process so it's i don't know if i'm answering your question but it's not just sort of simply of returns.

727
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:20,500
There's many, many different and they all flow into the business tax summary return when they get submitted to the Department of Revenue.

728
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:26,000
And I don't know if that answers your question, Representative Spilsbury.

729
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:38,500
I think it answers in part from one direction, which is to say there's a multitude of different forms and returns relating to business tax.

730
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:53,000
But it doesn't answer the question from the other perspective, which is using a broad term like one authorized tax document sweeps in how many other kinds of returns.

731
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Understood.

732
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Understood.

733
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Yeah, when I initially had worked on, worked with Representative Gunstey on this legislation, I had spelled out all the types of returns that it does, that it would address, business profits, taxes for, you know, partnerships, for sole proprietorships, for corporations.

734
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:36,500
So they were spelled out and they can be spelled out or the term tax returns covers them in a sense with a broad brush, but certainly that's something that can be worked on and defined better.

735
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:41,000
So that would, hopefully that helps answer the question.

736
01:21:41,000 --> 01:22:38,500
So, and I did want to mention representative Eulery, your comment on you would talk to your accounting firm and it sounded to me, they had said there would really be no cost involved on their end that they would pass on to consumers that it's just a matter of increasing efficiencies like i'll i'll do 100 100 something new hampshire returns every year and the process just stops where you're sort of so efficient with all the other states and then your own home state becomes a project to get the returns completed As I keep keep reiterating the whole process to get a paper file return done and processed can be a nightmare.

737
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
So thank you.

738
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:45,000
Can I just quickly follow up to ask Ms.

739
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Lear to also address my question.

740
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Carolyn.

741
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:01,500
Just to make sure I understand, your question is whether the, as worded, the statute scoops in a lot more than the target.

742
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Whether we need a limiting definition for the terms, tax returns, or one authorized tax document?

743
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,500
I think the answer is yes, for sure.

744
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:20,500
I would encourage you to take a look at the fiscal note quick guide.

745
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:35,500
I think one of our concerns is making sure that the only requirement is on forms that are capable of being e-filed, meaning forms that we accept via e-file currently.

746
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:42,000
Because, for example, I think as drafted, this would capture the railroad tax.

747
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:50,500
And the railroad tax is a very small tax that, you know, a handful of railroads pay.

748
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:54,000
And we don't accept those e-filed currently.

749
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:08,500
We will accept them via e-file when we roll out the next portion of our new Granite Tax Connect online web portal, but currently we don't accept those electronically.

750
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:19,000
So we want to make sure that you're not mandating that folks file something electronically that we can't yet accept electronically.

751
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:28,000
So I think there are examples where this is probably scooping in other tax types unintentionally, for sure.

752
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I'll defer to, again, to this bill sponsor as to what the intended target was but I think it likely wasn't examples like the railroad tax thank you that gets directly to my question I appreciate it okay represent thank you mr.

753
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
chairman on I.

754
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,500
I think this is mostly to Ms.

755
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
Lear.

756
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:11,000
The interest in dividends tax is frequently prepared still by the person, the individual that's paying it because it's just, it comes pretty much straight from your federal return.

757
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Or it is prepared in a lot of cases, and I believe Granite United Way helps set these up in some places.

758
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,500
Ours are done through our senior centers.

759
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:42,000
Individuals who are volunteers get a short course in how to fill these things out, and they are brought to the senior center every year, and the people wait while it gets done.

760
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,500
This year it's going to be done in a parking lot.

761
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
But these are volunteers.

762
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:55,000
They aren't really trained tax people, except very briefly, I think.

763
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:11,500
And they must also, it had never occurred to me that they must be doing the low and median moderate income property tax relief forms, which when that was started, were extremely complex.

764
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,000
I hope they've been simplified.

765
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:21,000
But it was the town clerks who had to help people fill them out.

766
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,500
And so a lot of them didn't even get filled out.

767
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:39,500
And that is also something that someone who is eligible for low and moderate income property tax relief is usually not going to have an accountant.

768
01:26:39,500 --> 01:27:00,000
So I wanted to ask on if you thought there's that one, there's the railroad tax, there's a whole other of these, whether we ought to just specify the business taxes as possibly being something that this would be done with.

769
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:07,500
And anybody paying the business taxes may well be paying the interest and dividends tax.

770
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:12,000
They would automatically, I think, he filed that one.

771
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:20,500
And we also, we already solved the rooms and meals when we put in the 3% rebate.

772
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
Let her answer that.

773
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
Mrs.

774
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,500
Carolyn?

775
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,500
Thank you, Representative Almi.

776
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:48,500
I don't know the answer to whether or not the VITA clinics, whether they're currently, the VITA clinics and also I think AARP does some free tax prep clinics for both the IND tax and the low and moderate program.

777
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,500
And I apologize.

778
01:27:50,500 --> 01:28:03,500
I don't know off the top of my head whether they are e-filing those returns or whether they're printing them and sending them with the constituent.

779
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:16,000
However, I think there may be some space within the statute to maybe sort of carve out an exemption there if you were so inclined.

780
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And as far as limiting this to just the business taxes, I mean, I think you certainly could do that.

781
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:48,500
We don't take a position on whether mandated e-filing is a good or bad thing, so I won't advise you to whether that is a good or bad idea, but I think that would certainly be a way to target this a little more narrowly.

782
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Okay, I'm going to limit this now to Representative Gonski.

783
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Representative Gonski?

784
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:05,500
uh gunski you want to unmute yes good morning sorry my audio was cutting out i could you repeat that?

785
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,500
Hello?

786
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,500
Yes.

787
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:13,500
I'm recognizing you, you had your hand raised.

788
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Okay, yes.

789
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Thank you.

790
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Sorry about that.

791
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:24,000
The audio is in and out on my computer.

792
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,500
I'm not sure if I have some internet issues.

793
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,500
I am sending my testimony into the committee.

794
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:50,000
And the testimony I've highlighted actual the actual returns and that information was provided to OLS when this was drawn up it just wasn't actually included so it specifies exactly the returns that that Mr.

795
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Chickering was was addressing.

796
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,500
okay and we will be having a work session on bills next week.

797
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,500
And this bill will be included in that.

798
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:05,000
Thank you very much, Mr.

799
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Chair.

800
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
All right.

801
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Mr.

802
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Chickering, you have one final comment?

803
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Yes.

804
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I just want to assess, help Representative Almi with her concern regarding preparers like volunteers who may be helping people.

805
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:36,000
there's a definition or there will be a definition, if this is as introduced, that defines a tax return preparer.

806
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:45,000
It says means a person repairs any New Hampshire state tax return or claim for refund for compensation.

807
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So these are VITA people helping at a retirement home, helping people file interest in dividends tax return.

808
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,500
It does not apply to them because they're not doing it for compensation.

809
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,500
Okay.

810
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,500
I don't see any more hands.

811
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,500
I have a question.

812
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
Oh, represent Tucker.

813
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,500
Yes, I wanted to ask Ms.

814
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:26,500
Lear what the effect would be if this were delayed for a year while all these different facets were looked into and possible amendments made and so forth.

815
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:31,000
Is there any particular rush to get this through?

816
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:41,500
So like I testified to, the department doesn't really take a position on whether we need to mandate e-file or not.

817
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:48,000
So similarly, we wouldn't take a position on delaying it a year either.

818
01:31:48,000 --> 01:32:00,000
From our perspective, we are happy to continue to accept paper returns for so long as the legislature would like us to do that.

819
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Thank you.

820
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Okay.

821
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Hold on one second.

822
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I don't see any more hands.

823
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,500
Okay, hold on one second.

824
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
One second.

825
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:20,000
Major, there is a, Kevin Kennedy as an attendee has his hand up.

826
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Okay.

827
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Before I do that, let me just finish reading the blue sheet.

828
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:41,500
The blue sheet has aaf has an Eric representing himself from the public who opposes this and Representative Alexander who is a co-sponsor and he said Mr.

829
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Ho.

830
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,500
Kevin Kennedy again, and I've just unmuted him.

831
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,000
If you'd like to say.

832
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Mr.

833
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Kennedy.

834
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Thank you very much.

835
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,500
As I mentioned before, I'm a CPA here in New Hampshire.

836
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:12,000
I'm also on the Board of Trustees for the Hampshire Society of CPAs, and I'm-chair of the Tax and Legislation Committee.

837
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:24,500
Generally speaking, with the conversations I've had with my peers in these committees, we're not taking a position in favor or against this particular bill.

838
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:35,500
Certainly, I think we all understand the pros and cons associated with having electronic filing and the efficiency that comes with that.

839
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:40,500
A couple of items to note relative to this bill.

840
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:47,000
This bill is, of course, for tax practitioners or people who receive compensation.

841
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So individuals who are doing their own returns on TurboTax, this wouldn't apply to them as far as I understand the bill.

842
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:19,500
So as an item of clarity, I think that's important to note that this doesn't mandate software companies requiring them to have e-file availability for anybody who uses their software, only that practitioners who do 25 or more have to use electronic filing.

843
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Relative to the opt-out options that were discussed, I think perhaps in terms of opt-out, having a practitioner opt-out, if that ability is there, I'm not sure if that might defeat the purpose of the bill.

844
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:47,000
Again, not that we're opposed or against, but if the software company simply goes, well, you can opt out.

845
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So we're not going to, we're not going to put New Hampshire electronic filing in our software, then that might defeat it.

846
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:13,500
I think a better word for practitioners would be filing for an exemption, which basically means they can submit to the DRA why doing electronic filing in their situation is problematic.

847
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:24,500
I know this puts more burden on the DRA, but perhaps that would be a compromise relative to providing practitioners some ability.

848
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:38,000
As the comments to me from the people in the society and the committee, one of the concerns was having the taxpayer the ability to opt out.

849
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:48,500
Several states have a form that allow the taxpayer to sign and tell the practitioner, I don't want to electronically file.

850
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:56,000
And as such, here's a document releasing you of the responsibility to file my return.

851
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And I think that's a very, if this bill is put into place, that would be a very important piece of it.

852
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:17,500
If not specifically stated, then somehow guidance relative to when the DRA comes out with the rules associated with this bill.

853
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:22,500
A lot of older taxpayers are concerned about electronic filing.

854
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:31,000
They like that paper copy, you know, mailing it in, getting a check mailed back to them.

855
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And this word mandate can be a little bit spooky for folks.

856
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:47,500
And the other provision I think that we would like is some concern about relief from penalties associated with not filing.

857
01:36:47,500 --> 01:37:03,000
I certainly had situations where I've tried to file things like a federal return, and there have been glitches along the way, and the return simply had to be manually filed.

858
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So some sort of relief, and again, whether or not this is simply guidance in the bill or specifically stated relief that practitioners can be provided penalty for relief for reasonable cause.

859
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And maybe that's because there was a medical condition, maybe COVID, maybe technical glitches, maybe because their software, it's a little tricky because we're trying to get the software vendors in place here, but maybe they simply, their software vendor simply hasn't been able to get their software in place for it.

860
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,000
But some relief for practitioners so that they aren't necessarily unduly hit with penalties.

861
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,500
And I think that's it.

862
01:37:54,500 --> 01:38:09,500
We also, I think we also support what the DRA's comments were about making sure that it only mandates returns that the DRA is actually set up to accept electronically.

863
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:13,000
And I believe that's all my comments.

864
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Thank you very much.

865
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Thank you, Mr.

866
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Kennedy.

867
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Anybody else wants to testify for or against hospital 528?

868
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I don't see any.

869
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
So I'm going to close the public hearing on house bill 528.

870
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Thank you.

871
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Close the public hearing on House Bill 528.

872
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Okay, we're going to do a test to see if our system is up.

873
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
So what do you want us to do?

874
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
So I'm going to mute your computers and turn your speakers on.

875
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,500
I'll just put the volume all the way down.

876
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:04,000
your computers and turn your speakers on Thank you.

877
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Gracias.

878
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Thank you.

879
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
you want to all right Mr.

880
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,500
Chairman It's going to be a test in one, two, Mr.

881
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,500
Chairman, you want to?

882
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:20,500
Testing, one, two, three.

883
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,500
Testing, one, two, three.

884
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,500
E aí Thank you.

885
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,500
Okay.

886
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:30,500
We're going to start with the next hearing.

887
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:36,500
I'm opening here on House Bill 134, repealing certain inactive dedicated funds.

888
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:40,000
And the prime sponsor is Representative Major.

889
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Representative Major.

890
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Thank you, Mr.

891
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Chairman.

892
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:55,000
This bill is a result of a joint committee that's been in existence for a number of years.

893
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,500
And they do a five year rotation.

894
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:07,500
One year they'll look at about a half a dozen agencies, all the dedicated funds associated with that.

895
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:11,500
Next year they'll do five other different agencies.

896
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:23,000
And every year the joint on Dedicated Fund looks at and tries to identify those funds that are inactive or no longer needed.

897
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And we start off the year by asking the Administrative Services to give us a list of all the dedicated funds that have no, that have no, had no activity.

898
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And then we'll bring in the agencies and ask them, since there's been no activities, are these dedicated funds mated and why?

899
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
That's one area we look at.

900
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Then we looked at all the dedicated funds on a group of, say, five agencies, and we review them with the agencies to see if any of these can be removed or any of them could be modified.

901
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,500
And we have over a couple hundred dedicated funds.

902
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:30,000
Over the last few years, we've eliminated probably close to a hundred dedicated funds are no longer necessary and they no longer have to be carried on the books.

903
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:47,000
This legislation is the result of what we did this past year and Representative Almi is going to verify that we have the dedicated funds that we agreed on as part of this legislation.

904
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:56,500
This legislation also covers two years because last year's bill as a result of a pandemic didn't get done.

905
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:01,500
It was essentially tabled because it wasn't considered that important.

906
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:08,000
So now we're dealing with this two years worth of joint committee study.

907
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:26,500
To look at the bill, line on the first page, line one through seven eliminates four dedicated funds from the post-secondary education commission storage after we did all the interrogation and mutually agreed it's not needed anymore.

908
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:37,000
But in section 2, line 8 through 11, we find out that there's a couple funds that should have been listed.

909
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:51,000
So lines 8 through 11 puts these two funds into a dedicated fund, money deposit and forest improvement fund, and money deposit and forest protection personal training fund.

910
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,500
To categorize these as dedicated funds to be reviewed on a five-year cycle.

911
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:00,000
Section three was primarily cleanup.

912
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,500
Some of these dedicated funds needed the legislative language Thank you.

913
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,000
Section 3 was primarily cleanup.

914
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:19,500
Some of these dedicated funds needed the legislative language to go along with them, so the intent of the dedicated funds is represented.

915
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,500
Section 3 does that.

916
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:32,500
Section 5, which starts on line 20, is also a clean up in legislation that's required to go on those dedicated funds.

917
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:40,500
Section 6 is the balance of public interest payment fund lapsed to the Public Utility Commission.

918
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:45,500
Section 7 repeals two funds on the meat inspection fund.

919
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:53,500
Section 8 clarify the reference to the fund is removed and it cleans up the legislation.

920
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:58,000
Section 9 is the John Winnett Memorial Special Account.

921
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,500
Essentially, it has been agreed that it is no longer required.

922
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:19,000
Section 10 reveals the Office of Professional Licenses for certain licenses relative to 612-JVD8 relative to the year 4 reporting requirements for the Office of professional licenses and certification that's revealed.

923
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:25,500
Section 11 starting on line 34 also applies the office of professional licenses.

924
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:33,000
And And we had to amend that so the intent of this fund was qualified.

925
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Representative Alney will follow me and further explain.

926
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
explain.

927
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Senator Geider who was on this?

928
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,500
Senator Geider was a member of the Dedicated Fund.

929
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,500
So there's a committee.

930
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,500
Who was made up the committee?

931
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,500
Right.

932
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:56,000
Who made up the committee?

933
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,500
I was Representative Alney, myself.

934
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:03,000
Representative Ober was either a member or an alternate.

935
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And there was another alternate from the House, Senator Gray, Senator Geider, Senator, I think her what was the third senator that made up that committee.

936
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Okay.

937
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Okay.

938
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Questions?

939
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I have a question.

940
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Representative, Major, Representative Maynes.

941
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Your hands.

942
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yeah.

943
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,500
By the way, Representative Ames, it's very hard to hear you.

944
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:49,500
So my question is simply, can you tell us, or maybe Representative Ames will be doing this, what money is involved in these funds and where it's going.

945
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:59,000
For example, the legislation says that the, provides that the payphone fund will lapse to the Public Utilities Commission.

946
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So apparently there's some money there.

947
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,500
And what kind of money are we talking about?

948
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:37,500
And then there are a couple of funds that are just repealed i don't see anything about what happens to the money and maybe there's no money but can you sort of speak to this question of the realities of the situation when we abolish a dedicated fund and there's funds in it usually it goes and lapses into the general fund.

949
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
Less specified.

950
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:48,000
There are times that there may be two different dedicated funds, they do almost the same thing.

951
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:54,500
And we'll abolish one and move the funds into the other dedicated fund.

952
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,500
It depends on what it is.

953
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:06,500
A number of times there have been no funds, and it's just been sitting there on the books.

954
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Representative Ames, you all said it?

955
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:17,500
Well, I just was trying to get a sense of magnitude, and I didn't get that.

956
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Representative Almey.

957
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,000
I haven't recognized her yet.

958
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
The questions, are you all set, Representative Vames?

959
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,500
Yes, I am, thank you.

960
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,000
Okay, Representative Vames, you're recognized.

961
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Thank you.

962
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:39,500
These get pretty complex and I was trying to find the PUC report.

963
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:48,000
But I wanted first to point out this thing is the, what I call a telephone book.

964
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It is all the dedicated funds accounting for the state.

965
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:12,000
We've been doing it now for a number of years, but nobody was reading it, so particularly the committees that should be in charge of these funds, and so we decided that we would set up this committee.

966
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:23,500
Representative Walner was also on it, and to my surprise, she showed up quite a lot because she was learning things from finance.

967
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:31,000
She was learning things about the dedicated funds that they hadn't bothered to look at.

968
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:54,500
So, now I'm in representative Major has explained a lot of this, but in 2019, we deleted three funds that are no longer useful and adjusted their language where necessary, because sometimes they're related to legislative language elsewhere, but that language refers back to the dedicated funds.

969
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,500
So if we repeal it, there's a problem.

970
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:20,500
That was true in particular for the one of these, sorry, I'm dealing with two years versions of the bill plus it was true in particular for the public interest pay fund the It was true in particular for the public interest pay fund.

971
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:26,500
The public interest pay fund had, I think, about $20,000 in it.

972
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:35,500
And since it was under the PUC, we defaulted it to the PUC, relapsed it to the PUC.

973
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Most of them had absolutely nothing in them.

974
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:47,500
It had been transferred to another fund already and it was just sitting there complicating things.

975
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:52,000
The meat inspection program Fund was one of those.

976
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
It was repealed.

977
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And the John G.

978
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Winant fund had, I think, a very small amount of money left in it.

979
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,500
It was lapsed to the general fund.

980
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:31,500
that built that, oh no, yes, it was built, it built that lovely statue that is in front of the State Library now of John Winant, who was governor long ago and became very important nationally when he served very capably as an ambassador during World War II in Britain.

981
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:42,000
That one, we had to revise Ola language so that there would be no more building considered, but we did O.

982
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:59,500
So we've left the commission, but not the money in existence so that if sometime in the future they need to acquire more money from contributions and fix the statute, that it could be done.

983
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:05,500
This was the prime author of the original bill was Representative Shurtleff.

984
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:10,000
And I got the language from him for this.

985
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:21,500
on with the animal abuse and treatment fund had been set up on the Animal Abuse and Treatment Fund had been set up.

986
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Oh, no, sorry.

987
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:27,500
Alcohol Abuse and Prevention Treatment Fund, Section 3.

988
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:43,000
On that, the money from that in the budget was taken away to be used for the Medicaid Enhancement Program, which Granite State Health Protection Program, I think it's called now.

989
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,500
But nothing was done to the language for the fund itself.

990
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:52,500
and there was the statutory reference was wrong.

991
01:51:52,500 --> 01:52:06,000
And it didn't allow for the fact that the fund money was replaced in the budget by a two-year payment to the alcohol fund to continue operating.

992
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,500
And it was replaced in the statute, sending it to HHS for the Medicaid prevention.

993
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:19,000
And the idea was this was supposed to be two years.

994
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:25,000
So we adjusted the language back so that it does do that.

995
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:38,000
But then there is still a special language for those two years of the current budget sending the actual money over to the Medicaid Enhancement Program.

996
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:49,500
And the public interest pay funds was set up was set up by a representative who is not with us, I believe, anymore.

997
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:55,500
Because there were orphaned phones sitting in different parts of the state.

998
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:58,500
He had one in his district.

999
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:03,500
It's the only one that actually came into the program.

1000
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:14,000
And the PUC, the utilities that dealt with telephone service were having to pay into this fund, not very much money.

1001
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
It only amounted to about $20,000.

1002
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,500
And the fund was not being used.

1003
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:26,000
We couldn't even find out whether that particular fund still existed.

1004
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:35,500
So we eliminated the program, and we lapsed that money to the PUC, which was in charge of it.

1005
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:43,500
And I think there was a complicated issue with the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification.

1006
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:55,500
we discovered that it had been set up and that it had removed all the fees to control by the head of the office.

1007
01:53:55,500 --> 01:54:03,000
And that we ought to stick it in as part of this program of review.

1008
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
And we set it up for review for last year.

1009
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:20,500
The program has had three different, it was started three years ago now, two and a half, and it has had three heads since then.

1010
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:23,500
They kept on retiring or quitting.

1011
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:27,500
And it now has an extremely capable head.

1012
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:43,500
But at the time that they came in, they came in and they told us, look, we realize now that we are in chaos and we just asked for a performance audit.

1013
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:55,000
And we last year added to that performance audit a financial audit, which LBAO said they could do easily at the same time.

1014
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,500
That is coming out very shortly now.

1015
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:06,500
But they said, will you please do us next year when we're more capable of responding?

1016
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,000
And we agreed to that.

1017
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:21,000
So this language, it repeals what we put into the statute, putting them in in year four, and it moves them to year five.

1018
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
That's all it does.

1019
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,500
And they will be in the fifth year of the cycle.

1020
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:33,000
so they will be coming in at that point.

1021
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I think they're going to be a lot more organized than they are now.

1022
01:55:40,000 --> 01:56:05,000
There's a bill over in the Senate to send to us that will be dealing with the language for the fees that this new director had developed, which ended up on the cutting room floor partly because of us last time because we had no idea what it was about.

1023
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,500
So that's, I think, just about everything in there.

1024
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:13,500
If anybody has any specific questions, I can...

1025
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:17,000
Representative South Park, you're right, very nice.

1026
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Am I unmuted?

1027
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Yes, sir.

1028
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Okay, thank you.

1029
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,500
Thank you for taking my question, really a comment.

1030
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:46,500
I just wanted to appreciate Chairman Major and Representative Almi for their dedication, reviewing the dedicated funds, because I think their diligence, their long-term commitment, This is something important that they've really stuck with for a long time.

1031
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,500
So I just wanted that noted.

1032
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,500
Thank you.

1033
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,500
David Daley- Thanks chairman.

1034
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:57,500
David Daley- Dedicated fun issue as a nightmare.

1035
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:05,000
as was represented Almy showed you a huge book, hundreds of pages of dedicated funds.

1036
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,500
They hadn't been looked at.

1037
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:16,000
We set up a process for over a five year period and we review all of them.

1038
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:27,500
And then we've been able to reduce the size of the book by getting rid of dedicated funds that are no longer necessary.

1039
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:35,500
But when we look at them, we find the legislation to back this up is wrong.

1040
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:38,000
It's got to be fixed.

1041
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And a whole bunch of them.

1042
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,500
That's why I call it a nightmare.

1043
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:52,500
If you love to handle nightmares, volunteer to be on the Joint Committee of Dedicated Friends.

1044
01:57:52,500 --> 01:57:56,000
Representative Major, this Joint Committee continues, right?

1045
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Yes.

1046
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Have appointments been made yet for this term?

1047
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Letters just came out.

1048
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,500
They just came out, okay.

1049
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:10,500
And will it be delayed until it's bandwidth?

1050
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:15,000
Until there is, because right now it's only five.

1051
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
What do you anticipate?

1052
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,500
That it will start in the summer?

1053
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,500
I have no idea.

1054
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:35,000
We may say go to the Department of Safety or Highway or some other who has a zone and ask if you can use this.

1055
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Thank you.

1056
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:43,000
But we have to have something that the public has access to.

1057
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Okay.

1058
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Thank you.

1059
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Representative Amami?

1060
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Thank you.

1061
01:58:51,000 --> 01:59:20,500
The setup that we developed was that in August, all of the departments that are up for review and several that promised to get back to us about things that education and health and human services last time had a lot of loose ends attached to them that we don't have answers for back yet because of the COVID.

1062
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:30,500
But they have to get everything by mid August to the comptroller's office, which is the one that's overseeing this.

1063
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:37,500
And then we, on Representative Major, will set up dates for us to meet.

1064
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:46,000
And if we're really lucky, maybe we can meet in person by that time and maybe not.

1065
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:52,500
But we did meet virtually last time and it didn't work too badly.

1066
01:59:52,500 --> 02:00:11,500
So the other thing is that sometime in the next couple of months, Representative Major is going to have to talk to the comptroller's office about getting after all of those agencies and reminding them that they're due.

1067
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:14,000
They're getting used to it.

1068
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
It's getting easier for us to work because of that.

1069
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I did want to mention that the book is up on the CAFR website, the one that has the monthly revenue focus and the CAFR for the DAS.

1070
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:45,500
And it's somewhat easier to search that than it is to get a copy of the book that they don't make too many copies of.

1071
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:59,500
But you have to be a little creative in looking at the names of the dedicated funds, because sometimes they're referred to differently in one place than another.

1072
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:07,500
And we will have bills, especially second committee bills, that have dedicated fund effects in them.

1073
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:18,500
And it's really helpful to look up the accounting for those and the explanation that is in before we do the hearing.

1074
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:22,500
And the explanations from the last two years.

1075
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:34,500
It took us a while to learn how to do this, but the explanations from the last two years, I think are pretty good.

1076
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:46,000
But we ran into a number of agencies that just didn't have proper explanations and we've been cleaning it up as we go.

1077
02:01:46,000 --> 02:02:05,000
thank you jenny is there anyone else out there no actually there's no attendees right now there's no attendees okay okay okay with that eric Eric Rathborn, signed up on the school, and Thindra Guida is in support.

1078
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
That's what we have.

1079
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So without any other questions from the committee, I'm going to adjourn the meeting on House Bill 134.

1080
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:22,500
you know, this sound quality is just like this morning, all that echoing.

1081
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:25,000
Can you tell from there?

1082
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Yeah, I heard it.

1083
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I heard it.

1084
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Oh, okay.

1085
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,500
Just wanted to make sure.

1086
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:35,500
Thank you.

1087
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:38,500
I'm turning the chair back over.

1088
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:41,500
This has been quite a morning.

1089
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:48,500
I was hoping that we would have had time to exec a few bills.

1090
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,500
We got 25 minutes.

1091
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:53,500
We're done with the morning bills.

1092
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:55,500
Right.

1093
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:59,500
The next public hearing starts at one o'clock.

1094
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:02,500
So we could exec some bills.

1095
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:04,500
So hold on.

1096
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:18,500
I was in Almey has had her caucus review the bills that we heard on the 28th of January, and I reviewed the bills with the Republican caucus.

1097
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:23,500
There's three bills that both committees agree could be exact.

1098
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:26,000
One is House Bill 281.

1099
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,500
And I'll have to pull it out.

1100
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:43,500
House Bill 281 is relative to the tax expenditure report and relative to delaying the enactment of single sales factor under the business profits and business enterprise tax.

1101
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:46,000
This is Representative Bromley's bill.

1102
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,500
It looks like both caucuses are ready to exist.

1103
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:57,500
So why don't I go into executive session on House Bill 281-, Representative Bromney.

1104
02:03:57,500 --> 02:04:03,500
I'd like to make a motion to pass on House Bill 281.

1105
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:06,000
I'd like to second that.

1106
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Representative Bromney.

1107
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
And Representative Ames.

1108
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Chamber.

1109
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Chamber.

1110
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Representative Bromley.

1111
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Yes, just real quick.

1112
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,500
This bill does three things.

1113
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:32,000
It modifies one of the it delays implementation of single sales factor until tax periods ending on or after December 31st of 2026.

1114
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:49,500
And it creates or basically amends and it creates an apportionment committee going forward, a joint committee with the Senate to monitor progress on where we are with the other tax changes that have occurred.

1115
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,500
So market-based sourcing specifically.

1116
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:55,500
So those are the three things it does.

1117
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:12,000
The reasons we're doing that are especially the delay in the implementation date of single sales factor is that we need to have some time to measure the impact of market based sourcing.

1118
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:22,500
We want to make sure market based sourcing increases revenue from service businesses out of state serving clients in New Hampshire.

1119
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:27,500
Remember, our DRA has to find these people out there.

1120
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:32,000
It may take longer than a year to do.

1121
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:40,000
We want to create a solid baseline to measure our moving forward with single sales factor.

1122
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:56,000
and given that so many of our top taxpayers manufacture things that are sold out of state, we do have some concern that this may be a major hit in our revenues.

1123
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
We don't know yet.

1124
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
So we want to delay this until we know better.

1125
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:08,500
And all I'll say is that other states have done this.

1126
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,500
That number grows.

1127
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:19,000
But other states have income tax, personal income tax, sales tax, other things to buffer an error.

1128
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:26,500
And if we make a mistake with this one, we could have a major problem.

1129
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:49,000
And as I mentioned the other day, I heard from the Business Industry Association and their membership, which is pretty large membership, they're the biggest association of this kind in the state, are split on this, which means that they're probably winners and losers here.

1130
02:06:49,000 --> 02:07:04,000
we just don't know you know the winners outnumber the losers on this one so but those are my comments on this I hope we all support OTP on this.

1131
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Representative Ames has a question or a comment.

1132
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I think it's a comment at this stage.

1133
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Can, I'm, can you hear me?

1134
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Yes.

1135
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Yeah, okay.

1136
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,500
Yeah, I was just speaking on this motion, and I do support what to pass.

1137
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:31,000
And Representative Abrami has stated well the basic considerations.

1138
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
It's a very, very important bill.

1139
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:43,000
It's very important that we delay what is now in statute for the startup of single sales factor.

1140
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
We're going too fast into something that we don't understand.

1141
02:07:48,000 --> 02:08:06,000
So allowing a little extra time so that we can look at it, get good information from DRA and know exactly what we're headed into and maybe modify if that's what the information says to us.

1142
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,500
Makes all the sense in the world.

1143
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:16,000
So I hope that we will vote for what to pass on this.

1144
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Chair, can I make another comment?

1145
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Representative Brodney.

1146
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,500
Remember that the Senate flipped us into the last budget, the compromise budget.

1147
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:46,500
They also created a committee, a joint committee for members from the House, three members from the Senate that was supposed to be twice and then voted last November 2020 on whether or not the single sales factor.

1148
02:08:46,500 --> 02:09:04,000
And I think Representative Valenegade reiterated when we talked about this last, that we got guidance when we met, it was almost like they appeased us a bit by putting this clause in this statute.

1149
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,000
But we were told then that that language was constitutional.

1150
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Come came November, last November, when we're trying to get that committee together, we learned that that language wasn't constitutional.

1151
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,000
We had the votes to stop it then.

1152
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:32,500
It was for House because our position as a committee for the new members was to slow this down.

1153
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:45,000
And we never really had a proper hearing on this here in the House, which kind of upsets us, but we can get beyond that.

1154
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,500
But we had the chance to slow it down.

1155
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:59,000
But so that what they put in the legislation to give us a trigger to slow it down disappeared.

1156
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
So it became law.

1157
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,000
And again, it was buried in the budget.

1158
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:11,000
And HB4, it was not HB2 because HB2 was vetoed, became HB4.

1159
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
And that's the story.

1160
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:19,000
So again, as a committee, we never had proper hearings on this.

1161
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:29,000
We want to know why the Senate and why the governor thought this was a great idea to do now.

1162
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
That's all I want to know.

1163
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:48,500
But when we had the hearing on this bill, no one showed up, really, to ask those questions, ask ask us or at least explain to us why we should do this now.

1164
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:51,000
So those are my comments.

1165
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Thank you.

1166
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Any questions?

1167
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Representative Elmer.

1168
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Sorry.

1169
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Yeah.

1170
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:07,500
I think Representative Ames might have been going to say the same thing.

1171
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:16,000
But as far as we can determine, there was never really a hearing in the Senate either.

1172
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:24,000
This was put in HB 4 as something that without which the budget would not pass.

1173
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:35,000
And I do not think that there was a hearing even in the Senate, even on a consolidated bill that included this.

1174
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:47,500
so there's been no chance for the businesses in the BIA, for instance, that seem to be opposed to it, to come forward and talk.

1175
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:57,500
We were hoping they would come forward when we did those two listening sessions, hearings, in the special seven-person committee.

1176
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:13,000
But as I recall, mostly what we got was overviews, which included some very strong warnings against going forward with this before knowing much about what it was going to do.

1177
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:32,000
So we are, I think, going to have to make, if we pass this to the Senate, we are going to need to talk with them about it a lot more clearly than has been done so far.

1178
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:41,500
But it is, as Representative Ames and Representative Abrami said, it is really, really incredibly important to our revenues.

1179
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:53,500
It is possible that we could end up getting rid of a large part of the BET tax, BP tax that we depend on.

1180
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:56,000
Any further questions or comments?

1181
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Say none.

1182
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Then I'll have the clerk follow the motion of ought to pass.

1183
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,500
Bill HB 281, up to pass is the motion.

1184
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:11,000
Let's begin with Representative Abrami.

1185
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Yes.

1186
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Subbing for Representative Griffin is Representative Charles Melvin.

1187
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Yes.

1188
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Representative Ulrich.

1189
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Yes.

1190
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Representative Ober.

1191
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Yes.

1192
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Representative Ulrich.

1193
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Yes.

1194
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Representative Ober.

1195
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yes.

1196
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,500
Clerk, Representative Berstein votes yes.

1197
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,500
Representative Doucette.

1198
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:41,500
Yes.

1199
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:43,500
Representative Elliott.

1200
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:45,500
Yes.

1201
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:47,500
Representative Janigian.

1202
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,500

Representative Nunez.

1204
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,500
Yes.

1205
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:55,500
Thank you.

1206
02:13:55,500 --> 02:13:59,000
Representative Tudor has to be on video.

1207
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Thank you.

1208
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,500
Representative Tudor, turn on your...

02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:05,500
There you go.

1210
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:07,500
And then unmute yourself.

1211
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:09,500
Yes.

1212
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,500
Thank you.

1213
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:13,500
Thank you, Mr.

1214
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,500
Chairman.

1215
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:17,500
And who else?

1216
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:19,500
Representative Almy.

1217

Yes.

1218
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:23,500
Representative Ames.

1219
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:25,500
Yes.

1220
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:27,500
Representative Southworth.

1221
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:29,500
Yes.

1222

Representative Ames.

1223
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,500
Yes.

1224
02:14:33,500 --> 02:14:35,500
Representative Southworth.

1225
02:14:35,500 --> 02:14:37,500
Yes.

1226
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,500
Representative Malloy.

1227
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:41,500
Yes.

1228
02:14:41,500 --> 02:14:43,500
Representative Schamburg.

1229
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:45,500
Yes.

1230
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,500
Representative Tucker.

1231
02:14:47,500 --> 02:14:49,500
Yes.

1232
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:51,500
Representative Go Marlow.

1233
02:14:51,500 --> 02:14:53,500
Yes.

1234
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:55,500
Representative Loughman.

1235
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:57,500
Representative Loughman.

1236
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:59,500
Representative Gorg.

1237
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:01,500
Yes.

1238
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,500
Representative Loughman.

1239
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:05,500
Representative Loughman.

1240
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:07,500
Representative Gorg.

1241
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:09,500
Yes.

1242
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:12,000
I see you on video.

1243
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Thank you.

1244
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Representative Hacken Phillips.

1245
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Yes.

1246
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Representative Murphy.

1247
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Yes.

1248
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Representative Major.

1249
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Yes.

1250
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,500
And then Representative Urali needs to be on video.

1251
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:32,500
Thank you.

1252
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,500
Murphy?

1253
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,500
Yes.

1254
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:38,500
Representative Major?

1255
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:40,500
Yes.

1256
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:45,000
And then Representative Urali needs to be on video.

1257
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,500
Representative Ulrich, could you enable your video and cast your vote?

1258
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:52,500
I don't have video.

1259
02:15:52,500 --> 02:16:27,000
he can't take he can't take place okay i'm going to record uh him as not voting on this therefore the vote is 22 to nothing the vote being 22 to nothing the motion of what to pass on house bill 281 fn passes consent mr chairman okay the next bill mr chair i think it was representative elliott who requested that this be put on the consent calendar.

1260
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Can you speak a little louder?

1261
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Representative Bernstein?

1262
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:38,000
There was a request to put this bill on the consent calendar.

1263
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Yes.

1264
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:47,500
So I think at this point, maybe ask everyone if there's any objection to that.

1265
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:49,500
Okay.

1266
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:55,000
Anybody have any objection going on the consent calendar for 281?

1267
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Representative Alvin?

1268
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Representative Alvin?

1269
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I actually I don't know how my hand went up.

1270
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,500
Every time I move near the computer, it seems to change.

1271
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:12,000
I agree to consent calendar.

1272
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I think it's complicated to explain to the general body.

1273
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,500
and we're all in favor.

1274
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:26,000
So there's nobody that raised their hand in opposition to the consent calendar.

1275
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,000
So we'll go on to consent.

1276
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
sounds.

1277
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,500
The next one is House Bill 353.

1278
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:41,500
And that's one where a lot of work needs to be done on that.

1279
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:46,000
And do I hear a motion to retain that?

1280
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
On House Bill 353?

1281
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,500
I would move to retain.

1282
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:56,500
Sorry, I didn't realize- I'll second it, I had my hand up.

1283
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:00,000
Okay, who made the motion to retain?

1284
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I did.

1285
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Representative Ames.

1286
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Representative Ames.

1287
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
And seconded.

1288
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Bye.

1289
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Second.

1290
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I'll second.

1291
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
2-5-3.

1292
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:21,500
Representative Abramny, Representative Ames, you want to speak to the motion?

1293
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:41,500
I think that the question that's raised by this bill is interesting and potentially there is a significant issue related to whether or not there should be credit for taxes paid to another state on an interest in dividends return.

1294
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:55,500
But there are questions that couldn't be answered in the short time that we've had and that we will have given restrictions of the pandemic that we're experiencing.

1295
02:18:55,500 --> 02:19:04,000
And thus, it seems a very good candidate for more careful consideration through the retained bill process.

1296
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,000
And that's why I have moved for retention.

1297
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Anybody elsements on retaining?

1298
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,500
Representative Major, if I had my hand.

1299
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:15,500
Representative Eleanor.

1300
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,500
Thank you, Mr.

1301
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:19,500
Chairman.

1302
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:27,000
If you'll recall, the DRA testified that they do not think that this is constitutional.

1303
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:35,000
There are two different versions of attacks in consideration, one from Massachusetts, another from New Hampshire.

1304
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
And generally, the U.S.

1305
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:49,500
Supreme Court has ruled that this is not double taxation and that they would be fighting this in court if it came through that way.

1306
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:55,500
And then there was also a question of what it would cost.

1307
02:19:55,500 --> 02:20:09,500
And they said that they could work on a fiscal note, but they didn't really think that they were going to be doing a good job of it.

1308
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:20,000
And we thought perhaps they might do a good job of it if they had the summer to work on it.

1309
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,500
Any further comments or questions?

1310
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:28,500
Seeing none, then I'll ask the clerk to call the roll on.

1311
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:30,500
Retaining House Bill 353.

1312
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:32,500
Thank you, Mr.

1313
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:34,500
Chair.

1314
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:44,000
In the interest of time, I will exclude the word representative so we can just go down this list.

1315
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Let's start the vote with Abrami.

1316
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
But yes.

1317
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Melvin.

1318
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Yes.

1319
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
All agreed.

1320
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
He can't vote.

1321
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,500
He doesn't have his video.

1322
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,500
Got it.

1323
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,500
Ober.

1324
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,500
Yes.

1325
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:07,500
Clark votes yes.

1326
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:09,500
Doucette.

1327
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:11,500
Yes.

1328
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:13,500
Clerk votes yes.

1329
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:15,500
Doucette?

1330
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:17,500
Yes.

1331
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:19,500
Elliot?

1332
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:21,500
Elliot?

1333
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:23,500
Yes.

1334
02:21:23,500 --> 02:21:25,500
Junijian?

1335
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:27,500
Yes.

1336
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:29,500
Nunez?

1337
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:31,500
Yes.

1338
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:33,500
Baxter?

1339
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:35,500
Yes.

1340
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:37,500
Spillsbury?

1341
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:39,500
Yes.

1342
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:41,500
Tudor?

1343
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:43,500
Yes.

1344
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:45,500
Almi?

1345
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:47,500
Yes.

1346
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,500
Yes.

1347
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,500
Bill Burry.

1348
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:53,500
Yes.

1349
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:55,500
Tudor.

1350
02:21:55,500 --> 02:21:57,500
Yes.

1351
02:21:57,500 --> 02:21:59,500
Almi.

1352
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:01,500
Yes.

1353
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,500
Spillsbury.

1354
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:05,500

1355
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:07,500
Tudor.

1356
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:09,500
Yes.

1357
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:11,500
Almy.

1358
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:13,500
Yes.

1359
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:15,500
Ames.

1360
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,500
Yes.

1361
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:19,500
Southworth.

1362
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,500
Yes.

1363
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:23,500
Malloy.

1364
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:25,500
Yes.

1365
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:27,500
Schaumburg.

1366
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:29,500
Yes.

1367
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:31,500
Tucker.

1368
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:33,500
Yes.

1369
02:22:33,500 --> 02:22:35,500
Marlow.

1370
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:37,500
Yes.

1371
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,500
Lothman.

1372
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:41,500
Lothman.

1373
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,500
Gorg.

1374
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:45,500
Yes.

1375
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:47,500
Hacken Phillips.

1376
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:49,500
Yes.

1377
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:51,500
Loughman.

1378
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:53,500
Loughman.

1379
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:55,500
Gorg.

1380
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:57,500
Yes.

1381
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:59,500
Hacken Phillips.

1382
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:01,500
Yes.

1383
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,500
Murphy.

1384
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:05,500
Yes.

1385
02:23:05,500 --> 02:23:07,500
Major.

1386
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:09,500
Yes.

1387
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:11,500
22 to love.

1388
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:13,500
It passed.

1389
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:15,500
22 to zero?

1390
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:17,500
Correct.

1391
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:19,500
Any objections?

1392
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,500
There's no consent calendar for that.

1393
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:26,000
We just recorded out as being retained.

1394
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,500
So the vote to retain 22 to nothing passes.

1395
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:32,500
Mr.

1396
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:42,000
Speaker, may I ask Representative Burstein, on 281, did you get, you did not get a vote from Griffin.

1397
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Is that correct?

1398
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:49,500
Representative Charles Melvin was substituting for Griffin and he voted yes.

1399
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:51,500
Thank you.

1400
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:55,500
And what was Representative Melvin's vote on 353?

1401
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,500
Yes.

1402
02:23:57,500 --> 02:24:00,500
The vote, his vote was yes.

1403
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:02,500
Thank you.

1404
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:04,500
You're welcome.

1405
02:24:04,500 --> 02:24:14,500
The next bill to vote on is House Bill 533, establishing Division of Investigation and Compliance in the Lottery Commission.

1406
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:17,000
Do I have a motion?

1407
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Representative Bromney.

1408
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,500
Yes, I make a motion.

1409
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:24,500
I'll pass on House Bill 533.

1410
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:26,500
Seconded by.

1411
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,500
Second.

1412
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:30,500
Representative Schamburg.

1413
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:32,500
Bromney makes a motion.

1414
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:34,500
I'll pass.

1415
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:36,500
Representative Schamburg seconded it.

1416
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,500
Representative Bromney.

1417
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:40,500
Thank you.

1418
02:24:40,500 --> 02:24:42,500
I think we've had...

1419
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:45,000
Next motion I'll to pass.

1420
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Representative Schamberg seconds it.

1421
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Representative Romney.

1422
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Thank you.

1423
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I think we've had a long discussion on this already.

1424
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:04,000
It creates, it basically codifies what he already has in terms of investigation and compliance people.

1425
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:10,500
He wants to formalize it and make it a division within the lottery.

1426
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:14,000
There are no new staff involved here.

1427
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,500
Understand this is the only early bill we have.

1428
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:21,500
It will be going to finance.

1429
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:24,500
I'll be up here to testify.

1430
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:32,000
But I think they're quickly going to realize there's no FTEs or no new positions.

1431
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:40,000
and then the other thing it does is it changes the relationship, not change the relationship.

1432
02:25:40,000 --> 02:26:01,500
Basically what it does is it picks up more of the duties when it comes to doing facts and meeting information gathering, when it comes to looking at the license that you want to watch our gaming place or those kind of things.

1433
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:03,500
Thank you.

1434
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:25,500
looking at license to those kind of things we really can't hear yes I think it's when perhaps if we're going to have such a long explanation we have to straighten it out or just forego that because we cannot understand what's being said.

1435
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:27,500
All right.

1436
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:29,500
I'll try it again.

1437
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:40,500
So the last thing it does is it, it, it changes the way that the lottery commission works with the AG's office.

1438
02:26:40,500 --> 02:27:11,000
Lottery commission will pick up a lot of the background gathering on people applying for licenses and but remember that the AG's office continues to have make that final call if someone is worthy of or fit to receive a gambling license of any kind and that is my testimony that is my comments and we heard you perfectly clearly then.

1439
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Just for you, Edith.

1440
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
I don't see any.

1441
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Thank you.

1442
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
I don't see any.

1443
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I don't see any.

1444
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Mr.

1445
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Chair, you're muted.

1446
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:31,000
I think I heard you through somebody else's mic saying you're muted.

1447
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Normal, you're muted on your mic.

1448
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Is you're muted?

1449
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Sorry about that.

1450
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,500
I didn't see any other raised hands.

1451
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:45,500
Anybody else want to make comments or questions?

1452
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:51,000
Send none, then I'll ask the clerk to call the roll.

1453
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,500

1513
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:03,500
All right, the vote been 22-0.

1514
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:07,000
The motion passes on House Bill 533.

1515
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,500
Anybody object to putting it on consent?

1516
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:15,000
Anybody object to putting 533 on the consent calendar?

1517
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:19,000
I don't see it, so go on consent.

1518
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Mr.

1519
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Speaker, may I ask Representative Burstein on 353, that vote was to retain, just to confirm?

1520
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
353.

1521
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Correct.

1522
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Thank you.

1523
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Okay.

1524
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
That's all.

1525
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
You're exactly.

1526
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:57,500
Now the rest of them will consider next week when we have our work session on the bills that we hear today and the remainder of the bills we heard on the 28th.

1527
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:01,500
So you can come back at 1 o'clock.

1528
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:07,500
So I would recommend just muting your video and muting your audio.

1529
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:17,000
I wanted to suggest that when you're moving around, there seems to be more back and forth, more echoes.

1530
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Thank you.

1531
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,500
I don't need a nap.

1532
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:23,500
You need a nap.

1533
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:25,500
You really do.

1534
02:31:25,500 --> 02:31:32,000
Representative Elliot, it looks like your video and your audio are still going.

1535
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:39,500
I wanted to make you aware so that you could mute and stop your feed.

1536
02:31:39,500 --> 02:31:42,500
Okay, how do I get out?

1537
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:52,500
You can just turn, if you run your cursor on the bottom of the screen, you can stop your video.

1538
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:54,500
Oh, stop the video?

1539
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:56,500
Okay.

1540
02:31:56,500 --> 02:32:03,500
And then just to the left of that should be stop audio or mute.

1541
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:05,500
Put it on mute.

1542
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:07,500
There you go.

1543
02:32:07,500 --> 02:32:09,500
Perfect.

1544
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:11,500
Thank you.

1545
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:13,500
Thank you.

1546
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,500
Thank you.

1547
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:17,500
Thank you.

1548
02:32:17,500 --> 02:32:19,500
Okay.

1549
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:21,500
Yeah, just set.

1550
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:23,500
Thank you.

1551
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:25,500
Thank you.

1552
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,500
Vielen Dank.

1553
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:29,500
Thank you.

1554
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:31,500
Yes.

1555
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:33,500
Yes.

1556
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,500
Yes.

1557
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:37,500
Yes.

1558
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:39,500
Yes.

1559
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:41,500
Yes.

1560
02:32:41,500 --> 02:32:43,500
Test, test.

1561
02:32:43,500 --> 02:32:45,500
Test, test.

1562
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:47,500
Test, test.

1563
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:49,500
Test.

1564
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,500
Test.

1565
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,500
Test.

1566
02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:55,500
Test.

1567
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:57,500
Test.

1568
02:32:57,500 --> 02:32:59,500
Test.

1569
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:01,500
Test, test, test.

1570
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:03,500
Hello?

1571
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:07,500
Do you have a device on over there?

1572
02:33:07,500 --> 02:33:10,500
I don't have any of that.

1573
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,500
Okay.

1574
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:14,500
Hello?

1575
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:17,000
I think it's this thing.

1576
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
The thing right here, the power?

1577
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Yeah.

1578
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Sorry.

1579
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,500
Yeah, that was the issue.

1580
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:28,500
This whole time.

1581
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:31,000
Do you think that's it?

1582
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Well, that was the issue with the feedback.

1583
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:44,000
The other issue we had this morning was the computer that was hooked up to this completely failed.

1584
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
It's nuts.

1585
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:49,000
It's audio card just stopped working.

1586
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:55,000
So it had no ability to have any microphone input or output.

1587
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Test, test, test.

1588
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
OK.

1589
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
No feedback.

1590
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
That's for sure.

1591
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
No feedback.

1592
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Test, Test.

1593
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
We'll solve it, Aaron.

1594
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,500
I don't know if it's solved yet.

1595
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:14,500
What's the system?

1596
02:34:14,500 --> 02:34:16,500
What's it do?

1597
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:18,500
Brand new.

1598
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:22,000
This picture, let me find it here.

1599
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Thank you.

1600
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,500
I actually hired this guy for YouTube.

1601
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:29,500
return Thank you.

1602
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:31,500
Thank you.

1603
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:33,500
Thank you.

1604
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:36,000
This is an audio test.

1605
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,500
This is an audio test.

1606
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:41,000
Microphone is in the room.

1607
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Test one, two.

1608
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,000
This is just for testing purposes.

1609
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,000
How's the clarity of the audio?

1610
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Very good.

1611
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,500
Okay, thank you very much.

1612
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:55,500
I appreciate that.

1613
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:57,500
Very good.

1614
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:59,500
Okay.

1615
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:01,500
Thank you very much.

1616
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:03,500
I appreciate that.

1617
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:09,500
I'm doing a test by text message and I got live feedback.

1618
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:11,500
Okay.

1619
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:15,500
So I think your room is back online.

1620
02:35:15,500 --> 02:35:17,500
Thank you.

1621
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:19,500
Thank you.

1622
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:21,500
Thank you.

1623
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,500
Thank you.

1624
02:35:23,500 --> 02:35:25,500
Thank you.

1625
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:27,500
Thank you.

1626
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:29,500
Thank you.

1627
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:31,500
Thank you.

1628
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:33,500
Thank you.

1629
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:35,500
Thank you.

1630
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:37,500
Thank you.

1631
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:39,500
Thank you.

1632
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:41,500
Thank you.

1633
02:35:41,500 --> 02:35:43,500
Thank you.

1634
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:45,500
Thank you.

1635
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:47,500
Thank you.

1636
02:35:47,500 --> 02:35:49,500
Thank you.

1637
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:51,500
Thank you.

1638
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:53,500
Thank you.

1639
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:55,500
Thank you.

1640
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:57,500
Thank you.

1641
02:35:57,500 --> 02:35:59,500
Thank you.

1642
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:01,500
Thank you.

1643
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:03,500
Thank you.

1644
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:05,500
Thank you.

1645
02:36:05,500 --> 02:36:07,500
Thank you.

1646
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:09,500
Thank you.

1647
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:11,500
Thank you.

1648
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:13,500
Thank you.

1649
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:15,500
So, Representative Abrami.

1650
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:21,000
Norm's trying it on the regular, you know, the normal system.

1651
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:28,000
So they did a sound check during lunch and it was much, much clearer.

1652
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
All right.

1653
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,500
So let's try this, Norm.

1654
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:34,500
Should.

1655
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:39,000
Let me make sure it's not muted over here.

1656
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:42,500
She said they did a sound check.

1657
02:36:42,500 --> 02:36:44,500
Okay.

1658
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:46,500
One,.

1659
02:36:46,500 --> 02:36:48,500
Testing one, two, three.

1660
02:36:48,500 --> 02:36:50,500
Does that work?

1661
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:52,500
Yeah, that's great.

1662
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:54,500
Is that okay?

1663
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:56,500
Yeah.

1664
02:36:56,500 --> 02:37:10,500
I happen to be where my computer is at lunch, and I heard them do the sound check and was able to tell them how clear it was.

1665
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:12,500
Very nice guy.

1666
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:14,500
Okay.

1667
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:18,500
Well, these speakers aren't working on that speaker.

1668
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:20,500
Yeah.

1669
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:24,500
I'm getting their voice through on my computer.

1670
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:27,000
Oops, there we go again.

1671
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
That's cause of me.

1672
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:34,500
Yeah, make sure you turn down your speakers to Representative Abrami.

1673
02:37:34,500 --> 02:37:39,500
Yeah, I'm gonna turn this off if we get this.

1674
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:47,500
But the sound, the voices aren't coming through the speakers by the screen, the big screen.

1675
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:50,500
You don't need to do that.

1676
02:37:50,500 --> 02:37:59,500
My sense earlier was it made an enormous amount of difference when you leaned in towards your speaker.

1677
02:37:59,500 --> 02:38:01,500
It changed everything.

1678
02:38:01,500 --> 02:39:02,500
Okay, we have but we don't none of the sound is coming out of the speaker in the room so i was just going to sound totally off of zoom uh but until we so when people speak we still can't hear it through the speaker that's in front of the screen here the big screen right now you sound good representative abrami i don't hear an echo when you were speaking just now so you can't hear us is that the problem no i can hear you on my computer i was gonna i was gonna sign off zoom but we're not hearing your voices through the speakers that are in the room but you don't maybe you don't need to.

1679
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:05,500
They had to just set right.

1680
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:09,000
I wouldn't go turning other stuff on.

1681
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Unless you absolutely...

1682
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,000
I'm going to turn my sound down here.

1683
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Okay.

1684
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,500
Let's see if you can hear anybody.

1685
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:23,000
My speaker's down to zero.

1686
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
All right.

1687
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Okay, testing.

1688
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
One, two, three.

1689
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
How's that?

1690
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Perfect.

1691
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Good.

1692
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Good.

1693
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:40,500
Are you hearing it through your computer?

1694
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:42,500
You heard the response.

1695
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:44,500
I heard the response.

1696
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:46,500
The response was like.

1697
02:39:46,500 --> 02:39:48,500
Through your computer, though.

1698
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:54,500
Yeah, I've got to somehow turn up my sound on the receiver.

1699
02:39:54,500 --> 02:40:01,500
So if I turn my computer off totally, I won't be able to hear.

1700
02:40:01,500 --> 02:40:07,000
So Representative Ames, were you aware that your computer was on?

1701
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:11,500
We all heard all your messages from your telephone?

1702
02:40:11,500 --> 02:40:14,000
I couldn't quite hear you.

1703
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,500
No, I didn't hear that.

1704
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:18,500
I didn't know that.

1705
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:21,500
There's something to be aware of.

1706
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:24,000
The Valley News recalled you.

1707
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Oh, really?

1708
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,000
So you've already heard about it last night.

1709
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
No, I haven't.

1710
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,500
I haven't spoken to anyone.

1711
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:36,500
These are just messages.

1712
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:39,500
I'm sorry that they were public.

1713
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:43,000
Yeah, I can hear through that speaker.

1714
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I heard somebody had called me.

1715
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Some of us had our volume down, so we couldn't.

1716
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:57,000
I couldn't get to my computerized telephone book when I'm in Zoom.

1717
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,500
Oh, it's after one o'clock.

1718
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:02,000
I only have one computer.

1719
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,500
I don't have a laptop.

1720
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:08,000
Actually Norm's voice is quite strong now.

1721
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
181, yeah.

1722
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:39,500
representative aims I had my stuff muted but when I turned it on and I heard you I muted you so some of them went up thank you thank you Janine I can hardly hear you are you talking to me representative major yes can everybody else hear me okay yes oh boy I don't know what to say.

1723
02:41:39,500 --> 02:41:41,500
Jennifer?

1724
02:41:41,500 --> 02:41:44,000
Do the best we can.

1725
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:48,500
I'll try and speak up when I need to.

1726
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:50,500
Is that better?

1727
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:52,500
Yes.

1728
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,500
Okay.

1729
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:56,500
Hi, y'all.

1730
02:41:56,500 --> 02:41:58,500
Woo.

1731
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,500
Yes.

1732
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:05,500
Okay, might as well get started on the next hearing.

1733
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:18,000
I'm going to open a public hearing on House Bill 181, an act relative to the local options for operation of sports book retail locations.

1734
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:24,000
And I'm not sure who to let in because nobody signed up.

1735
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:30,500
Michael O'Brien is this, I want to know, Michael O'Brien is this prime.

1736
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:35,500
Yeah, and I don't see that name on the attendees.

1737
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:37,500
Cody.

1738
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:43,000
Representative Cody is on the attendee list but he's not testifying.

1739
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
It's not on mine.

1740
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:49,000
let's ask him if there's anybody out there.

1741
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Yeah.

1742
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Is there anybody there?

1743
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Raise your hand if you if you're going to introduce the bill.

1744
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Introduce the bill.

1745
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:06,500
Is there anybody that's going to be introducing House Bill 181?

1746
02:43:06,500 --> 02:43:17,000
It's sponsors are Representative O'Brien from Hillsborough, Representative Tolesky from Hillsborough, Representative Cody from Hillsborough, and Senator Rosenwald from District 13.

1747
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
I got one.

1748
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Tolesky will testify.

1749
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Talking permitted.

1750
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Good afternoon.

1751
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Yes, we hear you.

1752
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Thank you.

1753
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I apologize.

1754
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:36,500
I didn't receive any notice that Representative O'Brien wouldn't be here.

1755
02:43:36,500 --> 02:43:41,000
I just happened to join to follow the proceeding.

1756
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:46,500
So I suppose I will present the bill on his behalf.

1757
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:56,000
I apologize if I don't have any necessary information or I'm able to answer any questions you might have.

1758
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:09,500
House Bill 181 came about as a result of the question on sports betting failing on one of our Nashua ballots by a very, very slim margin.

1759
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:23,000
When we looked at the possibility of resubmitting the question, we saw that the existing statute limited us as to which ballots we could put it on.

1760
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:31,500
This bill was submitted last year with the hopes of getting it on the state primary ballot.

1761
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:59,500
At this point, since the state primary has passed, I'm not exactly sure as to what the intention was with Representative O'Brien filing it again, but I do believe they were looking for flexibility in terms of being able to put the question on a ballot at a different election instead of just the municipal election.

1762
02:44:59,500 --> 02:45:03,500
And that's what I understand of the issue.

1763
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:05,500
Well, thank you, Representative.

1764
02:45:05,500 --> 02:45:08,000
Would you take any questions?

1765
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
I can try.

1766
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,500
Do we have any questions?

1767
02:45:12,500 --> 02:45:14,500
Yeah, I do.

1768
02:45:14,500 --> 02:45:18,000
Robson Ames, do you have a question?

1769
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I do.

1770
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
I'm sorry.

1771
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I was trying to find the raise my hand icon.

1772
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:40,500
But yeah, I wonder if you can tell us what the relative turnout in numbers is between a primary election and the other actions that are available.

1773
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:43,000
I'm sorry I interrupted you.

1774
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:51,500
I don't actually know specific details of the numbers for a municipal turnout versus a state primary.

1775
02:45:51,500 --> 02:46:01,500
I do know that there was concerns about the limitation on the number of licenses that would be going out.

1776
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:10,000
And Nashville wanted to try one more time to get it on the ballot to our voters.

1777
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:33,000
We feel that there just wasn't enough time to educate the voters about the issues and felt like if we had a chance to explain the benefits that our local nonprofits could receive from the program, that we would have a better turnout on the question.

1778
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:41,500
In terms of your, I'm sorry, I don't know the answer specifically to the number of voters.

1779
02:46:41,500 --> 02:46:43,500
Okay, thank you.

1780
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:45,500
Representative Romney.

1781
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:48,500
So thank you for your testimony.

1782
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:54,000
Do we know how many, I guess, cities have biannual elections?

1783
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,500
Does Nashville have biannual elections?

1784
02:46:56,500 --> 02:46:59,000
Thank you for the question.

1785
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Yes, our municipality has on off years of the state elections, we have our municipal elections.

1786
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:13,500
So the only option is to do it in the September primary election.

1787
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:18,000
Is that what I'm hearing on the off year?

1788
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:22,000
That was what the plan was to do.

1789
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:30,000
But, and this was a bill was put in one of the omnibus bills last June.

1790
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:40,500
I don't know specifically which one it was put into, but it was a bunch of of administrative kind of changes.

1791
02:47:40,500 --> 02:47:44,000
And it was vetoed by the governor.

1792
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:54,000
So that situation of getting it onto the September primary that happened just this past year, we lost that opportunity.

1793
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:11,000
And like I said, the fact that Representative O'Brien, I'm not sure what his plan was, if him not being here was a change in the intention of the bill, I have no idea.

1794
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,500
And I apologize about that.

1795
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:16,000
Representative Major, may I interrupt?

1796
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Go ahead.

1797
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:27,500
I guess the question for ways and means would be, should we allow town to have a second chance?

1798
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:46,000
And I think we do this with other things like Keno and other kind of lottery kind of things that we allow a town to continue to vote to be able to bring this up on ballot.

1799
02:48:46,000 --> 02:49:00,500
So, and I guess the only reason that I see this bill here is I haven't had a chance to look at the original language of the sports book.

1800
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:09,000
I'm surprised if it didn't have language that said it could be brought up again and again.

1801
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Is that your understanding that it doesn't have that kind of language or is it just this biannual issue that affects Nashua that we're we're talking about here?

1802
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:31,000
I'm pretty sure it was the biannual issue that affects Nashua that we're talking about here?

1803
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:56,000
I'm pretty sure it was the biannual issue that the fear that the, I believe it's 10, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, it's 10 licenses that are available, that they would be all distributed before we had the chance to ask the question again two years later.

1804
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,500
I see what you're saying.

1805
02:49:58,500 --> 02:50:02,500
Yeah, two licenses have been issued so far.

1806
02:50:02,500 --> 02:50:07,500
So, okay, so, but is your, when's your next election?

1807
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:10,500
Is it this, is it this?

1808
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:13,000
November 20, it's November 2021.

1809
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
November 2021.

1810
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Okay.

1811
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Thank you.

1812
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Thank you.

1813
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,500
Representative Major, this is Jenny.

1814
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:29,000
There are three people here from Lottery, just so you know.

1815
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Okay.

1816
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,500
There is Representative Tom Southworth.

1817
02:50:33,500 --> 02:50:35,500
Thank you, Mr.

1818
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:37,500
Chairman.

1819
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:41,000
I think you've partly answered the question.

1820
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:47,500
For Nashua's issue, again, you're going to do the vote again in November.

1821
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:52,500
So in some respect, your issue is solved for now.

1822
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,000
Thank you for the question.

1823
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:00,000
That was one that I was trying to figure out.

1824
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I know that we were all co-sponsors on this bill last year um and as far as and i apologize again that i don't know if there were other conversations that happened um between the prime sponsor and everyone else but um that was the plan that uh we would move forward with the bill but yes according to the the fact that that municipal elections can have the question right now, I believe that would be work out for Nash when we would have it in November.

1825
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Thank you.

1826
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Thank you very much.

1827
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Representative Alamey.

1828
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Thank you, Mr.

1829
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Chairman.

1830
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:59,000
So I'm guessing your biennial municipal election is this year?

1831
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Yes.

1832
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Yes.

1833
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Okay.

1834
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:16,500
And the other part was about the September state primary election was added because you hoped the bill would be passed last year.

1835
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:18,500
Correct.

1836
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:21,000
Can we take it out?

1837
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:26,000
It seems to be only Nashua that's affected by this.

1838
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
That I don't know.

1839
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,500
Any other questions or comments?

1840
02:52:30,500 --> 02:52:32,500
Mr.

1841
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:34,500
Chairman, if I may?

1842
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:36,500
Yes.

1843
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:45,000
I will make some phone calls and make sure that nothing has changed with the prime sponsor.

1844
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:52,500
And I would like to be able to give you an update on the status.

1845
02:52:52,500 --> 02:53:01,500
And again, I apologize if the intention of the prime sponsor was to not have the bill presented.

1846
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:27,000
but felt a responsibility since I was viewing the the hearing to step up and at least give you the facts behind the bill if that would be okay I can do that that's fine we'll continue this bill the next time we meet and i think that's the 10th right?

1847
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,500
Yeah let's hear a lot.

1848
02:53:29,500 --> 02:53:32,000
But we'll hear from lottery.

1849
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Thank you.

1850
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,500
Who is it from lottery?

1851
02:53:36,500 --> 02:53:38,500
It's Charlie.

1852
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:49,000
Charlie and there's Danny Maloney and there's John Conforti and I've allowed them all to talk so they can decide who.

1853
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,500
Charlie McIntyre Good afternoon, Mr.

1854
02:53:51,500 --> 02:53:54,000
Chair, members of the committee.

1855
02:53:54,000 --> 02:54:05,000
This is Charlie McIntyre speaking for the lottery at first and happy to answer your questions you have related to this bill.

1856
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,500
Obviously this wasn't our submission.

1857
02:54:07,500 --> 02:54:12,500
This was membership from Nashua that wanted this bill filed.

1858
02:54:12,500 --> 02:54:14,500
Thank you.

1859
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:16,500
submission.

1860
02:54:16,500 --> 02:54:21,500
This was membership from Nashua that wanted this bill filed.

1861
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:24,000
Charlie, can you repeat that?

1862
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Certainly.

1863
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Yeah.

1864
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
No, that's true.

1865
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:42,500
Obviously, Nashua being a gateway city to New Hampshire, I think they were looking to have another chance to vote last fall in their election.

1866
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:49,000
I do believe they plan on putting it on a ballot this fall.

1867
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:57,000
And certainly for us, Nashville represents an important location for a facility, for a sports book.

1868
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:13,500
And with the speed Massachusetts seems to be moving at, we would like to do this obviously as fast as possible because we do have an interest in having a location in Nashville.

1869
02:55:13,500 --> 02:55:15,500
All right.

1870
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:17,500
Any questions of Charlie?

1871
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,500
Susan?

1872
02:55:19,500 --> 02:55:21,500
I mean, Representative Almey.

1873
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:23,500
Thank you.

1874
02:55:23,500 --> 02:55:25,500
and Charlie is there.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1875
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:28,000
Thank you for the question.

1876
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:31,500
I don't know the answer to that.

1877
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:34,000
I only know about Nashua.

1878
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,500
Do I have a question?

1879
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:38,500
Representative Bromney.

1880
02:55:38,500 --> 02:55:40,500
Charlie, Representative Bromney.

1881
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:45,500
So the statutes are pretty clear that they can revote.

1882
02:55:45,500 --> 02:56:01,500
It sounds like Nashua has an interesting situation here that's different, but it looks like this coming year, if we pass this, it would be a vote in September instead of November.

1883
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:05,500
They're able to vote in November on this.

1884
02:56:05,500 --> 02:56:10,500
So it doesn't appear that there's an issue for now.

1885
02:56:10,500 --> 02:56:24,000
I guess we're going to hear back from the representative who introduced the bill as to whether we need to modify this or even have this bill.

1886
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Is that your understanding?

1887
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Is that what your take on this is as well?

1888
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I mean, I can, Representative Armby, I can certainly suggest to you that a two-month difference for us would be helpful versus September versus November only because we will be competing for Massachusetts customers there and two months of lead time will help if that's the difference in the bill.

1889
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Okay thank you so it would make a difference okay thank you.

1890
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,500
Any further questions or comments?

1891
02:57:04,500 --> 02:57:06,500
Yes.

1892
02:57:06,500 --> 02:57:08,500
Representative Alame.

1893
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:10,500
Thank you.

1894
02:57:10,500 --> 02:57:13,500
Maybe I'm reading the bill wrong.

1895
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:23,500
As I understand it, it allows you to do this at the next annual town meeting or regular municipal election.

1896
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:28,000
That's going to be in November at this point.

1897
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:38,500
And, but a city with biannual elections, which is Nashua, may conduct the vote on at the September state primary election.

1898
02:57:38,500 --> 02:57:43,000
There is no September state primary election this year.

1899
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Of course.

1900
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:51,500
Okay, then obviously we will wait for November if that is the case.

1901
02:57:51,500 --> 02:57:59,500
And if that is the case, isn't it true that the law also already allows it?

1902
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:01,500
Representative Abrami probably knows.

1903
02:58:01,500 --> 02:58:05,500
Do you have an answer for that, Charlie?

1904
02:58:05,500 --> 02:58:07,500
Yeah, certainly.

1905
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:23,000
I mean, the benefit obviously would be if it doesn't pass this fall, that it would be available to be voted upon next fall without having to refile a bill again.

1906
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
No, but without the...

1907
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Okay.

1908
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Are you all set, Representative Alony?

1909
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Yes, I...

1910
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Representative Southwood.

1911
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Thank you.

1912
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Can you hear me all right?

1913
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Yes.

1914
02:58:41,000 --> 02:59:05,000
My question would be, elections do have different kinds of turnouts, and I would be concerned municipal elections really have a different focus than primaries, and to me, something like this really is localized, and at least initially, I would think it would belong in the municipal category.

1915
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Thank you.

1916
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,500
Any other questions or comments?

1917
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:12,000
Here we go, one more.

1918
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:15,000
I'm simply unfamiliar with this question.

1919
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:20,000
I've never seen a substantive question put at a primary.

1920
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,500
Is there precedent for this?

1921
02:59:22,500 --> 02:59:24,500
Should I restate?

1922
02:59:24,500 --> 02:59:26,500
I couldn't hear you.

1923
02:59:26,500 --> 02:59:28,500
Okay.

1924
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:32,000
My question is simply out of unfamiliarity.

1925
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:39,500
I've never seen a substantive question of this sort put on a primary election ballot.

1926
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:42,500
Is there any precedent for it?

1927
02:59:42,500 --> 02:59:45,000
Who wants to answer that?

1928
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:49,000
I think we need to ask election law.

1929
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Yeah, makes sense.

1930
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Actually, surprise isn't It wasn't an early bill.

1931
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
Yeah.

1932
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
All right.

1933
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
I don't see.

1934
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Yeah.

1935
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
All right.

1936
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:08,000
I don't see anybody signed up.

1937
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:11,000
So and nobody else would testify.

1938
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:17,000
So I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 181.

1939
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Okay.

1940
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
Okay.

1941
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:28,000
We've got another six minutes to wait to hear the public hearing on hospital.

1942
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
3.30.

1943
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:53,000
shall I keep the three lottery gentlemen in here or put them back to attendees or not talking uh we can't hear you i just asked if i should leave lottery on because the next two have to do with lottery yes okay thank you lottery.

1944
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Yes.

1945
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Okay.

1946
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
Thank you.

1947
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Good afternoon, Ways and Means Committee.

1948
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Thank you.

1949
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:07,500
He's going to go where we can.

1950
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:13,000
We should have asked on municipal expert about this last one.

1951
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Yeah.

1952
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:18,500
That seemed kind of odd though, right?

1953
03:01:18,500 --> 03:01:22,500
There's something on a primary ballot like this.

1954
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:24,500
Yeah.

1955
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:26,500
Mr.

1956
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:28,500
Chair.

1957
03:01:28,500 --> 03:01:38,500
We'll have a discussion I guess my mic is live huh I have no way of turning it off, so.

1958
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:40,500
Yeah.

1959
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:43,500
Are you part of norms, Mike?

1960
03:01:43,500 --> 03:01:49,500
Because I don't even see your name up here anymore, Representative Abrami.

1961
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:52,500
Oh, I turned my computer off.

1962
03:01:52,500 --> 03:01:54,500
Oh, okay.

1963
03:01:54,500 --> 03:02:04,000
I'm just looking at you guys on the big screen and using the mic that's connected to the computer.

1964
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Okay.

1965
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Computer here.

1966
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Yeah.

1967
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,500
The main soundboard, I guess.

1968
03:02:12,500 --> 03:02:17,500
And Representative Lang is in the room when you're ready.

1969
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:20,500
Well, his room, but our room.

1970
03:02:20,500 --> 03:02:22,500
Good afternoon, everybody.

1971
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:24,500
No, no, no.

1972
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:26,500
Not ready yet.

1973
03:02:26,500 --> 03:02:29,000
You just hanged it afternoon.

1974
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Yeah.

1975
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:34,000
We have to wait till 1.30.

1976
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
Thank you.

1977
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
Thank you.

1978
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Thank you.

1979
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Well, we're waiting just to remind the committee that we will have a work session on all the bills that we've heard thus far.

1980
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:59,000
And that's gonna be on the 10th of next week, which would be Wednesday.

1981
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:04,500
So if you have any amendments, bring them in that day.

1982
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:06,500
The bills.

1983
03:03:06,500 --> 03:03:16,000
We're going to have work session on revenues on Tuesday, and then work session on the bills on Wednesday.

1984
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Mr.

1985
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:23,500
Chair, tip-off for both of those days is 9 o'clock AM.

1986
03:03:23,500 --> 03:03:25,500
Is that correct?

1987
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:27,500
Yes.

1988
03:03:27,500 --> 03:03:32,500
So it's Wednesday the 10th and then the next Wednesday?

1989
03:03:32,500 --> 03:03:40,500
I think he said Tuesday the 9th and Wednesday the 10th and then the next Wednesday?

1990
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:46,000
I think he said Tuesday the 9th and Wednesday the 10th.

1991
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,500
No, he said two Wednesdays.

1992
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:50,500
New bills.

1993
03:03:50,500 --> 03:03:54,000
So the 10th is just what's up.

1994
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:59,500
And hopefully we'll be able to get some more bills out.

1995
03:03:59,500 --> 03:04:01,500
Exactly.

1996
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:03,500
All right, we're ready.

1997
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:11,500
Then I'll open the public hearing on House Bill 330, an act relative to sports locations.

1998
03:04:11,500 --> 03:04:15,000
The prime sponsor here is Representative Lang.

1999
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Representative Lang, you want to introduce your bill.

2000
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,500
Thank you very much, Mr.

2001
03:04:21,500 --> 03:04:23,500
Chairman.

2002
03:04:23,500 --> 03:04:28,500
Thank you, members of the House Ways and Means Committee.

2003
03:04:28,500 --> 03:04:38,000
I present House Bill 330 to you, a nice one-page simple bill, which you're probably not used to seeing.

2004
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,000
This bill does two basic things.

2005
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:50,500
The first thing it does is it allows what's called tier two betting, um, tier two at retail locations.

2006
03:04:50,500 --> 03:05:02,500
Um, in my original bill that I sponsored back in 2019, uh, for sports betting, tier two betting was allowed in the retail locations.

2007
03:05:02,500 --> 03:05:07,000
And then it passed the house, including retail locations.

2008
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:16,500
But when it made it over to the Senate, the Senate took out tier two betting at retail locations.

2009
03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:25,000
And the reason I included this back in is, A, it's just illogical not to include it.

2010
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:33,000
If you understand what tier two betting is, tier two betting is what's called in-game betting.

2011
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:38,000
And so say this Sunday, the Super Bowl kicks off.

2012
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:52,000
And after the kickoff, I decide I want to place a wager on who's going to score the most points in the second half of the Super Bowl.

2013
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:58,500
I would could open up my app and I could place that bet.

2014
03:05:58,500 --> 03:06:20,000
however if I was at a sports book retail location like the brook out in um uh the Seabrook or the one in Manchester, and the name's escaping me right now, I could not go up to the cage and place that bet.

2015
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:40,000
I would have to take out my phone and I could place that bet while I'm in that location, but I literally cannot go in and place a bet for an in-game bet while I'm at the retail sports locations.

2016
03:06:40,000 --> 03:07:02,000
It just seemed a little illogical to me, the fact that I can't do it when I'm sitting in there and help with the ancillary revenue for that business, but I could whip out my phone and I could do it on my phone.

2017
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:05,000
It just seems illogical to me.

2018
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:16,500
And I think it will help both the businesses as well as the revenue projection, increased revenues for allowing that tier two betting.

2019
03:07:16,500 --> 03:07:35,000
The second thing this bill does is, again, which wasn't in my original bill, the original bill was modified to put a limit on the number of locations throughout the state that sports betting could be offered.

2020
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:39,500
And they put a 10 retail location cap on.

2021
03:07:39,500 --> 03:07:44,000
This bill just removes that cap, that artificial cap.

2022
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:51,500
My conversations with Charlie McIntyre, I honestly don't know that we'll ever get over 10.

2023
03:07:51,500 --> 03:08:03,000
I just don't like the idea that we artificially limit what retail operations can happen within a state by it within a statute.

2024
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:15,500
So as the state grows and as this opportunities grow, I want the statute to be future proof and allow for that growth to happen.

2025
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:26,000
Charlie has done a phenomenal job over at Lottery, and I am sure that he will manage the locations as necessary.

2026
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:33,000
Again, the number of locations was kind of a dark throw that they made.

2027
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:39,000
I don't know that there's any logic behind what number there's there.

2028
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
They've been picking 10.

2029
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:54,000
It was just the number that for some reason, I think it was the House put on last in 19 and added it to the bill.

2030
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:01,000
I'd like to see it removed and let the free market manage this process.

2031
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:08,500
If the business owner wants to open a business, it's his, his return on investment.

2032
03:09:08,500 --> 03:09:16,000
He has to decide whether it's profitable for him or not and let that happen.

2033
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:26,500
And the last thing I'll say is that sports book has done, been done great for the state of New Hampshire.

2034
03:09:26,500 --> 03:09:42,500
I'm sure Charlie might give the most current numbers, but we've seen some, you know, over $10 million given to education through this one simple new law we put in in 2019.

2035
03:09:42,500 --> 03:09:46,500
And so I'd like to see that continue.

2036
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:54,000
I'd like to see our charity, the casino charity gaming operations be able to thrive.

2037
03:09:54,000 --> 03:10:03,500
And I believe that this simple change in these two, in this one set of statutes will do that.

2038
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:08,500
I'm happy to take questions, but also understand Charlie's here.

2039
03:10:08,500 --> 03:10:17,500
And if you have questions about how Lottery's doing on the revenues, he'd be the guy to ask.

2040
03:10:17,500 --> 03:10:21,500
Thank you for taking my hand, Professor Lang.

2041
03:10:21,500 --> 03:10:33,000
On line four, can you remind us what Tier 3, it looks like we had Tier 1 and then they added Tier 2.

2042
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:38,500
So in line four it goes and Tier 3 sports wagers.

2043
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:41,500
What are tier three sports wagers?

2044
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:49,500
So tier three, per the statute, the definition in the RSA is tier three sports wager.

2045
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:56,000
It means a sports wager that is neither tier one or tier two.

2046
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:09,000
So if it doesn't fit in the pregame bet and it doesn't fit in the current game bet, my understanding, then it's a tier three bet.

2047
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:21,500
And my understanding, this was an opening that allowed lottery to create lottery products that they could offer that would be classified as sports wager.

2048
03:11:21,500 --> 03:11:26,500
And again, Charlie might be the better person to ask.

2049
03:11:26,500 --> 03:11:35,500
But that was my understanding was tier three is a lottery product as compared to a DraftKings product.

2050
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:37,500
Follow up.

2051
03:11:37,500 --> 03:11:39,500
Follow up.

2052
03:11:39,500 --> 03:11:41,500
There's a link.

2053
03:11:41,500 --> 03:11:45,500
So you're saying that this was renumbered then?

2054
03:11:45,500 --> 03:11:50,000
It was tier one, then tier two was added.

2055
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:54,000
Was tier three, was that tier two before?

2056
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
Nope.

2057
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:05,000
So the original language of the bill just had tier one and three, they took out tier two.

2058
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:28,500
And so I, so I added tier two back in allow again for that situation where if I'm sitting watching a Superbowl, I could go place a bet on what's going to happen in the second half of the game during the first half of the game.

2059
03:12:28,500 --> 03:12:30,500
Okay.

2060
03:12:30,500 --> 03:12:35,500
So it was approved with the tier three in it.

2061
03:12:35,500 --> 03:12:37,500
Thank you.

2062
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:39,500
Yeah.

2063
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:41,500
Okay.

2064
03:12:41,500 --> 03:12:51,500
Before we go to Charlie, we have one other person who wants to speak and support, and that's Craig Moore.

2065
03:12:51,500 --> 03:12:56,000
Susan, I mean, Representative Elmy, you have a question?

2066
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Yes, I did.

2067
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:32,500
I learned after we passed the sports betting stuff that from Willis Griffith, who is no longer on this committee, I saw you last week, and I learned that he was really worried that the younger people, which he represents, would use the tier two type of bedding to compulsively be bedding all the time when they were supposed to be working or looking for a job or something.

2068
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:44,000
And it seems to me ironic that we have it for the phones, but we do not have it for the physical associations.

2069
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:55,000
And I was wondering if I've got that right to Representative Lang, who knows much more about these things than I do.

2070
03:13:55,000 --> 03:14:03,500
So thank you for the question, Representative Alvami, and it was very seeing you again as well.

2071
03:14:03,500 --> 03:14:07,500
So I'm sure Charlie can talk about that.

2072
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:15,000
We built into the law problem gaming aspect of this and reporting on problem gaming.

2073
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:23,000
And to my knowledge, we haven't had any problems with tier two betting on the phone.

2074
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
That has been problematic.

2075
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:31,500
And that there's even a self-blocking feature within the applications that would block.

2076
03:14:31,500 --> 03:14:35,000
You can stop that tier two bet.

2077
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:41,000
So to my knowledge, there's been no issue with this compulsive behavior.

2078
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:43,000
It hasn't manifested itself.

2079
03:14:43,000 --> 03:15:06,500
But even before we even waited for it to manifest itself, we did put in some criteria in the law about reporting and self-reporting and analytics regarding this kind of activity so that it can be captured by the businesses we have this private partner relationship with.

2080
03:15:06,500 --> 03:15:21,500
and I know that DraftKings has a relationship and I can't remember the name of the business they work with that developed the analytics to watch for compulsive gaming behaviors.

2081
03:15:21,500 --> 03:15:31,500
But I do know they have that built into the application and built into the system to protect against that.

2082
03:15:31,500 --> 03:15:33,500
All right.

2083
03:15:33,500 --> 03:15:35,500
No more questions.

2084
03:15:35,500 --> 03:15:40,500
So, Greg Moore representing Americans for Prosperity in New Hampshire.

2085
03:15:40,500 --> 03:15:42,500
Thank you.

2086
03:15:42,500 --> 03:15:44,500
Thank you.

2087
03:15:44,500 --> 03:15:46,500
Sorry.

2088
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:48,500
Thank you, Mr.

2089
03:15:48,500 --> 03:15:51,000
Chairman, members of the committee.

2090
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,500
My name is Greg Moore.

2091
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:59,500
I'm the state director with Americans for Prosperity here in New Hampshire.

2092
03:15:59,500 --> 03:16:11,000
And we're supportive of House Bill 330, largely because of the secondary provision of removing the cap on the number of physical locations.

2093
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:24,500
And while, as the sponsor said, we may never get to the point where we come even close to having 10 of these facilities across the state.

2094
03:16:24,500 --> 03:16:37,000
We think it's critical to have a good competitive marketplace in order to have high quality, high value facilities for the consumers across the state.

2095
03:16:37,000 --> 03:17:07,500
And we also just feel as though, as soon as you put an artificial cap on an entity, you end up with a dynamic much like the proverbial New York City taxi medallions, which ultimately can create a situation where the actual license itself becomes a thing of value versus putting the focus instead on the quality product for the consumers.

2096
03:17:07,500 --> 03:17:13,000
This is, I think, a very positive step making this change.

2097
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:34,500
It will ensure that the lottery doesn't have to pick and choose among potential good locations across the state right now, considering that the actual location is one of the criteria in the statute for the siting of these, given the limited number.

2098
03:17:34,500 --> 03:17:43,500
It's likely that, for example, a city like Manchester would never see another potential facility in the city.

2099
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:56,000
Well, that means that ultimately the quality for that facility obviously doesn't need to be particularly high if it's literally the only show in town.

2100
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:12,500
and having the ability to have a competitor come into the nearby market and be able to join, which results in a better value for the consumer, we view that as a positive.

2101
03:18:12,500 --> 03:18:21,000
Also, as we heard in the last bill that came before this committee, times and opinions change.

2102
03:18:21,000 --> 03:19:19,000
So if a town didn't provide a local option at the first onset, and then all 10 licenses are given up up but then they decided that they would like to try to have a sports gaming facility in their community well then too bad the the train has left the station and you either would need to wait for one of these facilities to fold which again because it's because of the nature of the law it's unlikely any of these facilities would ever fold they'd probably sell and they would be able to sell at a premium, again, much like a taxi medallion, because the actual contract has a value in and of itself.

2103
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:34,500
So for all those reasons, we think it's important to encourage strong competition and ultimately provide more consumer choice, which I think benefits everybody, including state revenues over the long term.

2104
03:19:34,500 --> 03:19:42,000
So thank you for the time to speak here today and I welcome any questions.

2105
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:44,000
Any questions for Mr.

2106
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:46,000
Moore?

2107
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:48,000
Representative Schoenberg.

2108
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,000
Mr.

2109
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:56,500
Moore, are you suggesting then that just a free market or a limit?

2110
03:19:56,500 --> 03:19:59,000
I couldn't quite hear you.

2111
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,500
We can't hear from here.

2112
03:20:01,500 --> 03:20:03,500
I apologize.

2113
03:20:03,500 --> 03:20:11,000
Yes, we believe that having no limitations on an actual cap is the appropriate strategy.

2114
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:16,500
So we're supportive of the second part of Representative Lange's bill.

2115
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:21,500
I mean, the first part makes sense, too, to me.

2116
03:20:21,500 --> 03:20:28,000
But our real focus is on the second part of the Lang's bill.

2117
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:44,000
I mean, the first part makes sense too, to me, but our real focus is on the second part of the legislation, the aspect that eliminates the cap of 10 total licensees.

2118
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
Thank you.

2119
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
Further questions on Mr.

2120
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:50,000
Moore?

2121
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:54,500
I don't see any, so Charlie McIntyre is here.

2122
03:20:54,500 --> 03:20:56,500
Charlie.

2123
03:20:56,500 --> 03:20:58,500
Good afternoon again Mr.

2124
03:20:58,500 --> 03:21:01,000
Chairman, members of the committee.

2125
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
Charlie McIntyre here.

2126
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:12,000
Certainly this bill in terms of opening up tier two to the retail facilities makes sense to us.

2127
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:35,000
There are a number of wagers that can be placed as Representative Lang correctly points out regarding like, you know, who wins the third quarter, how many total points are scored, bets that can happen in game at the retail locations, which makes sense to us.

2128
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:39,500
As you know, obviously we only have two locations.

2129
03:21:39,500 --> 03:22:01,000
So 10 would be a lot for us, but certainly no opposition to removing the cap and allowing the businesses that we talk to decide whether it's in their best interest to open up a retail sports book with our regulations or not.

2130
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:08,500
And happy to answer any questions you or the members of the committee may have.

2131
03:22:08,500 --> 03:22:10,500
Representative Romlee.

2132
03:22:10,500 --> 03:22:12,500
Hi, Charlie.

2133
03:22:12,500 --> 03:22:14,500
How are you doing?

2134
03:22:14,500 --> 03:22:19,500
I have a question for each piece of this bill.

2135
03:22:19,500 --> 03:22:56,000
So I've spoken to the folks at Seabrook and at Manchester who have sportsbook, and they're very, well, they have people from out of state, especially at Seabrook that are there, they're in the chairs and they feel that they really should be allowed to have, and then when these folks go to do the tier two vetting, they have to go to their phones and they feel that they are being short-term.

2136
03:22:56,000 --> 03:23:05,000
These people are in their building and they don't get any credit, if you will, for that bet.

2137
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:11,000
And so have you heard the same concerns from those two locations?

2138
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:15,000
Yeah, President Bobby, thank you for the question.

2139
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:36,000
We have, we have had the number of reports that folks are playing on the phone while seated at a facility and it's causing them lost revenues in terms of obviously not just the wager but also not consuming food and beverages.

2140
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,500
So yes, we've heard those.

2141
03:23:38,500 --> 03:23:40,500
Follow up.

2142
03:23:40,500 --> 03:24:02,500
So in terms of the increasing the number from 10, I don't know if at this point I'm not convinced that's a good idea, but it seems to me that it would really kind of thin out the risk that these folks are taking.

2143
03:24:02,500 --> 03:24:15,000
You may want to explain how this works and that the actual facilities, there isn't like absolutely no risk for them when these bets occur.

2144
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:19,500
Can you explain that risk that they take, Charlie?

2145
03:24:19,500 --> 03:24:21,500
Certainly.

2146
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:29,000
Based on our existing structure, a facility shares in the risk along with the state.

2147
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:39,500
It receives a percentage of the win for the month, but also is credited or debited a loss for the month.

2148
03:24:39,500 --> 03:24:52,000
Like, for example, there are months the state at a physical retail book will lose money if one popular team wins versus an unpopular team.

2149
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:56,500
And so there are swings monthly back and forth.

2150
03:24:56,500 --> 03:25:01,000
Now, over the course of the year, it's positive.

2151
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:06,000
We make money at this, but it's a risk factor.

2152
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:47,000
And based on our regulations, as well as the regulations of DraftKings, it is an expensive proposition to open up a retail sports book it's many many hundreds of thousands of dollars just in labor costs to run a physical sports book because of all the necessary regulations we have at these facilities because there is indeed a lot of money going through them both through both facilities now so they share risk with us there's not a guaranteed return for them.

2153
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
If that's your question.

2154
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:51,000
Thank you.

2155
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,000
Okay.

2156
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:55,000
Representative Almey.

2157
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:57,000
Thank you.

2158
03:25:57,000 --> 03:25:59,000
Yeah.

2159
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:09,500
I was wondering if Charlie has any idea why, are there others not applying or they're not capable of handling it?

2160
03:26:09,500 --> 03:26:13,500
Why are there only two at this point?

2161
03:26:13,500 --> 03:26:17,000
Well, obviously, we want to start slow.

2162
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:23,000
So these are the first two we identified as being disparate regionally.

2163
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:36,000
And COVID got in the way, candidly, because of the social distancing and that adding to expenses and adding to or detracting from additional revenue options.

2164
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:41,500
You can't have folks seated close together on all those things.

2165
03:26:41,500 --> 03:26:46,500
And so we've had a number of meetings with people.

2166
03:26:46,500 --> 03:26:54,500
We've also, DraftKings has been contacted by folks, and we will be opening up further locations.

2167
03:26:54,500 --> 03:27:01,000
It was just hard to do it in the middle of a pandemic.

2168
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:03,000
Representative Ames.

2169
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,000
Yeah, thank you.

2170
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:12,000
So on this proposal, I'm fine with the tier two edition, by the way.

2171
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:24,500
But my question relates to the sports books and the change, moving the cap of 10 in terms of numbers of locations in the state.

2172
03:27:24,500 --> 03:27:44,000
Now last year I chaired the subcommittee in this committee that worked on this bill and we worked through quite a number of changes to get to a point where they could get strong support out of our committee.

2173
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:50,500
And one of those changes was this one to put in that cap.

2174
03:27:50,500 --> 03:28:09,000
I don't have a clear memory of the discussion, but it was seen as, I think, a limit on something that we didn't really know here in New Hampshire and we didn't know how it would develop.

2175
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:24,000
And there's, as everybody knows, nervousness about having widespread gambling locations in New Hampshire that's held, that sort of dictates how many people respond to gambling here in New Hampshire.

2176
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:37,500
So we thought setting a cap on the number of locations would be helpful in showing a sort of prudent approach to this new form of gambling.

2177
03:28:37,500 --> 03:28:43,000
And so that limitation of 10 was put into the bill.

2178
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:53,500
And when I represented what the bill did on the floor and in the blurb for the committee, I mentioned it.

2179
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:59,500
And here we are now with only two locations in the state.

2180
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:03,000
And we've got a cap of 10.

2181
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:09,500
And COVID undoubtedly got in the way of working for more than two.

2182
03:29:09,500 --> 03:29:16,000
But I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's too early.

2183
03:29:16,000 --> 03:29:19,000
It seems to me too early.

2184
03:29:19,000 --> 03:29:57,500
Maybe you can respond to this, Charlie, as to why it wouldn't be more, it wouldn't be sort of equally possible in terms of dealing with this limit to deal with it later after we had more experience under our belts, had a better understanding of what a sports book is, what it looks like and how it impacts statewide, whether sort of a lack of any limit is a good thing to go to or not.

2185
03:29:57,500 --> 03:30:01,000
So that's my question to you, Charlie.

2186
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,000
Certainly.

2187
03:30:03,000 --> 03:30:06,500
Representative Ames, thank you for the question.

2188
03:30:06,500 --> 03:30:13,000
Under the current construct, I don't see us hitting above the 10 now.

2189
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:29,000
What would likely to be the case would be is if technology and a revision of our agreement with DraftKings allowed is to have smaller sports book locations, if that makes sense.

2190
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:41,000
Sort of a, you know, you have like a, like a bank has a branch, like we would have branch offices versus the headquarters.

2191
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:48,000
The, there's a limit on the number now because they're so expensive to run.

2192
03:30:48,000 --> 03:31:13,000
But if we were, if draft Kings was, was to reframe how we do it, to have smaller sort of like ATMs have banks, you know, if we had those, like so in sports bars, for example, then we would do that and that would run afoul of the 10.

2193
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:17,500
If that makes sense to your question, Representative Ames.

2194
03:31:17,500 --> 03:31:19,500
Well, thank you.

2195
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:21,500
Representative Southworth.

2196
03:31:21,500 --> 03:31:23,500
Thank you, Mr.

2197
03:31:23,500 --> 03:31:28,000
Chairman, and thank you, Charlie, for taking my question.

2198
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:45,500
Could you say a little more about the safety mechanisms you have for problem gambling, and a little more about how you really know if there is any problem gambling in this type of betting?

2199
03:31:45,500 --> 03:31:47,500
Well, certainly.

2200
03:31:47,500 --> 03:31:50,500
Obviously, it wasn't important to us.

2201
03:31:50,500 --> 03:31:59,500
It's one of the factors which actually was considered in the RFP process originally and scored as well.

2202
03:31:59,500 --> 03:32:03,500
And DraftKings has a robust facility for this.

2203
03:32:03,500 --> 03:32:10,500
And we have betting limits, obviously, on the app as well, and deposits, obviously.

2204
03:32:10,500 --> 03:32:53,000
And we also we also have um we check our director sports betting checks the amount of activity each person has um one of the odd things about sports wagering is that it's a large volume business but it's not a high margin business which means you can bet a lot of money over time and not lose much for example you can you can bet, you know, $500 a week, which seems like a lot would be $25,000 over the course of a year.

2205
03:32:53,000 --> 03:33:01,000
But since you're only losing 7% on average, you're losing about, you know, what is that?

2206
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:10,500
$1,700 over the course of a year, which is, you know, breaking down to, you know, $35 a week.

2207
03:33:10,500 --> 03:33:13,000
So, we do have it.

2208
03:33:13,000 --> 03:33:16,000
We have a process in place.

2209
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:27,000
And I don't know if Danny wants to speak to it or John, additionally, if you guys are on, you can, please.

2210
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:29,000
Sure.

2211
03:33:29,000 --> 03:33:31,000
Can you hear me?

2212
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:33,000
Yes.

2213
03:33:33,000 --> 03:33:35,000
This is John Conforti.

2214
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:40,000
I'm the chief compliance officer for the New Hampshire Lottery.

2215
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:54,500
And just to build out on what Charlie said, we have responsible gaming programs both on the mobile app, on the phone, and also in the physical retail locations.

2216
03:33:54,500 --> 03:34:00,000
A large portion of that is the limits, as Charlie indicated.

2217
03:34:00,000 --> 03:34:02,000
There are self-exclusions.

2218
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:11,000
There are reference pages for help, both nationally and locally, that can get problem gamblers connected with services.

2219
03:34:11,000 --> 03:34:35,500
so that is really baked into the product on the mobile side and also on the retail side as charlie said both for responsible gaming and for risk management purposes we keep it very really baked into the product on the mobile side and also on the retail side.

2220
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:52,500
As Charlie said, both for responsible gaming and for risk management purposes, we keep a very close eye on the wagering activities that take place, the high volume wagering or high dollar number wagering.

2221
03:34:52,500 --> 03:34:57,500
And we're very watchful of that activity along with DraftKings.

2222
03:34:57,500 --> 03:35:02,500
And we identify specifically any I'll see you next time.

2223
03:35:02,500 --> 03:35:07,500
And we're very watchful of that activity along with DraftKings.

2224
03:35:07,500 --> 03:35:14,000
And we identify specifically any concerning behavior and address that as we go.

2225
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:17,500
So there are programs that are operational.

2226
03:35:17,500 --> 03:35:48,000
People have taken advantage both of the limits that are available and the self-exclusion program and that's something that we continuously monitor in fact we just did our first year review and did a review and an update on responsible gambling based on what we learned in the first year so that is something that we're continuously monitoring and improving on.

2227
03:35:48,000 --> 03:35:50,000
Thank you.

2228
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:52,500
Could I do a follow-up?

2229
03:35:52,500 --> 03:35:54,500
Absolutely.

2230
03:35:54,500 --> 03:36:02,000
My question really is, I'm glad you're watchful and that we built those safeguards in.

2231
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:04,500
I remember it very well.

2232
03:36:04,500 --> 03:36:10,000
What I'm not quite hearing though, you're watching and so on.

2233
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:15,000
Have you seen a lot of cases, a few cases?

2234
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:20,500
I really, I want a more, you know, image of that.

2235
03:36:20,500 --> 03:36:27,000
We haven't seen any activity that we have found to be particularly concerning.

2236
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:37,500
We obviously know that with any gaming activity, there's going to be a percentage of people who have struggles with that.

2237
03:36:37,500 --> 03:36:46,500
And what we have seen representative Southworth is that people have taken advantages of self-limiting and self-exclusion policies.

2238
03:36:46,500 --> 03:36:49,000
So those have been adopted.

2239
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:53,000
So people have identified that they've needed help.

2240
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:58,500
They have reached out to the resources here in New Hampshire.

2241
03:36:58,500 --> 03:37:14,500
We've seen some people who have come through that come to the Council for Responsible Gambling through those links, but we haven't seen a particular surge in problem gambling or problematic behavior.

2242
03:37:14,500 --> 03:37:23,500
What we've seen is people utilizing the the tools that we've put in place, we've certainly seen that.

2243
03:37:23,500 --> 03:37:25,500
Thank you.

2244
03:37:25,500 --> 03:37:27,500
That's helpful.

2245
03:37:27,500 --> 03:37:29,500
Representative Tucker.

2246
03:37:29,500 --> 03:37:32,500
Yes, this is a director, Mr.

2247
03:37:32,500 --> 03:37:34,500
McIntyre.

2248
03:37:34,500 --> 03:37:41,000
So I'm sort of intrigued with your concept of branches to larger facilities.

2249
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:45,500
If that's the case that you think that things...

2250
03:37:45,500 --> 03:37:47,500
Representative Tucker?

2251
03:37:47,500 --> 03:37:49,500
Representative Tucker?

2252
03:37:49,500 --> 03:37:51,500
Yes?

2253
03:37:51,500 --> 03:37:53,500
Representative Tucker?

2254
03:37:53,500 --> 03:37:55,500
Yes?

2255
03:37:55,500 --> 03:37:58,000
Can you speak up louder?

2256
03:37:58,000 --> 03:38:00,000
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

2257
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:13,500
I'm interested in the concept of the branches that you spoke of that might make it so that the number 10 should no longer be the cap.

2258
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:31,000
But I wonder why you wouldn't wait until things slim down and trim down that you could have that kind of configuration and possibly less regulation that you believe is quite onerous now and expensive.

2259
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:42,000
Why wouldn't you wait until those things took place to take an interest in coming over, having a cap removed of 10?

2260
03:38:42,000 --> 03:38:46,500
It seems that two is so far from 10.

2261
03:38:46,500 --> 03:38:54,000
I just can't see coming up with no cap when those things haven't happened yet.

2262
03:38:54,000 --> 03:38:56,000
Certainly.

2263
03:38:56,000 --> 03:38:58,500
Thank you for the question.

2264
03:38:58,500 --> 03:39:14,500
I was more explaining how we could run the file of the 10 under the current framework versus saying it's a good idea and then that would be our next business model.

2265
03:39:14,500 --> 03:39:42,500
that was more my suggestion is there are a number of facilities that would like to engage in this type of activity that cannot now because of the economics of it and that if the economics changed we would like to engage in this type of activity that cannot now because of the economics of it.

2266
03:39:42,500 --> 03:39:56,500
And that if the economics changed, we would like to expand into that and wouldn't wanna wait for that to happen, the cap to be lifted, that's all.

2267
03:39:56,500 --> 03:39:59,000
Could I follow up please?

2268
03:39:59,000 --> 03:40:01,000
Follow up?

2269
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
Yes.

2270
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:07,000
Why is that that you wouldn't wanna wait?

2271
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:23,500
I I would think that you'd want to focus in on what the changes were in the industry to make sure that New Hampshire was going in the right direction at that time.

2272
03:40:23,500 --> 03:40:26,000
So, Representative Tucker, thank you.

2273
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:35,000
I certainly view my charge as to responsibly raise as much revenue as the state as I can.

2274
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:37,000
So, I can.

2275
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:51,500
So I try and do that every step of the way and like to take advantage of innovation and technology changes almost as they occur versus sort of waiting.

2276
03:40:51,500 --> 03:41:02,500
I firmly believe that you folks, this big revenue committee really asked me to drive revenue growth for me and my staff.

2277
03:41:02,500 --> 03:41:05,500
And certainly that's what I do.

2278
03:41:05,500 --> 03:41:13,000
And so that's why I frame it that way and sort of respond that way.

2279
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:15,000
Thank you.

2280
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:17,000
Representative Elmi.

2281
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:19,000
Thank you, Mr.

2282
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:21,000
Chairman.

2283
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:26,500
I would like respectively to compare this with tobacco and liquor.

2284
03:41:26,500 --> 03:41:35,500
In excess with liquor and in anything with tobacco, we make considerable amount of revenue off of it.

2285
03:41:35,500 --> 03:41:54,500
But at the expense of the health of our population, and in this case, when there isn't good compliance, and I'm really interested in what John Conforti is saying, it's whether there's been any research on these methods.

2286
03:41:54,500 --> 03:42:03,500
on you can slip into a lot of people creating enormous problems if they do become problem gamblers.

2287
03:42:03,500 --> 03:42:07,500
And so we've got to balance those things.

2288
03:42:07,500 --> 03:42:11,500
And we've always tried to balance those things.

2289
03:42:11,500 --> 03:42:14,500
I'm especially interested in asking Mr.

2290
03:42:14,500 --> 03:42:28,000
Conforti at this point whether it sounds like these systems for finding the problem gamblers and going after them has been developed in a number of places.

2291
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:39,000
and one of the main problems before was that the problem gamblers did not want to acknowledge that and would avoid coming.

2292
03:42:39,000 --> 03:42:41,500
It was kind of self-defining.

2293
03:42:41,500 --> 03:42:51,000
the main problems before was that the problem gamblers did not want to acknowledge that and would avoid coming.

2294
03:42:51,000 --> 03:42:58,000
It was kind of self-defining and they would not come and ask for help.

2295
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:44,500
Has there been research on these yet and to what extent they're effective in getting people to respond to your identification of them thank you representative all me we we have not done uh formal research on that um what we do see is that people are utilizing the tools uh which is very uh good to see um and we have been in contact with the council for Responsible Gambling and very interested in seeing what they are experiencing in terms of the volume of participation or problematic behavior that they've identified.

2296
03:43:44,500 --> 03:43:52,000
And thus far, we haven't seen anything that the council itself has believed is problematic.

2297
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:59,500
Obviously, Representative Almi, we're basing that based on what we know and who comes forward.

2298
03:43:59,500 --> 03:44:13,000
But again, I would say that there's a great emphasis on this, both from the lottery side, but also from the corporate side, from DraftKings as well.

2299
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:15,000
This is a commitment.

2300
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:18,500
It's both the right thing to do.

2301
03:44:18,500 --> 03:44:27,000
It's also in our best interest to make sure that our customers are using the product responsibly.

2302
03:44:27,000 --> 03:44:36,000
No one wants to see stories of people spending money that they don't have on an entertainment product.

2303
03:44:36,000 --> 03:45:00,000
So I guess as my answer would be, we don't have formal studies of those, but we do know that people are utilizing the tools and that we are going to continue to monitor that usage and make sure that we're working with the Council on Responsible Gambling.

2304
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:02,500
They look at our programs.

2305
03:45:02,500 --> 03:45:14,500
They provide us feedback on the best way that we can service problem gamblers and the best way we can reach out to them.

2306
03:45:14,500 --> 03:45:19,500
And we're going to continue that dialogue as we go.

2307
03:45:19,500 --> 03:45:22,000
This is a continuing process.

2308
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:24,000
Thank you.

2309
03:45:24,000 --> 03:45:27,500
Could I clarify the question a bit?

2310
03:45:27,500 --> 03:45:45,500
I was asking, I figured you hadn't been doing this for long enough, but I was asking if in other states or other countries there had been study of these particular mechanisms for controlling the problem.

2311
03:45:45,500 --> 03:45:48,000
Representative Almey, it's Charlie McIntyre.

2312
03:45:48,000 --> 03:46:08,000
If I could, I can probably do you one better in the sense of a significant number of our players come from Massachusetts on the mobile side, and the majority of our players come from Massachusetts on the retail side.

2313
03:46:08,000 --> 03:46:30,500
and I can ask the council from Massachusetts, Marlene Warner, who I know quite well, to ask us for data she may have on their players on sports betting, because they'd either be doing it in New Hampshire or Rhode Island, if that makes sense.

2314
03:46:30,500 --> 03:46:32,500
That is true.

2315
03:46:32,500 --> 03:46:38,000
They are doing research on the bad effects side of things.

2316
03:46:38,000 --> 03:46:40,500
So that would be great.

2317
03:46:40,500 --> 03:46:42,500
Thank you.

2318
03:46:42,500 --> 03:46:44,500
Yes.

2319
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:46,500
Representative Murphy.

2320
03:46:46,500 --> 03:46:48,500
Thank you.

2321
03:46:48,500 --> 03:46:50,500
Yes.

2322
03:46:50,500 --> 03:46:52,500
Representative Murphy.

2323
03:46:52,500 --> 03:46:54,500
Thank you, Mr.

2324
03:46:54,500 --> 03:46:56,500
Chairman.

2325
03:46:56,500 --> 03:47:13,500
My question is not being that familiar with gambling and the question that was brought up about ATMs by Charlie, that concept intrigued me in the sense of the pertinence of the 10 cap.

2326
03:47:13,500 --> 03:47:26,000
So my question is, is there a limit to the size of either volume or size of the building that triggers you into that 10?

2327
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:39,500
Or is it you just want to open up a small retail spot anywhere in the state and that qualifies as inclusion to that group of 10?

2328
03:47:39,500 --> 03:47:43,500
Currently now, Representative, thank you for the question.

2329
03:47:43,500 --> 03:47:51,000
Currently now, it's really an economic discussion in terms of the cost of doing it.

2330
03:47:51,000 --> 03:48:15,000
And I use the ATM as just an example, but certainly if, for example, you had a sports bar that would want to do this in a real meaningful way, it would be an additional benefit to the business as well as us and in an adult-controlled environment.

2331
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:27,000
And certainly, if we could configure it in a way with DraftKings to do that, that would probably be beneficial to all parties involved.

2332
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:30,000
That's why I use the example.

2333
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:36,500
Like I said, I'm just trying to make sure we drive revenue growth.

2334
03:48:36,500 --> 03:48:41,000
And that's certainly, I believe, my charge, our charge.

2335
03:48:41,000 --> 03:48:53,500
So follow up on that, if DraftKings wanted to open up a small couple of machines in my cellar, would that qualify as another location?

2336
03:48:53,500 --> 03:48:55,500
No, no, no.

2337
03:48:55,500 --> 03:49:01,500
It would certainly depend on your cellar first and the controls involved.

2338
03:49:01,500 --> 03:49:10,000
but certainly it's a discussion between DraftKings and us and the third party we're doing business with.

2339
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:16,000
And that's obviously to drive revenue growth and also do it responsibly.

2340
03:49:16,000 --> 03:49:22,000
So it's more than just sort of a maximum number of locations.

2341
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:30,500
It's more the correct, the ones that we believe benefit the state as well as the businesses.

2342
03:49:30,500 --> 03:49:32,500
Thank you.

2343
03:49:32,500 --> 03:49:34,500
Representative Abrami.

2344
03:49:34,500 --> 03:49:43,500
Yeah, I kind of want to rephrase what I was asking before making a statement as well here.

2345
03:49:43,500 --> 03:49:54,500
I want to pose a hypothesis that having the 10 limit removed could actually be a disincentive for others to jump in.

2346
03:49:54,500 --> 03:49:57,000
Why do I say that?

2347
03:49:57,000 --> 03:50:03,000
Again, there's a risk and expense to opening a sports book location.

2348
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:11,000
And there's only so many people that actually are going to avail themselves to these locations.

2349
03:50:11,000 --> 03:50:26,500
So if I'm a business kind of guy and I want to open a book, now you're going to find out that there could be 50 of these around the state.

2350
03:50:26,500 --> 03:50:42,000
You know, I may have second thoughts about wanting to open one because we're taking the potential customers are being spread across, you know, 40 other locations that didn't exist before.

2351
03:50:42,000 --> 03:50:48,500
So I just think we've got to be a little careful about this.

2352
03:50:48,500 --> 03:50:50,500
Something to think about.

2353
03:50:50,500 --> 03:50:57,500
I don't know if Charlie, you want to react to what I just said.

2354
03:50:57,500 --> 03:51:19,000
I'm just thinking if I was thinking about getting into this business, and if it's limited to 10, okay, someone's going to do the math and say, okay, these many people are going to probably bet, and this is probably worth my while.

2355
03:51:19,000 --> 03:51:26,000
But if we're going to spread that across 50 locations, that's a different model.

2356
03:51:26,000 --> 03:51:29,000
That's a different discussion, I think.

2357
03:51:29,000 --> 03:51:31,000
Yeah.

2358
03:51:31,000 --> 03:51:44,500
To your questions, Representative Ibrami, if you're looking for smaller locations where there's less regulation, you're likely to be less risk tolerant there, if that makes sense.

2359
03:51:44,500 --> 03:52:23,000
Like ATMs have a limit on how much cash you can get but a teller doesn't same idea so like i said this is just speculation in the sense of what the next step would be i was just really trying to explain how we could run afoul of the 10 if indeed we were to um but yes if there were 20 locations in manchester versus, there'd be less incentive to do it because it's expensive.

2360
03:52:23,000 --> 03:52:31,500
But certainly, the market is dictating now that it looks like it does and will grow slowly.

2361
03:52:31,500 --> 03:52:40,500
You know, my sense is even with the 10, there's, I think within the 10, there's a market.

2362
03:52:40,500 --> 03:52:43,000
I understand about free market.

2363
03:52:43,000 --> 03:52:46,000
I agree 100% about free markets.

2364
03:52:46,000 --> 03:53:12,000
But I have a feeling that I don't think you're going to see more than 10, unless we change the rules here somehow, people jumping in, but to open it up to more than 10, I don't know, I think there might be this incentive to some businesses thinking about getting in.

2365
03:53:12,000 --> 03:53:14,000
That's all, thank you.

2366
03:53:14,000 --> 03:53:16,000
Of course.

2367
03:53:16,000 --> 03:53:18,500
Any other comments or questions?

2368
03:53:18,500 --> 03:53:20,500
Representative Elliott.

2369
03:53:20,500 --> 03:53:22,500
Mr.

2370
03:53:22,500 --> 03:53:27,000
Chairman, Representative Ames had his hand up also first.

2371
03:53:27,000 --> 03:53:33,000
Representative Elliott, when you hold off until Representative Ames asks his question.

2372
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:35,000
Representative Ames.

2373
03:53:35,000 --> 03:53:41,500
Actually, I'm guessing that I came in after Representative Elliott, but I'll go.

2374
03:53:41,500 --> 03:54:01,000
So my question to Charlie McIntyre is, could you provide the committee with the description of the two sports books, locations, the retail operations that are set up now and operating in terms of size and activity and investment?

2375
03:54:01,000 --> 03:54:07,500
Any information that details and enables us to understand what's in place now.

2376
03:54:07,500 --> 03:54:19,000
The way I read the statute, I was just looking at the statute, there's very little definition of this concept in the statute.

2377
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:28,500
It says the commission and its agents are authorized to operate physical sports book retail locations within the state.

2378
03:54:28,500 --> 03:54:34,000
This is the section of the statute that this bill amends.

2379
03:54:34,000 --> 03:54:41,500
And so it sounds like these operations are operated by the commission and its agents.

2380
03:54:41,500 --> 03:54:46,000
And I guess that's another part of my question.

2381
03:54:46,000 --> 03:54:53,500
Tell us how they're operated and what the lottery's involvement is in this as well.

2382
03:54:53,500 --> 03:54:59,000
Could you provide us with detailed information on the existing locations?

2383
03:54:59,000 --> 03:55:02,000
Sure, I'll certainly answer the question.

2384
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:08,500
And if this follow-up, I'll happy to respond in writing thereafter, Representative Ames.

2385
03:55:08,500 --> 03:55:46,000
Yeah, that's what I was looking I was looking for yeah there's two facilities right now one in Seabrook and one in Manchester they're actually quite different in terms of construct the one in Seabrook they built what you would characterize as a stadium level seating leather couches hundreds of sports tvs they refurbished the Seabrook dog track and took one of the grandstands that was inside and made it into a theater type environment.

2386
03:55:46,000 --> 03:55:49,000
Very high end leather, all fitted.

2387
03:55:49,000 --> 03:55:56,500
They're at the very bottom of the stairs, which you would walk down a grandstand.

2388
03:55:56,500 --> 03:56:03,500
There are people who write tickets for you and you can watch games there.

2389
03:56:03,500 --> 03:56:38,000
You can also obviously bet on horse racing because they're the last facility with a horse racing license uh and they spent i don't know how much but i'm guessing it was in excess of a million dollars refurbishing that facility um they probably will do in excess of 50 million dollars in sports betting handle for the year they receive a percentage of the profit from that activity.

2390
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:40,500
And that varies by week.

2391
03:56:40,500 --> 03:56:43,500
That's what we call a hold.

2392
03:56:43,500 --> 03:56:47,500
And that varies between six to 12%, say.

2393
03:56:47,500 --> 03:56:51,000
Averages around seven, seven and a half.

2394
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:55,000
It's been a little better than that recently.

2395
03:56:55,000 --> 03:56:57,500
We've had some good weeks.

2396
03:56:57,500 --> 03:57:00,000
And so that's that facility.

2397
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:03,500
It also is a charitable gambling hall.

2398
03:57:03,500 --> 03:57:06,500
So there's that function as well.

2399
03:57:06,500 --> 03:57:12,000
It's in a separate area from where the sports book is.

2400
03:57:12,000 --> 03:57:19,500
And the employees who write tickets, who actually take the wagers are employees of Seabrook.

2401
03:57:19,500 --> 03:57:24,000
There are the facility in Manchester is significantly smaller.

2402
03:57:24,000 --> 03:57:40,500
It's really next, it's in a shared space, but with a separate wall from what is a Greek restaurant and charitable gambling is also in a separate space in that facility as well.

2403
03:57:40,500 --> 03:57:43,000
Um, they have great food.

2404
03:57:43,000 --> 03:57:49,000
They sort of, um, focus on hospitality, food and beverages as well.

2405
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:53,000
Uh, it's a smaller physical facility, much smaller.

2406
03:57:53,000 --> 03:57:57,500
It has a number of sports TVs running simultaneously.

2407
03:57:57,500 --> 03:58:07,000
And that facility will probably be in around $20 to $25 million in handle for this current fiscal year.

2408
03:58:07,000 --> 03:58:11,500
And like I said, their writers are their employees.

2409
03:58:11,500 --> 03:58:26,000
DraftKings has an employee dedicated to New Hampshire who does management of the retail sports book, who can make sure all their regulations and contract requirements are complied with.

2410
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:37,000
And those two facilities in a nutshell are representative Ames aims and I can certainly go further in detail if you want.

2411
03:58:37,000 --> 03:59:03,500
Okay, I guess there is this question when I look at the statute it talks about the Commission and its agents as the entities that are authorized to operate these sports books so is that how do you how do you square that with what you just described who's operating these sports books.

2412
03:59:03,500 --> 03:59:11,500
So is that, how do you, how do you square that with what you just described?

2413
03:59:11,500 --> 03:59:14,000
Who's operating these sports books?

2414
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:16,500
So it's pursuant to contract.

2415
03:59:16,500 --> 03:59:19,500
We have a contract with DraftKings.

2416
03:59:19,500 --> 03:59:27,500
And so DraftKings is our agent and they contract with subcontractors of who the facility is.

2417
03:59:27,500 --> 03:59:30,500
And they're held to that standard.

2418
03:59:30,500 --> 03:59:40,000
DraftKings has, I think, 11 similar arrangements around the country with different states, Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, et cetera.

2419
03:59:40,000 --> 03:59:42,000
Okay.

2420
03:59:42,000 --> 03:59:44,000
All right.

2421
03:59:44,000 --> 03:59:46,000
Thank you.

2422
03:59:46,000 --> 03:59:48,000
Representative Elliott.

2423
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:50,000
Representative Elliott.

2424
03:59:50,000 --> 03:59:52,000
You're muted.

2425
03:59:52,000 --> 03:59:54,500
Can you hear me now?

2426
03:59:54,500 --> 03:59:56,500
Yes.

2427
03:59:56,500 --> 04:00:12,500
I have a question for Charles because the last time I saw him was about three weeks ago in front of the lavery building when I was cashing in a winning ticket.

2428
04:00:12,500 --> 04:00:14,500
So thank you, Charles.

2429
04:00:14,500 --> 04:00:22,000
Now, my question to you is, how long has this sports book been in operation?

2430
04:00:22,000 --> 04:00:25,500
Has it been five years, 10 years?

2431
04:00:25,500 --> 04:00:27,500
Just the fall.

2432
04:00:27,500 --> 04:00:29,500
We started in September.

2433
04:00:29,500 --> 04:00:34,000
We were supposed to open March 18th, I believe.

2434
04:00:34,000 --> 04:00:40,500
And then COVID hit and they closed the facilities obviously out of safety.

2435
04:00:40,500 --> 04:00:46,000
So they've been open since the fall, since September, I believe.

2436
04:00:46,000 --> 04:00:48,500
Oh, no, sorry, since August.

2437
04:00:48,500 --> 04:00:50,500
Since August.

2438
04:00:50,500 --> 04:00:52,500
Okay.

2439
04:00:52,500 --> 04:01:34,000
Well, the reason I asked that question, and I thought it was longer than that, but now I realize it wasn't, but I I agree with Representative Abrami that to take out that line that no more than 10 sports books should be in operation at any given time makes me wonder if it took us this long just to get two books that are open, why do we need to jump right away into 10 or more locations or eliminate that altogether?

2440
04:01:34,000 --> 04:01:36,500
Do you understand the question?

2441
04:01:36,500 --> 04:01:38,500
I do.

2442
04:01:38,500 --> 04:01:51,000
I don't know if it's a question for me so much as, you know, I don't know that we'd run afoul of 10 anytime soon.

2443
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:59,500
It would be more, it would limit us in terms of expansion and sort of technology growth.

2444
04:01:59,500 --> 04:02:04,500
So another representative Lang-Wan has answered the question as well.

2445
04:02:04,500 --> 04:02:06,500
Thank you Mr.

2446
04:02:06,500 --> 04:02:08,500
Chair.

2447
04:02:08,500 --> 04:02:11,500
Charlie, what is your title now?

2448
04:02:11,500 --> 04:02:13,500
Commissioner or Director?

2449
04:02:13,500 --> 04:02:15,500
I forget.

2450
04:02:15,500 --> 04:02:19,500
I'm the Executive Director of the Hampshire Lottery.

2451
04:02:19,500 --> 04:02:25,500
I answer to a commission which acts like a board of directors.

2452
04:02:25,500 --> 04:02:27,500
They're part-time.

2453
04:02:27,500 --> 04:02:32,000
It's very much of a, I'm essentially Chief Executive.

2454
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:39,500
I think that my counterpart closest would be Fish and Game executive director as well.

2455
04:02:39,500 --> 04:02:41,500
Fish and game commission.

2456
04:02:41,500 --> 04:02:43,500
Yeah.

2457
04:02:43,500 --> 04:02:51,500
This legislation, from your point of view, it sets a limit, but it's basically enabling legislation.

2458
04:02:51,500 --> 04:03:03,000
And if something decides to, or someone or some entity decides to open one of these things, they're the ones making the risk.

2459
04:03:03,000 --> 04:03:07,000
They either live or fail by their operation.

2460
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:13,500
And you really don't care other than making money for the state, right?

2461
04:03:13,500 --> 04:03:15,500
Well, I do.

2462
04:03:15,500 --> 04:03:17,500
I care, obviously.

2463
04:03:17,500 --> 04:03:21,000
I want our partners to make money.

2464
04:03:21,000 --> 04:03:24,000
I'm very much an avowed capitalist.

2465
04:03:24,000 --> 04:03:32,000
And so I want them to do well, because if they do well, we do well.

2466
04:03:32,000 --> 04:03:38,500
Obviously, if they don't do well, it looks the facility will look downtrodden.

2467
04:03:38,500 --> 04:03:42,000
The customer will have a good experience.

2468
04:03:42,000 --> 04:03:44,000
All those good things.

2469
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:50,500
Yeah, but it's not it's not like you're you're pushing this for you.

2470
04:03:50,500 --> 04:03:57,500
You're pushing this to allow an entity to succeed on their own merits, correct?

2471
04:03:57,500 --> 04:04:00,000
Yeah, I mean, honestly, yes.

2472
04:04:00,000 --> 04:04:04,000
Okay, we said this is Pat, Representative Ramia.

2473
04:04:04,000 --> 04:04:11,500
Representative Major, you going to step away a second, so I took the chair over.

2474
04:04:11,500 --> 04:04:14,000
Any follow-up, Jordan, you said?

2475
04:04:14,000 --> 04:04:16,000
No, I'm all set.

2476
04:04:16,000 --> 04:04:19,500
Okay, Representative Lang has his hand up.

2477
04:04:19,500 --> 04:04:27,500
I was just going to answer the question about locations and why we're moving this forward.

2478
04:04:27,500 --> 04:04:42,000
So one thing I do want to remind the task for the committee is that, you know, I served on the serve still on the governor's reopening task force.

2479
04:04:42,000 --> 04:04:47,000
And in phase one, all charitable gaming was shut down.

2480
04:04:47,000 --> 04:04:52,000
And so there was no charitable gaming happening at all.

2481
04:04:52,000 --> 04:05:20,500
So any chance for any business to open to do this kind of thing was shut down until as Charlie said, I believe it was August before I actually wrote the charitable gaming guidance for the reopening task force that the governor implemented so that they could reopen their businesses in a safe way and do it.

2482
04:05:20,500 --> 04:05:25,000
But there were still limits put on those businesses.

2483
04:05:25,000 --> 04:05:29,000
So even now, businesses have restrictions on them.

2484
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:49,500
So the reason we're not seeing licenses move forward is because we're under these COVID restrictions that nobody wants to take the financial risk when the fact that you've got these restrictions put on them until unknown future at this point.

2485
04:05:49,500 --> 04:06:02,500
Again, and to Charlie's point about ATMs, if we're talking about the language in the bill, it says no more than 10 sports book retail locations.

2486
04:06:02,500 --> 04:06:19,500
So if Charlie and Charlie's vision of if the case at the Brook in Seabrook wanted to work with Loon Mountain to open up a satellite office, that would be considered a second location.

2487
04:06:19,500 --> 04:06:24,000
It's a second physical location of that sports book.

2488
04:06:24,000 --> 04:06:45,500
and so it would run afoul, even though we have only one licensee in that we would have the Brook as the charitable gaming operation, that would run afoul of the locations and that would classify, they would be using two locations up.

2489
04:06:45,500 --> 04:06:51,500
So again, the goal behind this bill was not to artificially limit.

2490
04:06:51,500 --> 04:07:32,500
I i don't anticipate we'll get to 10 any any rush but i also don't want to be pushing up against 10 and then waiting for the legislature to act so we can move um you know charlie is a phenomenal manager um he's done great great work with the sports book and i trust him to allow the businesses to open and and make sure they're profitable because if they're not profitable they're not going to be good for the state.

2491
04:07:32,500 --> 04:07:37,500
So he's not going to allow those businesses to open.

2492
04:07:37,500 --> 04:08:07,500
I am concerned to Greg Moore's comment of the medallions in New York is that if you limit this to 10, you know darn well that those, and we want to expand it in the future, those 10 locations are going to come in screaming they don't want it increased because they don't want to give up their market share.

2493
04:08:07,500 --> 04:08:15,000
And so, you know, I don't think it's the state's business to limit market share.

2494
04:08:15,000 --> 04:08:23,000
It's the retail operations choice to do a return on an investment, see if it works.

2495
04:08:23,000 --> 04:08:26,500
And if it does, then they open.

2496
04:08:26,500 --> 04:08:29,500
If it doesn't, then they don't.

2497
04:08:29,500 --> 04:08:39,500
It's Charlie's job to make sure that the state's risk is minimized as much as possible and we make revenue.

2498
04:08:39,500 --> 04:08:44,500
So I am concerned about the locations coming, going forward.

2499
04:08:44,500 --> 04:08:57,500
I want to see free market work if it, if it needs to, if New Hampshire goes that way, but I thank you for your testimony.

2500
04:08:57,500 --> 04:09:00,000
I know we've run over.

2501
04:09:00,000 --> 04:09:02,000
Okay.

2502
04:09:02,000 --> 04:09:04,500
Any more questions or comments?

2503
04:09:04,500 --> 04:09:11,000
Seeing none, I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 330.

2504
04:09:11,000 --> 04:09:13,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

2505
04:09:13,000 --> 04:09:20,500
on house bill 330, there were on the blue sheet, Tony Leacus, elected official, support.

2506
04:09:20,500 --> 04:09:23,000
Alyssa Leacus, elected official, support.

2507
04:09:23,000 --> 04:09:26,500
Eric Rothbund, member of the public, support.

2508
04:09:26,500 --> 04:09:30,000
Eric Rothman, member of the public support.

2509
04:09:30,000 --> 04:09:34,500
And Alexandria Meninawa in support, member of the public.

2510
04:09:34,500 --> 04:09:36,500
That's the blue sheet.

2511
04:09:36,500 --> 04:09:47,000
I'm going to open the public hearing on House Bill 354, an act relative to the local option for sports betting.

2512
04:09:47,000 --> 04:09:50,500
We've had a lot of betting today.

2513
04:09:50,500 --> 04:09:54,000
And the prime sponsor is Representative Lang.

2514
04:09:54,000 --> 04:10:05,500
He's going to introduce the bill and there is nobody else testifying for it except there's a blue sheet support from Eric Rothbard.

2515
04:10:05,500 --> 04:10:07,500
Thank you, Mr.

2516
04:10:07,500 --> 04:10:09,500
Chair.

2517
04:10:09,500 --> 04:10:15,500
Thank you, committee, for again taking my testimony on House Bill 354.

2518
04:10:15,500 --> 04:10:18,000
This is a simple bill.

2519
04:10:18,000 --> 04:10:43,500
What I realized as I passed House, when House Bill 480 passed, which legalized sports gaming, and I saw the first ballot that contained the language that needed to go on the ballot in order for an municipality or a town to authorize sports betting, I realized that was horrific language.

2520
04:10:43,500 --> 04:10:45,500
It was terrible.

2521
04:10:45,500 --> 04:10:55,000
And I don't know how I let the bill get through the house that way without recommending a change.

2522
04:10:55,000 --> 04:11:10,000
The original language makes it sound like the town or city might somehow be liable for a sports retail book and like the town was going to become a bookie.

2523
04:11:10,000 --> 04:11:21,000
And so this bill just cleans up the language that goes on a ballot to make it more understandable to the voter.

2524
04:11:21,000 --> 04:11:31,000
The original language said, shall we allow sport operating book retail locations within whatever the town is, town of Samerton?

2525
04:11:31,000 --> 04:11:49,500
The new language cleans it up and it says, shall the city, shall the town of San Bernardin allow the operation of sports retail books within the city of town, or within the town of San Bernardin?

2526
04:11:49,500 --> 04:11:56,500
So I think it's just a housekeeping bill that just cleans up the language.

2527
04:11:56,500 --> 04:12:14,500
Like I said, I was down in New York City speaking on sports betting, and I think Charlie was there as well, and I saw the first ballot that I think the city of Franklin had.

2528
04:12:14,500 --> 04:12:19,500
And I was like, wow, that was really bad language.

2529
04:12:19,500 --> 04:12:26,000
We could have cleaned that up to make it easier for the voter.

2530
04:12:26,000 --> 04:12:36,500
And that's all this bill does is it cleans up the language to make a little more cleaner for the voter.

2531
04:12:36,500 --> 04:12:41,000
And I did work with Charlie in this language.

2532
04:12:41,000 --> 04:12:43,500
Any questions of Representative Lange?

2533
04:12:43,500 --> 04:12:45,500
Mr.

2534
04:12:45,500 --> 04:12:47,500
Chairman?

2535
04:12:47,500 --> 04:12:49,500
Representative Almey.

2536
04:12:49,500 --> 04:12:56,500
How did the previous language imply liability by the town and this one doesn't?

2537
04:12:56,500 --> 04:12:58,500
I don't quite understand.

2538
04:12:58,500 --> 04:13:01,000
They seem just about equivalent.

2539
04:13:01,000 --> 04:13:03,000
They are.

2540
04:13:03,000 --> 04:13:05,500
Again, they are fairly equivalent.

2541
04:13:05,500 --> 04:13:18,000
Again, it was my take on the read and I talked to Charlie as well and he thought it could be a little bit cleaner.

2542
04:13:18,000 --> 04:13:21,000
Again, I guess it's just personal.

2543
04:13:21,000 --> 04:14:00,000
As I read that when I in in new york and i read that first that ballot question on the city of franklin's ballot uh who did pass it by the way um it it just was cumbersome and i i also heard the same comments from people in the city of concord that there was actually letters to the editor that that um implied that the city was going to be somehow liable as a sports book.

2544
04:14:00,000 --> 04:14:04,000
And I just thought it was ugly language.

2545
04:14:04,000 --> 04:15:01,500
And I was trying to clean up the language to make it clear that the only thing that city and town is authorizing is a business opportunity for the city or town, that the town has no liability, whether or not they want to allow that type of business opportunity within their confines.ines um so again i i worked with charlie on this and it was we thought that this helped the voter get a little bit more clarity representative bronney representative lion thank you um i don't have any heartburn on this one this is fine uh do you know how many how many uh towns and cities have approved so far All right.

2546
04:15:01,500 --> 04:15:05,500
I don't have any heartburn on this one.

2547
04:15:05,500 --> 04:15:07,500
This is fine.

2548
04:15:07,500 --> 04:15:13,500
Do you know how many towns and cities have approved so far?

2549
04:15:13,500 --> 04:15:20,000
If I remember right, nine have, and Charlie may have a better number.

2550
04:15:20,000 --> 04:15:26,000
I think it was on 10 ballots and nine of them passed.

2551
04:15:26,000 --> 04:15:28,500
Actually, two of them failed.

2552
04:15:28,500 --> 04:15:33,000
Maybe it's 11 ballots and nine of them passed.

2553
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:37,500
I think the city of Concord voted it down.

2554
04:15:37,500 --> 04:15:39,500
I can't remember.

2555
04:15:39,500 --> 04:15:41,500
No, they voted down.

2556
04:15:41,500 --> 04:15:43,500
Concord voted down something.

2557
04:15:43,500 --> 04:15:51,000
And then the second one was, I think it was Nashville, voted it down again.

2558
04:15:51,000 --> 04:15:55,500
And we heard some language around that as well.

2559
04:15:55,500 --> 04:16:10,000
The previous bill, you heard at one o'clock, why they wanted to have it repeated because I think it was unclear to the voter what they were voting on.

2560
04:16:10,000 --> 04:16:13,000
Can I ask Charlie a question?

2561
04:16:13,000 --> 04:16:15,000
Follow up.

2562
04:16:15,000 --> 04:16:20,500
Okay, Charlie, can you elaborate a little bit more on that?

2563
04:16:20,500 --> 04:16:24,500
Let's do which towns passed the sports book.

2564
04:16:24,500 --> 04:16:27,500
Representative Abrami, this is John Conforte.

2565
04:16:27,500 --> 04:16:37,500
Charlie had a meeting at 2.30 that he had to attend, so he's asked me to sit in for him.

2566
04:16:37,500 --> 04:16:48,500
That's fine.by, I think representative Lang, I think the numbers are correct with regard to the cities that first voted in November.

2567
04:16:48,500 --> 04:16:56,500
We then had a round of towns in last March, which also voted on the question.

2568
04:16:56,500 --> 04:17:12,000
I don't have the exact number of towns and municipalities, but I think about the success rate was about three quarters of the towns or cities who voted on the question.

2569
04:17:12,000 --> 04:17:21,500
Not everyone put it on their ballot, but I can certainly follow up with an exact number for you.

2570
04:17:21,500 --> 04:17:36,500
Yes, that would be great if you could maybe just give us the list of the towns that voted and the list of towns that successfully voted and voted down.

2571
04:17:36,500 --> 04:17:40,000
We can certainly do that for you.

2572
04:17:40,000 --> 04:17:42,000
Chair, thank you.

2573
04:17:42,000 --> 04:17:45,500
Hey Charlie, I mean I'm sorry, Pat.

2574
04:17:45,500 --> 04:17:47,500
Yeah.

2575
04:17:47,500 --> 04:18:03,500
Representative Ramey, I can tell you that in March there were 15 towns scheduled to, including Belmont, Derry, Hampton, Hinsdale, Hudson, Lincoln, Littleton, Milford, Newmarket, Pelham, Pembroke, Salem, Seabrook, Swansea, and Woodstock.

2576
04:18:03,500 --> 04:18:17,000
I don't know how many of those passed, but there were 15 of them that put it on the March ballot last year, after the November ballot.

2577
04:18:17,000 --> 04:18:19,000
Yeah, Representative Lange.

2578
04:18:19,000 --> 04:18:21,000
Yes.

2579
04:18:21,000 --> 04:18:23,000
That's great.

2580
04:18:23,000 --> 04:18:29,500
But if they can still provide that list, I can't write that fast.

2581
04:18:29,500 --> 04:18:40,500
And it'd be interesting to plot those on our map to get a sense of the locations that we can do here.

2582
04:18:40,500 --> 04:18:48,000
I think the goal is to spread it across the state as best we can.

2583
04:18:48,000 --> 04:18:50,000
So thank you.

2584
04:18:50,000 --> 04:18:57,000
I do think that question does go back to the number of locations, right?

2585
04:18:57,000 --> 04:19:00,000
So we just had 15 towns.

2586
04:19:00,000 --> 04:19:10,000
Plus we know there were nine cities before that is 24 potentials there that are looking for retail sports books.

2587
04:19:10,000 --> 04:19:12,000
Thank you.

2588
04:19:12,000 --> 04:19:14,000
Further questions or comments?

2589
04:19:14,000 --> 04:19:16,000
Representative Elliott.

2590
04:19:16,000 --> 04:19:18,000
Can you hear me?

2591
04:19:18,000 --> 04:19:20,000
Yes.

2592
04:19:20,000 --> 04:19:27,000
Okay, my question is to Representative Lange, who said, quote, there's no liability, unquote.

2593
04:19:27,000 --> 04:19:33,000
I would like to know the source of that statement, Representative Lang.

2594
04:19:33,000 --> 04:19:36,000
Did you go to a lawyer?

2595
04:19:36,000 --> 04:19:40,500
So if your question is liability to the town?

2596
04:19:40,500 --> 04:19:42,500
Yes.

2597
04:19:42,500 --> 04:19:56,000
If that is your question, then the answer is within the contract that I'm sorry, I almost said fish and game because that's where I sit now.

2598
04:19:56,000 --> 04:20:01,000
the lottery commission signed that the lottery commission when it.

2599
04:20:01,000 --> 04:20:08,000
I'm sorry, I almost said fish and game because that's where I sit now.

2600
04:20:08,000 --> 04:20:21,000
The Lottery Commission signed that the Lottery Commission, when the contract that it has with DraftKings doesn't incur any liability to the local towns at all.

2601
04:20:21,000 --> 04:20:29,000
The liability is with the business owner himself and with DraftKings, and they share that liability.

2602
04:20:29,000 --> 04:20:31,000
Thank you.

2603
04:20:31,000 --> 04:20:33,000
Representative Tucker.

2604
04:20:33,000 --> 04:20:46,500
Yes, I had a question of one of the things that makes sports betting and betting generally different than other topics is that there already was betting.

2605
04:20:46,500 --> 04:20:49,000
It just wasn't legal betting.

2606
04:20:49,000 --> 04:21:02,000
and do we believe that having it now legal and the state able to participate in getting some revenue has reduced the amount of illegal betting?

2607
04:21:02,000 --> 04:21:04,500
Or do we not know?

2608
04:21:04,500 --> 04:21:18,000
Well, I can only speak anecdotally, because I do know some people that were betting were betting on games beforehand and that now use the DraftKings app.

2609
04:21:18,000 --> 04:21:33,000
So I can't give you any kind of statistics or numbers, but I can tell you that I know at least two people that are now using the DraftKings app.

2610
04:21:33,000 --> 04:21:35,000
Maybe.

2611
04:21:35,000 --> 04:21:37,000
James.

2612
04:21:37,000 --> 04:21:39,000
James.

2613
04:21:39,000 --> 04:21:41,000
James.

2614
04:21:41,000 --> 04:21:43,000
James.

2615
04:21:43,000 --> 04:21:45,000
James.

2616
04:21:45,000 --> 04:21:47,000
James.

2617
04:21:47,000 --> 04:21:49,000
James.

2618
04:21:49,000 --> 04:21:51,000
James.

2619
04:21:51,000 --> 04:21:53,000
James.

2620
04:21:53,000 --> 04:21:55,000
James.

2621
04:21:55,000 --> 04:21:57,000
James.

2622
04:21:57,000 --> 04:21:59,000
James.

2623
04:21:59,000 --> 04:22:01,000
James.

2624
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:03,000
James.

2625
04:22:03,000 --> 04:22:05,000
James.

2626
04:22:05,000 --> 04:22:07,000
James.

2627
04:22:07,000 --> 04:22:09,000
James.

2628
04:22:09,000 --> 04:22:11,000
James.

2629
04:22:11,000 --> 04:22:13,000
James.

2630
04:22:13,000 --> 04:22:15,000
James.

2631
04:22:15,000 --> 04:22:17,000
James.

2632
04:22:17,000 --> 04:22:19,000
James.

2633
04:22:19,000 --> 04:22:21,000
James.

2634
04:22:21,000 --> 04:22:23,000
James.

2635
04:22:23,000 --> 04:22:25,000
James.

2636
04:22:25,000 --> 04:22:27,000
James.

2637
04:22:27,000 --> 04:22:29,000
James.

2638
04:22:29,000 --> 04:22:31,000
James.

2639
04:22:31,000 --> 04:22:33,000
James.

2640
04:22:33,000 --> 04:22:35,000
James.

2641
04:22:35,000 --> 04:22:41,500
to the contracts that the lottery has that enable the sports book locations.

2642
04:22:41,500 --> 04:22:46,000
And they were mentioned by Director McIntyre as well.

2643
04:22:46,000 --> 04:22:57,500
And I had previously asked for details about each of the locations, but I didn't ask for the contracts that have authorized those.

2644
04:22:57,500 --> 04:23:26,500
So I'd like to add that to that request that uh we provide be provided we in the committee with the information about the sports book locations including the contracts that authorize their um that activity certainly representative ames we can provide that and just for the sake of clarity the state has only one contract with DraftKings.

2645
04:23:26,500 --> 04:23:30,000
DraftKings then subcontracts with those individual locations.

2646
04:23:30,000 --> 04:23:50,500
And just to put a little bit of a finer point on the previous testimony, in terms of the breakdown of responsibilities, DraftKings operates the technical aspects of the sportsbook in terms of the technology, the platform for taking the wagers.

2647
04:23:50,500 --> 04:23:52,500
And then the...

2648
04:23:52,500 --> 04:24:02,500
Kings operates the technical aspects of the sports book in terms of the technology, the platform for taking the wagers.

2649
04:24:02,500 --> 04:24:15,000
And then the location is responsible for the, the personnel to run the sports book and obviously for cash handling practices in the book itself.

2650
04:24:15,000 --> 04:24:27,500
But we would be happy to send you a breakdown of those division of responsibilities and certainly the contract that, that we have with DraftKings.

2651
04:24:27,500 --> 04:24:29,500
Thank you, Mr.

2652
04:24:29,500 --> 04:24:31,500
Chairman.

2653
04:24:31,500 --> 04:24:36,000
I'm just doing this on behalf of Representative Tucker.

2654
04:24:36,000 --> 04:24:42,000
She hadn't had her question answered yet by the lottery department commission.

2655
04:24:42,000 --> 04:24:55,000
And I think she'd like to know if they've got any data on whether the illegal gambling on sports betting has declined since these two started.

2656
04:24:55,000 --> 04:24:58,500
Thank you, Representative Almi and Representative Tucker.

2657
04:24:58,500 --> 04:25:02,500
I'd be happy to attempt to answer that.

2658
04:25:02,500 --> 04:25:15,000
I think what we've heard anecdotally is that there's been a transition from people who were betting illegally onto the DraftKings New Hampshire lottery platform.

2659
04:25:15,000 --> 04:25:29,000
The other thing that we're seeing as more states are adopting legal wagering that we are seeing a softening in the illegal market, the offshore market that existed.

2660
04:25:29,000 --> 04:25:43,500
And in fact, recently, one of the larger offshore operators paid a fine to the United States Department of Justice in an attempt to come into the legal market.

2661
04:25:43,500 --> 04:25:49,000
So we are definitely seeing that we're not creating more wagering.

2662
04:25:49,000 --> 04:26:04,000
We're taking what was existing illegal wagering and bringing it into the light, bringing it into the legal market, which is obviously was one of the aims of this bill.

2663
04:26:04,000 --> 04:26:06,000
Any further questions?

2664
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:10,000
Representative Ames, you have your hand up again?

2665
04:26:10,000 --> 04:26:12,000
No, no, no.

2666
04:26:12,000 --> 04:26:14,000
Okay.

2667
04:26:14,000 --> 04:26:16,000
Further questions?

2668
04:26:16,000 --> 04:26:24,000
I don't see any, so I'm going to close the public hearing on House Bill 354.

2669
04:26:24,000 --> 04:26:26,000
Thank you.

2670
04:26:26,000 --> 04:26:38,500
As a means committee, Representative Lang is going to head out, and I'll see you in a week or so when we talk about keynote.

2671
04:26:38,500 --> 04:26:40,500
Okay.

2672
04:26:40,500 --> 04:26:50,000
we're going to be discussing this bill again in our work session you Thank you, Ways and Means Committee.

2673
04:26:50,000 --> 04:27:00,500
Representative Lang is going to head out, and I'll see you in a week or so when we talk about keynote.

2674
04:27:00,500 --> 04:27:17,000
OK, we're going to be discussing this bill again in our work session on the 10th, along with all the other bills we have in the exec that we've heard to this point.

2675
04:27:17,000 --> 04:27:19,000
Anything from the committee?

2676
04:27:19,000 --> 04:27:21,000
Saying none is home.
