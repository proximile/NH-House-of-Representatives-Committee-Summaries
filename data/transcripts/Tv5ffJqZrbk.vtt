you can see it's gone through some
 
00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
changes over the last 200
 
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
years back in the day it was just a
 
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
two-story building the second floor and
 
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
the first floor were the only thing here
 
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
and there was no big Portico and that
 
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
great big wonderful golden dome that
 
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
didn't come until in the midst of the
 
00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
Civil War so we had a very modest
 
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
building but a building that has stood
 
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
here for over 200 years during the Civil
 
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
War our legislators realized that we
 
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
needed a larger building and we wanted
 
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
to show that New Hampshire was here to
 
00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 align:start position:0%
stay so they added on a third floor and
 
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
they put these big Granite columns up
 
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
front to make what we call the Portico
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
and above that great giant Dome was
 
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
added to the top of our state house
 
00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
where it has stood ever since and when
 
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
you visit you can see that golden dome
 
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
from miles

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
the Hall of flags we have 88 Civil War
 
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
battle Flags looking at the flags you'll
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
notice that some of them are not in
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
great condition some of them are
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
shredded and torn but some of them are
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
also in great
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
condition the flag bearer was in charge
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
of keeping keep the flag held up high
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
this was a way of communication because
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
back then there was no cell phones or
 
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkies on top of the flags there
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
are numbers and these are the regiment
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
numbers or the group numbers and we have
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
flags with the numbers 5 2 and 12 these
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
flags were all at the Battle of
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
Gettysburg the worst battle in America's
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
history we also have flags from World
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
War I and World War II you'll notice
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
that these flags are in much better
 
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
condition addition because at that time
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
the flags were not carried out into the
 
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%

centuries back in the day legislators

Lincoln on the walls of our state house
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%

Hampshire on the arm of the chair there
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
are numbers and those numbers match up
 
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
to the electronic voting box the
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
electronic voting box has three
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
different buttons the white button is
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
the activation button but also takes
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
attendance just like in school the
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house has to know who is
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
here and who is not there are three
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
different ways that representatives vote
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
here in this room quite often they do a
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
Voice vote but sometimes it's hard to
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
decide if the yes or no was louder
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
question all those in favor say I oppose
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
nay no yeah the chair is not sure let's
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
there'll be a division vote there are
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
also division votes where they use the
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
electronic voting buttons there is a yes
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
button and a no button and on the
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
scoreboards it will appear how many
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
people voted yes and how many people
 
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
voted no electronic voting
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
Representatives will only have 30
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
seconds to vote and if you don't vote
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
within that 30 seconds the house clerk
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
will call you out in front of everybody
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
and ask what your vote is sometimes that
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
can be a little bit embarrassing the
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
house will be attentive to the state of
 
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.790 align:start position:0%

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
and on a roll call vote the
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
representative's name is attached to the
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
vote and you will find out how
 
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.670 align:start position:0%
vote and you will find out how
Representatives

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
voted up above is a balcony and this is
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
what we call the visitors Gallery the
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
visitors Gallery is open to the public
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
and you would be able to come in and
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
watch your representatives voting if you
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
weren't able to make it there is online
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
convenience we are now in the Senate
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
chamber this room has been in use for
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
over 200 years you'll notice that this
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
room is much smaller and that is because
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
we have just 24 senators in New
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senators also have assigned
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
seats and they sit by district from
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
district one who represents the North
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
Country all the way to District 24 Down
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
By The Sea Coast to become a senator you
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
must be 30 years old and live in New
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for seven consecutive years
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
Senators represent a lot more people
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
than Representatives they represent over
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
50,000 people but per the Constitution
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
they actually get paid the same amount
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
as Representatives $100 a year the
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
Senate President and the speaker of the
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
house they get paid a little bit more
 
00:15:04.959 --> 00:15:06.030 align:start position:0%
house they get paid a little bit more
money

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
$125 a year but they have a lot more
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility this room is much
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
different because Senators also have
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
desks and
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
microphones when the Senators wish to
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
speak the Senators actually have to get
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
the attention of the Senate President
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
the Senators raise their hand and go
 
00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:25.110 align:start position:0%
the Senators raise their hand and go
like

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
this and if the Senators have a question
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
they raise their hand and draw a
 
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.949 align:start position:0%
they raise their hand and draw a
question

00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
mark here in the Senate there is also
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
three different ways to vote there is a
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
Voice vote just like in the house but
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
the division vote is different all the
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
yeses would stand up to be counted and
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
all the NOS would stand up to be counted
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
for a roll call vote the clerk will call
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
out each Senator by name and state if
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's a yes Vote or a no vote here in the
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
Senate we also have a visitors Gallery
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that it's much smaller
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
than the one that we have in the house
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
chamber but everyone is welcome as long
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
as we can fit you up there you can come
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
in and watch often times we have fourth
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
graders that actually come in and kneel
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
in front of all the
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
guests when you come into the Senate
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
chamber one of the first things you
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
usually notice are the beautiful murals
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
on the wall those murals are really new
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
to the Senate chamber back in the day
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
the room was very plain white walls a
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
few paintings every once in a while and
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the Senator's tables that was about
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
room later in 1942 a wonderful artist
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
named Barry fauler from Keem New
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he painted these murals they
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
were painted on linen they were painted
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
on cloth at his home and then brought to
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
the state house and glued to the walls
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
of the Senate where they have been ever
 
00:16:59.540 --> 00:16:59.550 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
so the Barry fauler murals all four of
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
them represent something that's
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
important to New Hampshire here in this
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
first mural is New Hampshire's last
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
Royal Governor John Wentworth along with
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
the Reverend Eliza Willock and they're
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
at the first graduation at Dartmouth
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
College and so that mural is to remind
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
us the importance of Education in New
 
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the next mural well here he is
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
again Daniel Webster but in this mural
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
he's only about nine years old he's
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
sitting on the floor of his parents
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
store in Salsbury and before him is the
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution I mentioned
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster as the defender of the
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution well when he was in about
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
fourth grade he memorized the United
 
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.789 align:start position:0%
fourth grade he memorized the United
States

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution the mural is to highlight
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
our government in our constitution New
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was the first state to create
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
its own state
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
constitution the next Muro probably one
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
of my favorite shows a group of artists
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
Barry fauler painted himself into the
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
mural with some of his artistic friends
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
the man sitting with the ducks in his
 
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
lap that is Abbott the fogner and the
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
developed the protective color theory
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
today you know it as camouflage in in
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
fact this group of artists went to
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
France during World War I where they
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
introduced their protective color theory
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that is why it's called that French
 
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
and that is why it's called that French
name

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
camouflage the mural on the end there he
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
is John Stark putting on his coat ready
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
to head out to battle during the
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
Revolutionary War one of New Hampshire's
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
other firsts were we were the first
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
state to declare our independence from
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
the British and John Stark was one of
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
our greatest leaders in
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
1945 sitting in this room lawmakers
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
voted on our state
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
motto with John Stark's picture right
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
there before him one of the Senators
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
seated near here stood up and he said
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
this should be our state motto Live Free
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
or Die the other senators all agreed
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
with a loud unanimous vote they moved
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
that bill onto the house where they also
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
agreed and that bill then made its final
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
step like all of our state bills do
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
anything that wants to become a law has
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be voted by the senators and
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
representatives but it doesn't become a
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
law until it goes down the hall to the
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
desk of the governor and now we're on
 
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.090 align:start position:0%
our way to the governor's
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.070 align:start position:0%
our way to the governor's
[Music]

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
office here in the governor's reception
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
area are the more recent paintings of
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
Governors looking at the paintings you
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
can see that the governors choose where
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
they have their portrait done Governor
 
00:20:07.149 --> 00:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
Jud Greg has Mount Washington in the
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
background Governor Merill has his
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
painting with the gold dome in the
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
background jeene Shaheen's painting is
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
done in the executive Council chamber
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
Jean Shaheen was the first elected woman
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
Governor we're now in the executive
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
Council chamber here is where New
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Governors have been working
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
and meeting only since 1910 because our
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
governor's office is located in what we
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
call the new part of the building only
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
110 years old and around here that makes
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
it pretty
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
new on the walls are some of the
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
earliest governors of New Hampshire
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
including those from England Governor
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
Bernett governor beler and everyone's
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
favorite over there Governor
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
Dudley those governors we didn't elect
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
those governors they were sent here by
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
the king of England to rule over New
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when they ruled over New
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they did whatever they wanted
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
so they could choose all their friends
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
to be judges they could put all their
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
friends give them all the best jobs and
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
pay them whatever they wanted do you
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
think the people of New Hampshire
 
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good idea oh no they
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
didn't and so today in New Hampshire we
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
have another special piece of government
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's called the executive Council
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
the people of your District oneth of the
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
state actually elect an executive
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
counselor also to represent them so if
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
your our governor is from the North
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
Country he can't give all the jobs and
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
all the appointments to people up north
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
or if they're from the Sea Coast Area we
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
have a counselor from that area every
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
one of you has an executive counselor
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
who represents your part of the state
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
and the people who live near you and
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
this room is where the governor meets
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
with his five executive counselors the
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
counselors actually sit in order of
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
where they live starting in district one
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
up in the north country and working our
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
way around the state down to District 5
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
in the southwest corner the governor
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
sits at the head of the table there are
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
times when the governor uses this room
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
to actually sign bills into law and then
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
we very often have many people in here
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
the day they sign the law for the potato
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
Bill our state vegetable the governor's
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
table was surrounded by fourth graders
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
this room is also where the governor
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
gives many of their speeches and you
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes will see that on television
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
with the governor standing at the podium
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
discussing things governor and Council
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
meet very much like the representatives
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
do they meet on a schedule but if the
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
governor wants anything to go forward
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
with the executive branch he needs a
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
vote of these counselors it makes it
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
hard but it also makes it so the
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
governors make the best decisions for
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
the people we're the only state that do
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
it this way when the governor goes to
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
sign bills into law the check and
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
balance has already happened because the
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
Senators and the representatives have
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
represented us and voted for that so to
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
sign a bill into law the governor can
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful ceremony and do it
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
right here or he could actually go to
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
the school or to the town where that
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
bill was first brought up one of the
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
most famous bills for my fourth graders
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
is the pumpkin Bill fourth graders from
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
Harrisville New Hampshire felt the
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
pumpkin would make a great state symol
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
as our state official fruit of New
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that bill went before the
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
house where they voted yes it went
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
before the Senate where they voted yes
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
and then it ended up on the desk of the
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
governor and the governor at that time
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
realized those students had put so much
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
work into this that he brought the bill
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
with him to their very school and signed
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
that bill into law right there all the
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
bills whether it's something fun like a
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
pumpkin bill or what should be our state
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
beverage or something really serious
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
like protecting our people of our state
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
The Bullying bill that fourth graders
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
helped bring forward they all go through
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
the same process with the same serious
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
weighing out of whether it's a good law
 
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.020 align:start position:0%
weighing out of whether it's a good law
or

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:33.030 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.789 align:start position:0%
