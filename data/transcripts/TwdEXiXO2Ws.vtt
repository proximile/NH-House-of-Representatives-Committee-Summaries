that
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
a portsmouth ward had dropped so you can
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
substitute this for what you have in
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
your packet from yesterday so we kept
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
that separate
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
you also have in front of you something
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
that's been packed passed out by
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
mapathon they passed out something
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday in regards to house districts
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
today they have passed out something for
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
you in regards to the congressional
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
districts you also have in front of you
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
a map of grafton county representatives
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
as proposed by representative fellows
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
that is separate from your committee
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
packet information
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
and then you should have a new
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet which picks up
 
00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet which picks up
after

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
it continues from where we left
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday and begins with what we will
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
be doing today
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
you will note that number 19 is there
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
and you might want to go to the bottom
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
of your stack of papers for today
 
00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:16.949 align:start position:0%
of your stack of papers for today
uh

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:20.389 align:start position:0%
uh
19.

00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner maps
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
that representative lane so kindly
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
agreed would be provided
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
these represent
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
a proposed map which is no change from
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
the current map
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
so you will now have
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
the lines for the current map and the
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
associated numerical
 
00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.069 align:start position:0%
associated numerical
calculation

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.750 align:start position:0%
calculation
to

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
with the proposed maps we reviewed
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday so that's why that packet is
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
designated as 19 you can sort and
 
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.509 align:start position:0%
designated as 19 you can sort and
compare

00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
compare
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
as you
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
desire which leaves us
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
numbers 12 through 18 on your list to
 
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.110 align:start position:0%
numbers 12 through 18 on your list to
review

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
that would include county
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
representatives for grafton
 
00:14:11.839 --> 00:14:13.110 align:start position:0%
representatives for grafton
stratford

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
stratford
 
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.389 align:start position:0%
stratford
hillsborough

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
cheshire carol and sullivan
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the congressional district maps
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
and you should have gotten emails for
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
all of those yesterday and you have hard
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
copies of them before you today
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
for the rep maps um
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that the a's are
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
those proposed by the
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
minority members of the committee and
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the b's are the
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
those maps proposed by the
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
majority members
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
they do not have the names like they had
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
on yesterday does anybody have any
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions in regards to the paperwork
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
and follow-up from yesterday before we
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
i just had i just had one
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
regarding the maps on the website i
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
understand that those still are not up
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
there and i
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could give us a briefing
 
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could give us a briefing
on

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
what is going on with the website so
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've been promised
 
00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.829 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've been promised
representatives

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that anybody makes any
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
promises when you're dependent on
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
somebody else promises are
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
probably not a great thing as you might
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
know though you were not here yesterday
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've been having some problems with eit
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
site since it was converted to a new
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
format for the entire house
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday during the meeting we
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
managed to get solve the issue of
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
finally getting the submitted testimony
 
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.710 align:start position:0%
finally getting the submitted testimony
up

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
and by the end of the meeting when you
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
clicked on the submitted testimony you
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
could actually open it
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
there were discussions about
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
communicating with it i take full
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
responsibility for shutting my computer
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
off at about 10 20 last night
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
and when i was in bed and realized i had
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
not officially sent an email request i
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
did not have the energy to get up and
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
turn my computer back on
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
so this morning before i did anything
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
else i did turn my computer on and sent
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
the email it was aware of the issue i
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
have proposed a format
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
for the maps to be placed on the website
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
and it's my hope that that will be
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
done by the end of our meeting today
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
but again i am entirely dependent on i.t
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
and their ability to address the issue i
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
know that they have been told this is a
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
priority to deal with this page so it is
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
my hope uh that the maps as proposed by
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
members will be up certainly by the end
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the day certainly by the end of the
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
week so
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber that's where we are
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i just i'm very
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
mindful that the public needs to be able
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
to see them in order to be able to
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
present any kind of meaningful and of
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
course we've had paper copies here
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
available for people who are here
 
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.670 align:start position:0%
available for people who are here
so

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
we expect the i.t issues to be resolved
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
today but then again you're looking at
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
the person who did sit at her computer
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock on monday night and
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
clicked on the website and went oh no so
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're making progress everybody so
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best we can
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
all right so we will start with review
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.590 align:start position:0%
of the
maps

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
for the representatives um just for
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
purposes i i guess we'll just go
 
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.470 align:start position:0%
purposes i i guess we'll just go
alphabetically

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
alphabetically
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
as we go through them it'll just make it
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
a little easier to follow along since
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's how though this isn't quite how
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
it was put together for today
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
um because i do think carol comes before
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
cheshire but we will go with a
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
which would be cheshire
 
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.029 align:start position:0%
which would be cheshire
and

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
cheshire should be 12 and there's a 12 a
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
and b it is first on our list for the
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
the today um and why don't we start with
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
who is going to speak to the a map
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative marjorie smith thank you
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much madam chair and
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
efforts to
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
do what i think we all want to have
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
happen and that's make this information
 
00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:24.470 align:start position:0%
happen and that's make this information
available

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.590 align:start position:0%
available
uh

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
to the state um
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
i am
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
now presenting
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
a proposal
 
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.630 align:start position:0%
a proposal
for

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
house maps for cheshire county
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
and uh as an introduction i want to say
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
that as we worked on these maps
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
in addition to the constitutional and
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
some initial goals one was to make house
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
districts as small as possible
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
for many reasons
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
many of the people who testified before
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
our 10 listening sessions
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
asked for that
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
um it is uh
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
the larger a district is
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
the more expensive it is for a candidate
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
to run and since trying to get 400
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
highly qualified well 800 highly
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
qualified people to run in a small state
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
is hard
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the smaller the districts are is the
 
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.470 align:start position:0%
the smaller the districts are is the
better

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
i also want to make the point that as we
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
try to make a fair map
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly do not claim to make a
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
perfect map
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
particularly in small counties such as
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
cheshire there are a lot of problems
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
because we can't cross county borders
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
and because towns that are on the border
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
give fewer choices for combinations
 
00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:07.029 align:start position:0%
give fewer choices for combinations
so

00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
it we don't claim perfection
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
claim the best that we could come up
 
00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:15.909 align:start position:0%
claim the best that we could come up
with

00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
the um the cheshire map that we're
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
presenting includes 18
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
total districts
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
14 are base districts and
 
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.870 align:start position:0%
14 are base districts and
four

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.669 align:start position:0%
four
are

00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
are
floaterial

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
floaterial
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
and that is for 22
 
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
and that is for 22
seats

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
seats
and

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go quickly through them
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
because i think it helps
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee as well as
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.149 align:start position:0%
a goal that so many people asked us to
follow

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
follow

district 13 is winchester one seat which
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%

15 which is a one
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
seat floaterial
 
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.230 align:start position:0%
seat floaterial
of

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
keane wards two and three and
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%

district 17 is a two-seat floaterial
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
of jeffrey marlborough
 
00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:56.390 align:start position:0%
of jeffrey marlborough
um

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and rindge
 
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.710 align:start position:0%
and uh and rindge
um

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
jeffrey and rinch send their
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
high schoolers to connor high school
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
district 18 is a one-seat flow terial
 
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.630 align:start position:0%
district 18 is a one-seat flow terial
of

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
districts 11 13 and 14.
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
so the net result is that this map
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
increases the number of single seat
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
districts from 11 as exists now
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
to 15
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
and the total deviation for the proposed
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
and that is the best that we could do
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
someone has some suggestions to make it
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
better we are
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
the colors are helpful but it's still
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
i just have a question representative
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
smith i thought at the beginning you
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
said 14 base
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
single districts is it
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
15 or 14. um wait i have to go back here
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
it's not willing representative weber do
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
you have an answer to the 14 base
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
and four
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
and one of one of the floaters had two
 
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.669 align:start position:0%
and one of one of the floaters had two
members

00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
which is sometimes unusual but makes the
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
all right any questions or
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
for representative smith any comments on
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing any so
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
on page 12 b there is
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
a proposed map for house representatives
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
for cheshire county
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask the other
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith to address those
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
in public testimony in cheshire one of
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
the things we heard was
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the river towns should be kept
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
together this plan accomplishes that
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
it isn't a rule but
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
i don't like to treat city wards
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
differently than others by peeling one
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
or two off and combining them with other
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
towns we look for opportunities to do
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
that to keep them together honestly in
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
all parts of the state it's just simply
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
not possible but in this one it was
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
kings numbers all by themselves
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
don't get them there but if you add the
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
channel to marlborough you pre get a
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
pretty good seven seat district
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
and advantage there also is that since
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
the committee voted to use the equalized
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
ward values with this plan we don't care
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
how it ends up because it doesn't affect
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
there is only one fletcherial and that's
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
at the bottom where the
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers were low and we had to put a
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
bunch of different towns together but
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
overall it's laid out pretty well
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
geographically um in the blue towns
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's a four seat district
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
candidates will campaign up and down the
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
connecticut river
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
the top right is put together those are
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative smith i have to
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
ask by blue do you mean purple
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
no he means light blue
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
oh light blue okay thank you light blue
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
oh do we have shoe blues well no i just
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that the river's on
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
the left yeah the river the river ones
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
are blue right and the river's on the
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
left right that's right okay they are
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
and some of the those are some of the
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
towns that have given rise that the best
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
thing about vermont is the view across
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
the river
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh so overall that's it uh only we could
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
accomplish this with only one fliterial
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
i just wondered aside from the
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
issue of the river towns why the
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
why the decision was made even even
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
including the river towns
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
to reject the constitutional mandate of
 
00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:40.230 align:start position:0%
to reject the constitutional mandate of
the

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
areas that have enough to have their own
 
00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:43.669 align:start position:0%
areas that have enough to have their own
reps

00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
reps
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
which has been rejected in 13 of the 14
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
towns that really ought to have their
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
own i mean i know it's mathematically
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
impossible to do all of them but
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
what what was the thinking on those
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
um well do you have an example um
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of people believed walpole
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
was but it's not actually
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
a constitutionally mandated town because
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's not within what's generally
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
accepted for a one-district deviation
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's a little over
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
i understand that but the constitutional
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
mandate makes no
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
earthly sense
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
if you hold that it means that only
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
those towns which are within a constitu
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
within the exact deviation
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
are entitled to local representation
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
and that anything that exceeds
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
that is not entitled to local
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
representation that seems to make a
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
mockery of what
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the people who talk to me when
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
that was being voted in
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
thought they were voting on
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
i understand that walpole is slightly
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
too high
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
it is alas too high by only
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
16 people
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm pretty sure that all 16 of those
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
people would gladly agree to be
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
underrepresented if they could have
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
their very own district but
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts differ on that and and i
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
understand that the deviation needs to
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
be accounted for so
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's what happens in in the other plan
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think we don't try to achieve
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
that though at the expense of the rest
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
of the county or having the county
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
numbers go over 10 percent overall i
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
respectfully think we just see it
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
differently probably
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
i've made my point so we're good
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
on this 12b for cheshire or
 
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.630 align:start position:0%
on this 12b for cheshire or
anything

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
the next one in our packet is carol
 
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.350 align:start position:0%
the next one in our packet is carol
um

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
carol why don't we start with
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.269 align:start position:0%

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
turcotte
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
all right there may be questions
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
after that uh
 
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.830 align:start position:0%
after that uh
carroll

carroll
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
county representative map a
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
would speak to that
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron right thank you
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
um i'll go through all the districts
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
because i know anybody that might be
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
watching this online now or later won't
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
have maps to refer to so uh and i'll
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
make comments where i think it adds some
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
relevant information
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
the proposed map includes ten total
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
districts seven are base and three floor
 
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.710 align:start position:0%
districts seven are base and three floor
tyrio

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
tyrio
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
with a total of 15 seats
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
district one would include bartlett
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
hearts location in jackson with one seat
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that's the same as the existing
 
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.269 align:start position:0%
and that's the same as the existing
district

00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
district 2 albany chatham conway hales
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
location and sandwich for three seats
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
district 3 madison and tamworth
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
during the public input sessions a
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
speaker noted that tamworth shared
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
interest with madison to the east and
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
sandwich to the west so those two towns
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
are paired
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
district four would include brookfield
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
eaton effingham freedom and wakefield
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
which would receive two seats
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
district five would be moultonborough
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
which is now eligible to
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
receive its its own base district its
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
own seat dedicated seat
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
district six would be ossipee again
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
ossipee is a town that now gets its own
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
base district based on population
 
00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:34.950 align:start position:0%

changes

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%

00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
district seven tufton borough and
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro are put together for two seats
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
both towns send high schoolers to
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
kingswood high
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
tufton borough sits in between three
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
towns it could have had could have their
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
own districts based on popular
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
population so
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
decision was to pair it with wolfeboro
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
and give molten burrow and ossipee their
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
own own seats district eight is a
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
one-seat floaterial of districts one and
 
00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.630 align:start position:0%
one-seat floaterial of districts one and
two

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
district nine is a two-seat floaterial
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
of districts three three to five
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
and district ten is a one-seat
 
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.310 align:start position:0%
and district ten is a one-seat
floaterial

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
floaterial
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
of districts six and seven
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
all three towns and this floater will
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
send their high schoolers to kingswood
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
high so they have a
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
common interest common connection there
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
the map increases the number of
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
districts in the county from eight to
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
ten instead of one seven town filterial
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
and one eleven town floaterial the
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
proposed map creates three floaters
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
containing three towns four towns and
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
eight towns
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
total deviation for the proposed map is
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
some of the districts are the same any
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing any so that is
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.069 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
who's going to be doing 14 a grafton
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
that would be oh that's right
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron okay
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.310 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
the proposed map for grafton includes 15
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
total districts
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
14 base and one full terial with a total
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
of 26 districts and again i'll identify
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
the contents of each district and
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
highlight any any elements that i
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
thought led to the decision of pairing
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
certain towns
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
district one would include littleton and
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
monroe with two seats
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
bethlehem and franconia for one seat are
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
put together in district two
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
currently they're in two separate
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
districts but both towns send their high
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
schoolers to profile high
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%

eastern land of lisbon lyman and sugar
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
hill would
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
have one seat
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%

piermont with two seats
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
and all four towns send their high
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
schoolers to woodsville high
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
district 5 would be two seats containing
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
ellsworth lincoln livermore thornton
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%

and wentworth
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
for one seat
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
district seven remains the same campton
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
receives one seat
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
district eight puts together ashland
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
holding this in plymouth for two seats
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and all three towns send their high
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%

district nine pairs bridgewater and
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
bristol for one seat
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
district 10 puts together alexandria
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
district 12 remains the same enfield uh
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
receives one seat and it's uh
 
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
receives one seat and it's uh
it's

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
what it is formed as now
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
district 13 again same as it exists
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
currently it's hanover and lime for four
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
seats both towns send their high
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
schoolers to a hanover high
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
lebanon remains the same as a
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
city district with four seats district
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
15 is a one-seat floaterial
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
consisting of districts 9 through 12
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
and all the towns that send high
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
schoolers to muscoma valley regional are
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
included in this floaterial
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
the map prioritizes single-seat
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
districts as much as possible and the
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
total deviation for the proposed map is
 
00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:00.069 align:start position:0%
total deviation for the proposed map is
7.48

00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
7.48
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to acknowledge
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
the map that was emailed to the
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
committee by representative sally
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
fellows recently and we have copies i
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
think aren't tables
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
we get a lot a massive amount of
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
material and i'm only acknowledging it
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
because i i like it to kind of percolate
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
to the top of the massive volume of
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
paper that we we have before us
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
what i found interesting or intriguing
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
is that the largest district in her
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
proposal contains six towns
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
whereas there's a ten-town flow terial
 
00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.109 align:start position:0%
whereas there's a ten-town flow terial
in

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:32.670 align:start position:0%
both proposals 14a and 14b
 
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.630 align:start position:0%
both proposals 14a and 14b
[Music]

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
she also had creates fewer districts 13
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
versus the 15 and 18 districts and the
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
other two plans before us
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
one of the downsides is that the town of
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
enfield which is entitled to a seat of
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
its own uh is included in a six-town
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
cluster and you know
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
we've been taking the position that we
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
should create districts for towns that
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
have sufficient population for their own
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative and that's been an
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
important criteria for us in the
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
development of maps
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
but again i thought the approach was
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
intriguing there were fewer districts
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
there were smaller districts and i just
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
would encourage members to at least take
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
a look at it and see if there's anything
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
that appeals to them as we head toward
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
our executive sessions on these bills
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron any questions on
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
seeing any
 
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.470 align:start position:0%
seeing any
so

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
14b grafton representative turcotte i
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
think you're speaking to this one
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh grafton county
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
we end up with uh
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
18 districts
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
and two floats
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
again i am not going to read them all
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
off hopefully these will be up on the
 
00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
off hopefully these will be up on the
website

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
soon for everybody who wants to look at
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
them to see
 
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.750 align:start position:0%
them to see
uh

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
oh and the deviation range sorry minus
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
3.91 to 4.53 for a total deviation of
 
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.710 align:start position:0%
3.91 to 4.53 for a total deviation of
8.44

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative lane uh yes i i realize
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
um we're not he's not reading out
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
the towns but could you talk about
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
what the priorities were when you put
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
together this map
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
our priorities was developing maps that
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:40.829 align:start position:0%
 
priorities

00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
parameters that we've set by vote in
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
all our maps have been
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
developed using the same criteria
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
but other than that i'm not going to get
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative weber
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
oh i think representative mcguire was
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
before me
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i was just wanted to
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
comment that the two maps are actually
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
extremely similar
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
minor changes minor changes in the float
 
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.309 align:start position:0%
minor changes minor changes in the float
aside

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
aside
 
00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
aside
the

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.630 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
the 14b has more districts because it
 
00:40:45.119 --> 00:40:46.309 align:start position:0%
the 14b has more districts because it
divided

00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
divided
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
gave lebanon four districts instead of
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
one dividing each ward and then then a
 
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.670 align:start position:0%
one dividing each ward and then then a
afloat

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
so assuming their their awards are good
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
they will get
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
they'll therefore their four
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
representatives will run in four
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
different districts rather than at large
 
00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
different districts rather than at large
but

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
it's remarkable how similar the two maps
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay the next one on our list is 15a
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i see two names on the list
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron and
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
um i will defer to representative
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
wilhelm to take the lead on this um
 
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.069 align:start position:0%
wilhelm to take the lead on this um
he's

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the northern part of the of the
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
county and uh i'll be happy to weigh in

on the southern part
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
and i hope you do
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%

cereals so
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh there's a two seat flow tyrial that's
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
goffstown and where
 
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.790 align:start position:0%
goffstown and where
together

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%

cereals for manchester now
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
as previously i'm right now currently in
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
district 42. my floateria would change
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
that gets a little bit a little bit
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
harder for me to seek re-election it's a
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
good fair map
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
district 40 is a three seat flow terial
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's composed of manchester words one
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
and two
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
district 41
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
would be a three-seat floaterial
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
manchester awards five
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
and seven through nine
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
the new district 42 would be a
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
three-seat floaterial which would be
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
manchester ward's three so that's
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
downtown the mill yard
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh and all of the west side wards 10 11
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
and 12. so they all share the river
 
00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:14.309 align:start position:0%
and 12. so they all share the river
there

00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh district 43 a two-seat floaterial
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
composed of hudson and litchfield
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
district 44
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be a one-seat floaterial composed
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
district 45
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
the one seat floaterial composed of new
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
and last but not least
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
district 46
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
a one sea floaterial composed of
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
brookline greenville hollis and mason
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh hollis and brookline they share a
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
so you know a few features of this map
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh map keeps manchester and nashua
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
completely separate from other towns and
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
base districts and influence
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
if you feel like it's a good thing
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
um the map separates pelham and hudson
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh something that we've heard a lot
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
about not just during this process but
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
over the last decade
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
and the map also increases the number of
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
towns with their own base districts
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
there are 15 total in this map total
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
deviation 9.17
 
00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.790 align:start position:0%
deviation 9.17
percent

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
um and just a note
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
about manchester
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know our our total population is
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
115 844.
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
um you divide that by our magic number
 
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.589 align:start position:0%
um you divide that by our magic number
3444

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
3444
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh and you get just over over 33 so you
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
know both 33 or 34 reps for manchester
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
within that 10 range of deviation
 
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.710 align:start position:0%
within that 10 range of deviation
um

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm obviously pretty partial to it
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
because it keeps manchester whole i'm
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
anything to add representative bergeron
 
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.549 align:start position:0%
anything to add representative bergeron
um

00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
actually you did a very good job the
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
only thing i might point out is that 26
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
of the 46 districts are unchanged and i
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
think given the
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
volume of seats we're dealing with
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
anybody else on 15 a
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm on or not
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
red button down
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have a red button
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
christina can you hear representative
 
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.190 align:start position:0%
christina can you hear representative
porter

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
porter
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now yes that seemed to
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
amplify a bit um
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
i wanted to thank um
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
make a mention here given that
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
the northern part of hillsborough county
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
is what i represent so i have a pretty
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
good feel for what's going on when i
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
look at this map
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i would i'm very grateful to see
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
that the 10-town floatarial district
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
that includes hillsborough currently
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
goes from hillsborough all the way down
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
to greenville which is eliminated on
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
this map
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
ten towns is
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
for a flotarial
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
is a huge
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
thing and i'm glad to see that in this
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
this map it's gone it was hard to
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
represent all those ten towns
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to see that it was a
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
consideration to include the town of uh
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
deering with the towns of hillsboro and
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
windsor because we have a lot of common
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
interests and we know
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
we and they they really do belong
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
together they're almost one community so
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
i want to say thank you
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
to in this plan to those considerations
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
because they make a big difference in
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
whoever is elected to represent
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
that area of the state
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
turning to 15 b is a hillsborough map
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
for county representatives also
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte or barry
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
turcotte okay thank you madam chair uh
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county we have it at a
 
00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county we have it at a
total

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
of 45 districts
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
one note on the city of manchester
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
instead of floating
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
four cities together
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
four wards sorry
 
00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.790 align:start position:0%
four wards sorry
[Music]

00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
instead of floating the four wards
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
together we floated three
 
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.670 align:start position:0%
together we floated three
together

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
of course nashua each one of those words
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
gets their own
 
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.510 align:start position:0%
gets their own
representative

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
and our overall deviation on here is
 
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.030 align:start position:0%
and our overall deviation on here is
negative

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
5.01 to positive
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions for representative turcotte
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm curious your
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
your map has i think 32 seats is that
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
right for the city of manchester
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.190 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
um

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just i'm curious uh it seems
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
like either 33 or 34 would be
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate based on population size you
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
know both 33 or 34 would be
 
00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.150 align:start position:0%
know both 33 or 34 would be
within

00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
generally accepted deviation
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason
 
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.270 align:start position:0%
um is there a reason
that

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
manchester appears to be slightly
 
00:52:05.599 --> 00:52:07.270 align:start position:0%
manchester appears to be slightly
underrepresented

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
underrepresented
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh manchester the deviation on the
 
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.870 align:start position:0%
uh manchester the deviation on the
individual

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
awards come in at 4.94
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
within the deviation ranges that we're
 
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.510 align:start position:0%
within the deviation ranges that we're
using

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
as compared to the overall deviation is
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
that what you're talking about
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
representative yeah just overall
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
deviation within the county okay so it's
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
a question of individual versus overall
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter did you have your
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question oops
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
i'm having a problem here today
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
but no i'm okay good um
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
again i want to bring up the fact that
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
in this map there is a nine-town
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
floatario um it is not as geographically
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
spread out as the ten-town floataria
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's current however it is a lot of
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
towns and difficult
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
to represent
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about that
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
and also looking at these
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
these maps i'm seeing
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
some districts
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
that are becoming more of one color in
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
terms of political
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
stan political point of view than they
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
just knowing this area of the state
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty concerned about
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
the groupings of certain towns together
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the reasons why that was occurring
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
so i just want to bring that forward i
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
know we don't
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
try to get ourselves reelected but
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
something like that might have been in
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
the works with looking at this map
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
that was 15 that was hillsborough
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
next we have stratford
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative wilhelm
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
there i am with my head down again
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
i just have a question
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd be curious to know
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.190 align:start position:0%
one thing i'd be curious to know
uh

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
with all of our maps is if there are any
 
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
with all of our maps is if there are any
um

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
i i think they're they're minority
 
00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.430 align:start position:0%
i i think they're they're minority
majority

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
districts and i suppose because we're
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
talking about hillsborough county i'd
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
just be curious to know if
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
we've taken a look at that to make sure
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
in compliance with with federal laws
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
specifically nashua i think that's where
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i'd be able to give some
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
insight into that thank you
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative so um i believe it was
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
the first or second one of our meetings
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
you guys made reference to this so i um
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
loaded up the
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
database into an access program
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i ran um every voting location ward
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
town right um in the state to see what
 
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.349 align:start position:0%
town right um in the state to see what
is

00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is obviously an extremely sensitive
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know the the
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
most um
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
the least white right um
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
the most racially diverse area in the
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
state that i was able to find was
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
actually manchester's ward 5
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
which was 55 percent white and that was
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
when you removed hispanic and latino
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
from the the census will put hispanic
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
and latino into
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
the white character the white categories
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
catechur excuse me
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
categorization that's the nice stutter
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
so that it's actually manchester it's
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
actually our home city uh it's
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
manchester's uh manchester ward five
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
and because there is to my knowledge at
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
least the the
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
the analysis that i did there is no
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
voting single voting location in the
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
state that has a majority minority
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
population now that may change in 10
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
years from manchester's ward 5 but as of
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
today i don't because you guys made
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
mention of that you would like to look
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
at that so i went and i looked at it and
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you would do it without
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
actually going in and breaking up a ward
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
now once again that could change when
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
they redraw the ward lines but we're
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
operating underneath the current ward
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
lines that's right so maybe uh
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
there could be a provision within
 
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:28.549 align:start position:0%
there could be a provision within
uh

00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
bill that that
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
looks at at the house maps
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
to to account for that
 
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.589 align:start position:0%
to to account for that
um

00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
it may not be necessary this time around
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
so maybe are you saying that it's not
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
necessary in this redistricting but it
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
could be in 10 years
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely in 10 years because we don't
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
know what the future will hold um but
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know if the the state went from i
 
00:56:51.359 --> 00:56:52.349 align:start position:0%
you know if the the state went from i
think

00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
92 or 93 white to 87 and 0.9 or
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
something like that overall
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
and my my quick analysis of that change
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
was that it was done basically on the
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
category the the largest growth was
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
hispanic and mixed race
 
00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:07.910 align:start position:0%
hispanic and mixed race
um

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
but it's you know if manchester awards
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
fi i believe number two was awarded
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
nashua and the award escapes me right
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
now um but they if i recall and i'm kind
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
of digging in the cobwebs it's been a
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
couple of months since i've looked at
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
this but that ward was in the 60s in
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
terms of um
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
total total percent white
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how to your point about
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
a provision or a clause i don't know how
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
we would be able to predict the future
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
of what they're going to do this time
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
around but to your point about in 10
 
00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:36.630 align:start position:0%
around but to your point about in 10
years

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
it absolutely could be something to look
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
at in 10 years but that's a problem for
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
not a problem but that's an issue for 10
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
years down the road
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up sure is is there
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
any guidance that we should be providing
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
the cities of
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
manchester or nashua as they redraw
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
their lines as it relates to this
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
i i would leave that to the individual
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
city that i'm i'm per on on my opinion
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not ready to issue guidance to any
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
city or town to draw lines along race
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that makes me
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that would be far beyond the
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of anything this committee
 
00:58:10.799 --> 00:58:11.990 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of anything this committee
does

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else on issues before we move on
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
and it's my intent that we are going to
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
take a short break after this map
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%

uh four floaterials
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
we have an overall deviation range of
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
minus 4.2 to plus
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%

00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
i'm delighted to present this to you i
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
stress again that
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
in addition to the constitutional and
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislative requirements
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
we worked very very hard to have smaller
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
districts to have single member
 
00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.710 align:start position:0%
districts to have single member
districts

00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for
 
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.069 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for
citizens

01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
to relate to their
 
01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:08.390 align:start position:0%
to relate to their
representatives

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we acknowledge that these maps are
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
not perfect
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
i do want to make one additional comment
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
state constitutional requirement
 
01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:23.829 align:start position:0%
state constitutional requirement
about

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring that any district that
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
meets the
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate number is entitled to
 
01:00:33.119 --> 01:00:34.230 align:start position:0%
appropriate number is entitled to
be

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
have its own district
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that we will
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
find that there's a little difference of
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
opinion here there are some people who
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
seem to think that the count
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
of that particular town would have to be
 
01:00:48.799 --> 01:00:50.630 align:start position:0%
of that particular town would have to be
exactly

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
the number
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
which in this case is you know the 3404
 
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
which in this case is you know the 3404
number

01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
but in fact
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that the intention is that
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
that is a minimum
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh to say that if you were over that you
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't have your one and then
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
the additional are handled the way we
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
handle everything you know combining in
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
some ways with other
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
other districts so following that
 
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.470 align:start position:0%
other districts so following that
um

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
we have 25 total districts
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
18 base
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
and seven floateral districts and that
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
is a total of 38 seats
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
district one is farmington middleton
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
milton and new durham for four seats
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
district two
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
is i'm very pleased to say
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
stratford for one seat
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is a new town that gets its own
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
base district
 
01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.630 align:start position:0%
base district
and

01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
is no longer connected by
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
a point
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
on a square with another town in order
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
to create a larger district
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
district three is barrington with two
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
seats which is the same as the existing
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
district and district four is lee with
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
one seat again the same as the existing
 
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
one seat again the same as the existing
district

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
durham and madbury
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
have five seats again the same as the
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
existing district
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
in rochester each of the wards and there
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
are six wards have one seat
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
the same as the existing district
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
in dover there's a slight difference in
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
dover wards one through four
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
each have one seat which is the same as
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
the existing district
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
but also we add dove award five with one
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
seat and dove award six with one seat
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
where in the past they had been combined
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
with other jurisdictions
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
rollins ford and somersworth
 
01:03:08.319 --> 01:03:09.270 align:start position:0%
rollins ford and somersworth
have

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.230 align:start position:0%
have
four

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
seats together
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
and they are not combined with dover
 
01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.950 align:start position:0%
and they are not combined with dover
which

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
seems to us to be a much more fair and
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
equitable distribution of seats
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
then we have um
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
district 19 has one floaterio
 
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.630 align:start position:0%
district 19 has one floaterio
um

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
that's made up of districts one and two
 
01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:36.789 align:start position:0%
that's made up of districts one and two
um

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
district 22 was one float
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
the 21 has one floateria which is
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
rochester wards one and two
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
district 22 has won filterial of
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
rochester wards three and four
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh district three is one floaterial of
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
rochester wards five and six
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
district 24 has two seats
 
01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.589 align:start position:0%
district 24 has two seats
floateria

01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
floateria
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
composed of dove awards one five and six
 
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
composed of dove awards one five and six
and

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
the last district is 25 with a two-seat
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
floaterall composed of dove awards two
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
and four
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
this map separates dover
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
somersworth and rollinsford something
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
that has been an issue
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
in the existing map
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it keeps rochester separate from
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
other towns in any base or floaterial
 
01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:30.630 align:start position:0%
other towns in any base or floaterial
district

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it separates as i said before
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
stratford from new durham in the base
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
district which currently only connects
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
geographically at a single point
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
my distinguished colleague
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
who was the clerk of judiciary committee
 
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.589 align:start position:0%
who was the clerk of judiciary committee
is

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
listening to this and is secretly or
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
publicly cheering that we have
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
recognized that stratfor should be there
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
on its own
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
the total deviation um for the proposed
 
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
map is
 
01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.349 align:start position:0%
map is
9.85

01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
9.85
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
questions representative mcguire
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
just one minor correction
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
rollinsford is not separate from
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
somersworth it's combined with it it's
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
the same district that the other map has
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
if they are separate from dover that's
 
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.309 align:start position:0%
if they are separate from dover that's
correct

01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
this has to do with i think is referred
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
to as the ox oxford
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
comma or is it the cambridge comma
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
in that um
 
01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.069 align:start position:0%
in that um
uh

01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
by that statement those two
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
are together and then dover is and the
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
and without the comma makes things
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
confusing exactly i was just wanted to
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
clarify that point because a lot of
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about that at the
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
all right that's
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
16 a and 16 b
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh so we have 17 a and b and 18 a and we
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
are going to take a short break we will
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
be back here
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.829 align:start position:0%
 
specifically

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
the city and
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
and then i but i
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
saw one of our maps where lebanon was
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.199 --> 01:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
i know well i just wanted to let you
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
know but it seems to go more smoothly
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
until three days later
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right christina let's get going
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
all right we are on
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
all right thank you everybody for that
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh recess which of course like all good
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
recesses went longer than i said it
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
would i apologize it is now 11 15.
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh we left off with 16 we are
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
now on 17.
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
this is sullivan county
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and i am going to turn to
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
for sullivan
 
01:20:34.639 --> 01:20:36.070 align:start position:0%
for sullivan
17

01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.750 align:start position:0%
17
b

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
b
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
sullivan has challenging geography
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
one of the first thing you notice is the
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
two largest municipalities by far
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
clermont and newport like a wall down
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
the middle it is challenging to make
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
better numbers by combining northern and
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
southern towns
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we heard was that
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
grantham should have its own
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative they are just a smidge
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
over a one percent deviation they should
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
this plan does that
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh we heard
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
multiple people testify that sunapee
 
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
should have its own representative they
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
are under three percent off from being
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
perfect this plan gives them their own
 
01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
perfect this plan gives them their own
representative

01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
we also heard that claremont should stay
 
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.950 align:start position:0%
we also heard that claremont should stay
together

01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
this plan does that there's literally no
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
change to the voting districts in
 
01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
change to the voting districts in
claremont

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
separating them from the towns
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
people know a lot about headline news
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
but what happens at the county level is
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
our pitched battles are over whether the
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
fall mountain food shelf gets the county
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
grant or the claremont soup kitchen does
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
local transportation issues the city and
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
the towns often have widely disparate
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
viewpoints on that
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
if i represented both claremont and one
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the towns when we had one of our
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
biggest battles over the local buses i
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
would have had to have asked myself
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
which of my constituents do i ignore
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
because they're on opposite sides so
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
this plan makes good sense that way
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
what stays the same
 
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the county currently
 
01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.550 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the county currently
charlestown

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
charlestown
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
all of those orange towns that you see
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the plan
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
and goshen
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
are one district without unity um and
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
afflicterial and then the orange ones
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
plus goshen would without unity would be
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
a separate district the only change
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
there at all is that goshen and unity
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
are swapped
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
this makes good sense because newport
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
and goshen have very close ties goshen
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
kids go to newport schools a lot of
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
people live in goshen work in newport
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's right down the road
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
that leaves some things to deal with um
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
oh another thing
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
the last criticism of the current state
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
of affairs that we had was a giant
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
floaterial ignore the colors but notice
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
where claremont is now start right above
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
that those towns are on the vermont
 
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
that those towns are on the vermont
border

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
border
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
go all the way right to the merrimack
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
county border
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
down and then come back under klama
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
almost back to the vermont border that's
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
currently a nine town fliterial nobody
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
likes it
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the uh we heard the representative that
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
represents it doesn't like it
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't like it it's it's just
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the fallout from dealing with the
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
numbers last time so what this plan does
 
01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:25.910 align:start position:0%
numbers last time so what this plan does
is

01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
we have smaller footerials there are two
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
no way to do sullivan without them
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
they are comprised of towns we don't use
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
claremont wards peel it apart and piece
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
those anywhere
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i think this makes good sense the
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to call the color it's
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
kind of pink at the top
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
that is a product of carving grantham
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
out for its own rep and then making
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
sense of what remains
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
people may question whether or not
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
newport and cornish are contiguous
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
in sound records going back many decades
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
apparently when perambulation happens
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
when the town officials are supposed to
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
walk the borders they would meet out
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
there and have lunch that was pretty
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
cool there's a marker in the ground out
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
there and one property owner
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
owns land in three of the towns so that
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly meets the definition
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
is it ideal
 
01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
is it ideal
no

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
but i think that the other
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
considerations i cited at the beginning
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
are the important ones and the
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
priorities and doing this was necessary
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that overall deviation is
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i always like to hear about
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
perambulation i have done a few myself
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
they're quite an exercise
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe we have tried to get there
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
have been attempts to get rid of it um
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
here at the state house a couple of
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
times over the years and it never
 
01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.669 align:start position:0%
times over the years and it never
succeeds

01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay questions for representative steve
 
01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and if there are none i think we are
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to representative marjorie smith
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um the smiths have
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
cornered the market on sullivan county
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we agree on the underlying
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
point that it is unbelievably difficult
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:25:27.669 --> 01:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
sullivan county you wonder why it
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know on the one hand this
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
and on the other hand that
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
um and some of the changes that we've
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
made are the same changes that in april
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
the same changes that um my colleague
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
made but but not all of them
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
and again we're trying to keep these
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
districts as small as possible
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't it just doesn't
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily work
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
i mean we can end up with a very good
 
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.189 align:start position:0%
i mean we can end up with a very good
deviation

01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
range of 3.73 total which is is
 
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
range of 3.73 total which is is
wonderful

01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
wonderful
but

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
there are problems getting to it we have
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
sixth base and two floateral and we have
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
a total of 13 seats
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
district one is cornish and plainfield
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
district 2 is grantham one seat this is
 
01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.629 align:start position:0%
district 2 is grantham one seat this is
a

01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
new town that gets its own base district
 
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.709 align:start position:0%
new town that gets its own base district
and

01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
the other map that was just proposed
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
does exactly the same thing
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
district three is springfield and
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
sunapee with one seat
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
district four
 
01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
district four
is

01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
claremont and croydon
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
with three seats it keeps claremont
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
together which is difficult to
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish but not claremont alone
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to say
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
district 5 is charleston newport and
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
unity for three seats
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
six is acworth goshen langdon leemster
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
and washington for one seat
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
the floaterials uh
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
district seven is a one
 
01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
district seven is a one
seat

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
seat
 
01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.669 align:start position:0%
seat
floaterial

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
floaterial
 
01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:23.030 align:start position:0%
floaterial
um

01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%

and playing field and
 
01:27:30.719 --> 01:27:33.270 align:start position:0%
and playing field and
um

01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%

uh
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
for the float for some
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
where point me
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
oh charleston cornish

unity
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay is that it
 
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.350 align:start position:0%
okay is that it
um

01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%

01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
so it's tough
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
we agree on that we did the best that we
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
can do we'd be happy to have some
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions for
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
getting it better and i'm delighted for
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
grantham that we both agree we all agree
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
that that's a good place to have a seat
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh because representative
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
smith had papers the
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
the bigger float i believe is acworth
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
claremont corydon goshen langdon lobster
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
springfield centipede and washington
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
which is a mouthful no wonder i couldn't
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
say exactly that's happy to help out so
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
all right any questions for either of
 
01:29:04.310 --> 01:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
the smiths
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
on sullivan county
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
ask a question um i noticed when
 
01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.030 align:start position:0%
ask a question um i noticed when
representative

01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
steven smith was speaking about
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
claremont and keeping it together the
 
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.470 align:start position:0%
claremont and keeping it together the
differences

01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
and we tried to do that as well but that
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to hold in stratfor county
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
when we talked about rochester and dover
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i guess this is really more of a
 
01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:29.350 align:start position:0%
and i guess this is really more of a
question

01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
i guess for representative turcotte was
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
there a way to do that to keep dover and
 
01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
there a way to do that to keep dover and
stratfor

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
stratfor
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry dover and rochester together
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
without the
 
01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.189 align:start position:0%
without the
um

01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
including border towns or you know
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm just asking that question
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
because i know we were all trying to do
 
01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:52.070 align:start position:0%
because i know we were all trying to do
that

01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm backtracking i was just
 
01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.229 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm backtracking i was just
listening

01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
listening
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
no that's fine okay i think in just
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
about every county we could come up with
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
variations of
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
putting this town with that
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
town or this town with that town ward it
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the same in every county
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
could have been done in stratford i'm
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's some possibility of
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
doing that that doesn't necessarily mean
 
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.110 align:start position:0%
doing that that doesn't necessarily mean
that

01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
that option is any better than any
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith please
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think what i said too is
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's something we want to do but
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're prevented but like like
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
keane there was no way to make keen its
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
own thing so you had two options you
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
could peel off the wards and put them
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
with other things or just add the one i
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the talent was um to
 
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.550 align:start position:0%
don't remember what the talent was um to
it

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you everybody knows about me and i
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
that just seems to work out that way
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
a good trade-off
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
sullivan county but others
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
to the extent we can remember
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
because it has been a lot of paperwork
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing any so we're
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to move on to the last map on the
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
agenda for today
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
number 18 the whole state the
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
congressional district we have a few
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
more pages to this because of course
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's every community listed in the
 
01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.750 align:start position:0%
it's every community listed in the
paperwork

01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
paperwork
and

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
why don't we
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
start with is it one
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the congressional
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
district it will look
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
it will look a lot like the map as it
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
currently exists
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh goals here uh were to keep both
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
congressional districts
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh in a way to remain competitive
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
mirroring the state as a whole
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
there have been minimal changes in
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
population between the existing
 
01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
population between the existing
districts

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
since the last census
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
so the map should also make minimal
 
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.510 align:start position:0%
so the map should also make minimal
changes

01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
the existing congressional districts
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
have remained very very similar for the
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
last 14 decades 140 years and the only
 
01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
last 14 decades 140 years and the only
changes

01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
that have been made to balance
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh in the the only real changes that
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
have been made over the last 140 years
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
have been changes uh to balance the
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
population between the two districts
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
as the maps are currently drawn as of
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
the 2020 elections the population of cd1
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
is 17
 
01:32:48.639 --> 01:32:51.030 align:start position:0%
is 17
945

01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
945
 
01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.390 align:start position:0%
945
people

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.669 align:start position:0%
people
larger

01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
than congressional district number two
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
so in order to balance the populations
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the two districts this proposed map
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
moves a single town hempstead
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
population 8998
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
from cd1 to cd2
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
the resulting difference in population
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
is just 51 people now between the two
 
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
is just 51 people now between the two
districts

01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
this proposed map continues to keep both
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
districts competitive and continues with
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
the long history
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
of not making changes in the districts
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
other than balancing population
 
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.270 align:start position:0%
other than balancing population
thanks

01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
and the print is really small nothing
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
that you had any control of
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
so can you just point out which blue
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
spot is hampstead
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
if anybody can
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
madam sherman's hampstead's in the
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
southern tier well i knew it's in the
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
southern tier so it's going to be next
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
to deary
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a wonderful town madam chairman
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
hampstead is a wonderful town
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
all right i'm seeing like somebody just
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
hit a goal down there with
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's like a square except that it opens
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
up like
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
does that make sense so somebody just
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
hold up a map and point to the general
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
area that it is bottom right it's this
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
one so is it a light blue on this map or
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
a dark blue
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
white blue all right so it's a little
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
light blue that goes just like
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative simpson said duh
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying tada here i am i am
 
01:34:41.679 --> 01:34:42.870 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying tada here i am i am
hamstad

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
hamstad
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm moving
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.239 --> 01:34:55.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
questions for representative wilhelm
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
the other proposal 18b
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman thank you um
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
this map is a another congressional
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
district map that has a deviation of 0.0
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
percent uh
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
it's a deviation from zero is 88 uh 88
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and 189 in the other because if you take
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
the state's population divided by two
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
you get a not whole number
 
01:35:30.239 --> 01:35:31.270 align:start position:0%
you get a not whole number
so

01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
things that we considered were we look
 
01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.109 align:start position:0%
things that we considered were we look
at

01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
the the current way
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
that the the maps are situated which is
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
that you have let's take my state rep
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
district not that we consider state rep
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
districts inside
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
of other districts we didn't do that for
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
county commissioners but i represent
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
southern manchester in the town of
 
01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:56.629 align:start position:0%
southern manchester in the town of
litchfield

01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
manchester is in cd1 and litchfield is
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
in cd2
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's because over the years as
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledged over 140 years these
 
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
acknowledged over 140 years these
districts

01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
have grown and mutated
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
the southern tiers continue to be
 
01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
the southern tiers continue to be
divided

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
divided
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
in an attempt as he says to balance it
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
out which ends up with a district
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
as it is today
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
with its
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
jagged edges and its
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
inclines and
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
i look at it and i say okay
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
why can we not put the majority of
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
manchester southern tier back together
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i say okay we say okay
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
let's get hudson
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
wyndham litchfield
 
01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.629 align:start position:0%
wyndham litchfield
pelham

01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
pelham
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
and salem and atkinson back together
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
with the rest of rockingham county
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the rest of southern hillsboro with
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
the exception of nashua because of
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
population differences
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
and as representative wilhelm said the
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
population differences from the existing
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
congressional districts were already off
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
by you have the exact number but let's
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
say 18 000 for the sake of simplicity
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
that means that cd1
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
already had to give
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
9 000
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
people over to cd2
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
and then we bring in the other southern
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
tier towns that i just mentioned
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
so now we must balance that out
 
01:37:16.639 --> 01:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
so now we must balance that out
and

01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
the thing about what makes congressional
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
district mapping difficult
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire gets two
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
congressional seats
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
we also use the component method we this
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
committee voted unanimously that we do
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
not break up towns right we don't put
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
half of dairy window one and half of
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
darien to another so because of that
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
you're moving large puzzle pieces
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
and as we know
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
different towns have different density
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
populations so when you move the
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
residents of hamps of oxygen hampstead
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
of salem windham
 
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.709 align:start position:0%
of salem windham
litchfield

01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
pelham and atkinson over
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
you have to backfill that
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
and there's really
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
only one there's only really one place
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
and that is the densely populated towns
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
of portsmouth
 
01:38:08.239 --> 01:38:09.270 align:start position:0%
of portsmouth
dover

01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
dover
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
durham and rochester
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that is that is how this map was
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
arrived to
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
it meets the constitutional requirements
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
of one man one vote
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
88 people
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
it meets the constitutional requirements
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire it is
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
perfectly contiguous
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.310 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
questions

01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:50.950 align:start position:0%
representative smith
marjorie

01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative i can't i can't
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
let's try this am i on now thank you um
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
using the vernacular can you tell me why
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
we don't adopt the principle
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
of if it ain't broke
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't fix it
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
when we can by moving one town
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
and keeping everything else basically
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
the way it has worked well over the
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
years with districts going back and
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
forth in terms of
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we are a purple state
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
why would we
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
do something as dramatic as this and
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
although it is true
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
that every town
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
in each color whether it's light blue or
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
dark blue does touch another one
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
having um
 
01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:52.470 align:start position:0%
having um
this

01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
construction just come up through the
 
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.910 align:start position:0%
construction just come up through the
middle

01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
middle
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
01:39:57.679 --> 01:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
of the state
um

01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
seems a little strange to me
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
in order to get from my town
 
01:40:11.669 --> 01:40:11.679 align:start position:0%
of durham to other towns in that
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
district you'd have to cross
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
the width
 
01:40:17.119 --> 01:40:17.990 align:start position:0%
the width
of

01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
of the other district it does
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
i go back to my initial question if it
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
ain't broke why fix it um so a couple of
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
things to that point representative the
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
first is the premise is that it's not
 
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.550 align:start position:0%
first is the premise is that it's not
broken

01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
broken
 
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
broken
um

01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
my definition is i wanted to see the
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
rest of the southern tier put back
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
together i consider that broken
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
to your point about driving from one
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
part of the district to the other i've
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
heard this one a lot
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to propose a road trip
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
from salem to berlin
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
under the current map
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
you will start in cd2
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
you will go into cd1 up 93 then you go
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
back into cd2 then you go back into cd1
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
and then you go back into cd2
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's a trip from salem to berlin north
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
to south
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
we have two congressional districts
 
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
there is no map that you can make that
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
where you will drive from one part of
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
the state to the other
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
will not come in and out of a
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
congressional seat it's just by virtue
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the state's population
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
so i i enjoy the road trip theory um if
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
you're using the road chip theory then
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair am i on or off
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
mike put it closer yeah
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's your mic
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
yes okay um thank you madam chair and
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative so if
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding you correctly
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
your sole
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
criteria for changing this map was to
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
make sure those southern tier towns
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
are back connected with manchester that
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
was your main criteria and in order to
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
do that it meant
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
taking a whole bunch of towns
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
out of the district along the seacoast
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that or the
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know basically the sea coast and up
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
into uh maine is that what you're
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
telling me um no ma'am chairman i'm
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
stepping ships you know no
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative um as i said beginning my
 
01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.590 align:start position:0%
representative um as i said beginning my
main

01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
main
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
my main criteria was create was for the
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee was to create a district that
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
met the constitutional requirements of
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
the united states of america and the new
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire state constitution after that
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
obviously a variety of other factors
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
come into place i do represent the
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
southern tier of new hampshire part of
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
it not all of it
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
so it was close to home for me and as
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who currently represents two
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
congressional districts in the southern
 
01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
congressional districts in the southern
tier

01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
tier
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
it was definitely a factor of
 
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.990 align:start position:0%
it was definitely a factor of
consideration

01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:53.119 --> 01:42:56.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
weber in a minute maybe i'll go to
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm and maybe
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative berry i'm i'm finding
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
this if it ain't broke
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh don't fix it argument sort of curious
 
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh don't fix it argument sort of curious
because

01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you determine whether
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's broke or not i mean are you
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
determining whether it's broke or not by
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
the partisan result
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
um because it would seem to me that
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be the only measurable criteria to
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
make that determination
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then the other question i had was
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm i had no idea
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
these districts sort of had this type of
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
a line for so long do you know how
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
this type of a line was developed in the
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
first instance
 
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.030 align:start position:0%
first instance
so

01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
and then maybe
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
could i answer since i was the one who
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
said if it ain't broke
 
01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.590 align:start position:0%
said if it ain't broke
um

01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put that burden on
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else if i could respond to that
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
and what i meant i believe
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm referred to the
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
fact that it had worked well but go
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
ahead representative smith i'll defer to
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
you as i see representative wilhelm
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
nodding um i'm sorry i missed that
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
i i said it because
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
the population difference was 18
 
01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.790 align:start position:0%
the population difference was 18
000

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
in a state with
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
1.3 million people and so it meant
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the smallest possible possible
 
01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.510 align:start position:0%
that the smallest possible possible
adjustment

01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
could result in the district numbers
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
being evened
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the smallest number of towns and
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
cities having to make any changes
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it was perhaps it was too glib of me
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
to say it in that way
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
but what i meant is a very small
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
adjustment in this case one town could
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
give us the right number with the right
 
01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.310 align:start position:0%
give us the right number with the right
deviation

01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
and in that case um
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
i thought the simplest approach was the
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
best approach all right thank you
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
because then that's consistent with i
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
believe representative bergeron's
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
comments yesterday about not wanting to
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
confuse voters by changing the districts
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
too much because i think under the logic
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
that you are just doing a population
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
would allow you to draw a line pretty
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
much in any direction through the state
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
when you only have two districts
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
but representative wilhelm if you wanted
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
to add anything to that question or as
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the origin of the original district
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
um i think the origins of the original
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
district i think we should go to
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh house research i think we should we
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
should look it up no i just thought you
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
might know because you happen to know it
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
was 140 i had no idea no i just know
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
that there have been minor changes made
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
over the last several redistricting
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
cycles um
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know when we talk about the the
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
districts as they exist right now we've
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
seen pretty competitive congressional
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
elections where voters have
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know a clear choice between
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh the two major parties and i think
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately i think that serves
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
our democracy pretty well
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ross do you
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
have an answer to either one of those
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions yes ma'am chairman i'm i'm not
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
as i'm not i'm not going to hold myself
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
up as an expert into the 140 year
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
history of the congressional districts
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
but in my research um and this is cited
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
in multiple websites you can go look
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that manchester and
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
nashua were split intentionally
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
to dilute the catholic vote and the
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
white ethnic vote
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
please go look it up so
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
it happened many many many many many
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
it would say from my understanding it's
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
something that if any
 
01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:46.070 align:start position:0%
something that if any
elected

01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
elected
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
any elected body attempted to do today
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
would be ruled grossly unconstitutional
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
but it's one of those things that
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
derives when you have something that old
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
is you run into things like that where
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
you have
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
lines drawn to dilute religious
 
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.270 align:start position:0%
lines drawn to dilute religious
populations

01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
which by the way is not something that
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
we would support obviously the map that
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
this side of the committee is bringing
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
forward still splits up manchester and
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
nashua but i assure you it is not to
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
dilute the catholic vote
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i assure you
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
that our maps were not
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
drawn to dilute any one particular group
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
of persons vote as they stand now either
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
whatever the historical
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
reality was
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
what i want to ask is we i keep hearing
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
the phrase keep the southern tier
 
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.590 align:start position:0%
the phrase keep the southern tier
together

01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
and as i'm looking at this map i'm
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
wondering what the heck the southern
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
tier is because
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh if we look at the most southern
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
border there are about nine or ten towns
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
that are abutting massachusetts
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
which don't seem to be part of the
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
southern tier
 
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh and yet the southern tier goes almost
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
halfway up the map into territory that's
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
for those of us who do live in the
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state seems fairly
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
far north
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just wondering about the fact
 
01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:20.229 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just wondering about the fact
that

01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
at least half of the lower third
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes madam chairman
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
um perhaps i chose my words poorly um
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
the concept is still the same i wanted
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
to bring hudson
 
01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.229 align:start position:0%
to bring hudson
pelham

01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
pelham
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
litchfield salem and windham back
 
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.310 align:start position:0%
litchfield salem and windham back
together

01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
into one seat with the towns that they
 
01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
into one seat with the towns that they
neighbor

01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
but you still have to consider the
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
population as a whole
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
right so it's just it's just one of
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
those things is when you look at a map
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
people want to believe that somehow the
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
population is evenly dispersed across
 
01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
the entire state that is not the reality
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm and i live in a
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
city that has a hundred and fifteen
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
thousand people
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
geography based geography wise we touch
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
towns that are the same amount of
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
landmass that have a population a third
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
of that and you can imagine going across
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
the state and across the southern tier
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
the sort of problems that that creates
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
and as i said in the beginning my goal
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
was to bring the towns i just mentioned
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
together and i we had to find a way to
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up madam chair follow-up
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative i would just say that
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
backfilling towns together by also
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
joining together towns that are as
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
disparate as the ones that have been
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
joined in this plan
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh seems objectionable to me and i thank
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
chair representative barry um
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask the similar question
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
that representative weber asked that
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
essentially your proposal
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
reduces the cohesiveness of the southern
 
01:50:05.199 --> 01:50:06.229 align:start position:0%
reduces the cohesiveness of the southern
tier

01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
tier
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
since under your proposal
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
everything from nashua to the western
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
border is now the southern tier where as
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
previously it was started further
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
further east but be that as it may you
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
you said that you wanted to uh bring
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
hudson windham and salem together again
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious as to
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
how they were ever together in the first
 
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:28.950 align:start position:0%
how they were ever together in the first
place

01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.830 align:start position:0%
place
um

01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
i said again i'm sorry i did i didn't
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
mean again if i did say again
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying i'm not saying i didn't
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
say it i don't recall saying it but i
 
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring them together okay and
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
then my question is
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
why did you want to do that because once
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
we know in redistricting once you make
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
one change that has a cascading effect
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and by putting those large towns
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
together you created this cascading
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
effect which
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
creates a a district right in the middle
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
of the state with uh the other district
 
01:50:56.159 --> 01:50:56.950 align:start position:0%
of the state with uh the other district
and

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
enveloping it or enveloping it on both
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
sides is kind of bizarre but be that as
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
it may i just if you could answer the
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
question why you chose to make that big
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
change create the cascade effect and and
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
in effect change 18 000 people instead
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
of um you know the the 10 000 that a one
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
town change would have made i'm correct
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
and remember representative this is the
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
this is the majorities committee map
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's not my map
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but the
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
they get the member we're dealing once
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
again we're dealing with the population
 
01:51:28.639 --> 01:51:29.589 align:start position:0%
again we're dealing with the population
right

01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
and western rockingham
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
and south and eastern hillsborough
 
01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.149 align:start position:0%
and south and eastern hillsborough
county

01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
repres in my opinion up until certain
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
point of rockingham represent what i
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
consider the the southern tier
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire the distinct region of
 
01:51:44.159 --> 01:51:44.950 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire the distinct region of
it

01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:47.109 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
they have been they have been driven
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
further and further apart the map that
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
your party has proposed further
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
separates them by removing hampstead
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
those sort of things are going to
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
continue as the population shifts
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of of priorities and
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
these towns have been apart for some
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
time and i think it's time that all that
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
area gets put back that not put back
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
together but put gets put together
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair mine is more of a
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
comment is that all right sure um
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
which is i'm from the seacoast region of
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
the state and i just want to point out
 
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
the state and i just want to point out
that

01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
um this map presented by the majority
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
really breaks up the seacoast that has
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
been together in the first congressional
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
district um the towns of well city of
 
01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:39.030 align:start position:0%
district um the towns of well city of
portsmouth

01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and durham and other towns surrounding
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
it have um a great affinity and uh
 
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.070 align:start position:0%
it have um a great affinity and uh
shared

01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
not um
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
well maybe most importantly but at least
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
greatly um in each in economy together
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
they have a shared um
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of things in common but
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
economically we talk a lot about the
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
seacoast as opposed to just the towns
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the seacoast so just to be clear
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
putting back together some of the towns
 
01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the southern tier breaks up the
 
01:53:11.109 --> 01:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
region of the seacoast
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay i saw another hand over here that i
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
hadn't heard from representative lane
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
um actually i was going to bring up the
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
same point that
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative simpson brought up which
 
01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.629 align:start position:0%
representative simpson brought up which
was

01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
you are breaking up an entire area of
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
the state with this map the seacoast
 
01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.350 align:start position:0%
the state with this map the seacoast
area

01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
and when you look at it um
 
01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:35.589 align:start position:0%
and when you look at it um
i

01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
there are some i don't understand how
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
you can say it's the southern region
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
when there are towns that are
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
southern of the northernmost
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
parts of the state and the logic escapes
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
me and i know this is mathematically
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
driven but we also want to take into
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't see how
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
the seacoast area and the
 
01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
have the same concerns as keene and
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
plymouth and all these others
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
that are included here and it it's
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
it is it's a question of why was that
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
not taken into consideration that you
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
are breaking up an entire area
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
of this of the state
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize representative
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
smith steve smith
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so um i live
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
seven miles from the vermont border and
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking a lot about
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the southern right
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
corner of the state and i'd kind of like
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
to offer my perspective and maybe it
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
will put some of those in context i
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
think representative barry
 
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.750 align:start position:0%
think representative barry
were

01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
picking on the word that he used
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
southern cheer and then trying to define
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
that he listed the communities and agree
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
or disagree with his strategy i think he
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
was fairly specific so for me
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to stop picking on the words
 
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.790 align:start position:0%
i'd like to stop picking on the words
and

01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
just to accept his argument for which
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
communities he wanted to put back
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
together and i say that as someone who
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
will never get a good solution out of
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
these maps
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the town of webster which is
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
probably 20 miles from the vermont
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
border has a traffic light it's a
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
blinking one but by god they got one
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's the area i represent
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
my congressman also represents nashua
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of sense does that make or
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
salem or colebrook
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
you can literally drive through one of
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
the most populous cities in the state i
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't know is nashville the most
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
populous it's the second most popular
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
manchester's probably the most populous
 
01:55:32.070 --> 01:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay either way second most populous
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
city in the state
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
all the way to the canadian border from
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and you pass through where
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
i live
 
01:55:38.719 --> 01:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
i live
so

01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
maybe for me
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
the community arguments
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
they just don't swing that much weight
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
because cd2
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
is and always will be if we do it this
 
01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:51.830 align:start position:0%
is and always will be if we do it this
way

01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
the most screwed up district there is
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
now while i'm criticizing i tried doing
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
congressional maps myself to get what i
 
01:55:58.400 --> 01:55:59.430 align:start position:0%
congressional maps myself to get what i
wanted

01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
and i i don't want to be in the district
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
with nashua i don't want to be in a
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
district with salem i don't want that
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
can i make a map of mostly smaller towns
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
no i didn't it was going great and then
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
i think what happens when you make these
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
maps as you get to the end and you have
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
that unacceptable level uh number of
 
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
people that you just can't get rid of
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
without starting at the very beginning i
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time doing that so for me
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
i i accept representative barry's
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
argument he has a rationale for what he
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
did you can disagree with it but he has
 
01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:32.550 align:start position:0%
did you can disagree with it but he has
one

01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
and recognizing that if you fix that
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're still never going to solve my
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
that's just how it is
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
i heard something that representative
 
01:56:55.510 --> 01:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
barry said and i'm concerned
 
01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:56.550 align:start position:0%
barry said and i'm concerned
that

01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
when not be fair to one of our
 
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.070 align:start position:0%
when not be fair to one of our
colleagues

01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
unless i miss her representative you
 
01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:04.950 align:start position:0%
unless i miss her representative you
said

01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
this isn't your map and if that's so
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
then i don't think you should have to
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
take the slings and arrows
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
and that and that concerns me i mean i
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
then want to know whose map it is but i
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
i i heard that comment and i
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
i felt bad for you
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
first of all representative thank you um
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes drawing the short straw
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
means that you draw the short straw um
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
everyone uh i'll just pipe in in that i
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
was contacted by somebody who apparently
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
got the map on
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
the pdf file and saw my name on it and
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
attributed it to me
 
01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
so depending on the moment in time i
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
guess we're attributing maps to whoever
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
is the closest name go ahead as we've
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
conducted these work sessions um
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative marjorie smith i'm only
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
using your first name because
 
01:57:53.589 --> 01:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith is here um
 
01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:54.709 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith is here um
but

01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
he doesn't want to be confused with me i
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know as as we've been doing these um
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
we've been doing and your side has been
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
doing as well one one representative
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
presenting one map um so
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
once again short straw i'm sure you know
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
i knew in this one when i drew this one
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
that no one would be interested in this
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that everybody was really here to
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
talk about the state rep seats and the
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
county commissioner seats and that this
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
was kind of begun after thought
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was a joke we can laugh
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair with all due
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
respect to representative stephen smith
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
no one has answered my question which is
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
why would you want to separate an entire
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
section of the state
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
away and divide it up
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
in connection when you don't have to
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative lane i i think i'll come
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
back to the legal principle that you
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't always get the answer you want to
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
a question but you get the answer
 
01:58:50.719 --> 01:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
a question but you get the answer
so

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative berry i'll go to that but
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
i will also point out that there are no
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
defined sections of the state
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have a state we have to create two
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
congressional districts we have health
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
and human service districts which are
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
different from county districts which
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
are different from town lines which are
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
different of course from the lines
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
within them so when one talks about a
 
01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.830 align:start position:0%
within them so when one talks about a
section

01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
it is hard to do that without defining
 
01:59:19.109 --> 01:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
a section and i know that representative
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
simpson referred to the seacoast
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
area but i'm sure that there are towns
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
that uh might say they are or are not i
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
know that for years i have gotten in
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
discussions with people about what
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
states are in new england
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure many of you have
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
been into that as to whether there are
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
four or five or six states in new
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
england representative barry i'm to that
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
point madam chairman
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite things about living
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is that if you ask
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from the northern part of the
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
state if they live in the north country
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
the answer is of course i live in the
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
north country until you talk to somebody
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
who lives in the town just north of them
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
and they say no no i live in the north
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
country that's not the north country
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
down below
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's all relative but the current map
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
that your party has brought forward does
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
in fact split up regions of the state um
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's just once again going back
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the populations
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
we have for whatever reason prioritized
 
02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:16.070 align:start position:0%
we have for whatever reason prioritized
the

02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
southeast corner forever
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's time that some of these
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
other towns and sections of the state
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
get put together instead of just one
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
section you're trying to balance the
 
02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:28.390 align:start position:0%
section you're trying to balance the
population

02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
population
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm thank you madam
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
chair i just want to point out and i i
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact numbers on me but
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
it appears that approximately
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
25 about a quarter of the state is
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
moving from one congressional district
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
to the other and this is it's a pretty
 
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.109 align:start position:0%
to the other and this is it's a pretty
dramatic

02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
02:00:47.119 --> 02:00:48.149 align:start position:0%
dramatic
difference

02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh from the the current maps and
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
i took congressional elections when i
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
was in grad school at unh and my
 
02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.550 align:start position:0%
was in grad school at unh and my
professor

02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
professor
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
dante scala tweeted out this morning he
 
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.270 align:start position:0%
dante scala tweeted out this morning he
said

02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.350 align:start position:0%
said
uh

02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
that he and his research assistant had
 
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.109 align:start position:0%
that he and his research assistant had
been

02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
drawing maps and they could not find
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh they could not draw a map that had
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
more partisan advantage than this one
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
right here so i just want to state that
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
for the record it's concerning to me
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's a massive overhaul of what we have
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
and it's very concerning to me
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry you know
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
to that point um we discussed yesterday
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe representative would like to
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
point out where is the legal standard to
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
consider the current map it does not
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
exist the courts have ruled against it
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact this very committee
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday that it was not a
 
02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.910 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday that it was not a
factor

02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
factor
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
we i believe we talked about i believe
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
your side was talking about drawing
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
districts around incumbents and we
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
refuted that no we didn't no oh no
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair and i don't think that's
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
what we were saying yesterday
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative i'm sorry that i feel
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
like i've been misrepresented in that i
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
simply made a comment yesterday
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not a political scientist and i
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
haven't been part of this whole
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
deliberation that you're doing but i do
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
know that when it comes time to run for
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
office there are people who tell me um a
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
number that goes along with my district
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
it might be r plus three
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
or d plus one
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
or deep neutral
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
when we are
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
you both sides were
 
02:02:36.639 --> 02:02:37.350 align:start position:0%
you both sides were
con

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
con
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
configuring this congressional map
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
were you using numbers like that to help
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
you make your decision
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
oh representative lynn
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
sorry what i
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
i was not in involved in the details
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
because of of the drawing of the match
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
because i have to tell you i don't
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
unlike some of my colleagues i assume on
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
both sides i don't know you know if you
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
ask me if you asked me before this
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
exercise let's say was conway a
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
republican or a democratic leaning town
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
i frankly i think i would have said
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
republican i've since learned that it's
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
not it's actually a democratic leading
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
town so i didn't and that's sort of my
 
02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.629 align:start position:0%
town so i didn't and that's sort of my
ignorance

02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
ignorance
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
generally now if you ask me my town of
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
windham sure wyndham is a
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
republican-leaning town i ran you know i
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
ran in windham so i i understand that
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
but i guess
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
i guess what
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
if if
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
your question is
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
were political considerations something
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
that were in the mix
 
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
of course they were that's part of and
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know that that this is a political
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
process as the supreme court has
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
said repeatedly both the new hampshire
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court and the u.s supreme court
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is a political process that's why
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's done by the legislature so was that
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
something that was taken into account of
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
course it was
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
follow up before uh representative lane
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going back to representative wilhelm
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
who said that he felt the current map
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh was a very good map and
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
produced good results and i i i know i'm
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
sort of paraphrasing but you you went
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
back to talk about how you felt as a
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
base district to work from the current
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
cd produced results that indicated they
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
were good so i and i'm paraphrasing
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm coming back to you for
 
02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:35.109 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm coming back to you for
that

02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
i think i talked about the
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
competitiveness competitive
 
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.390 align:start position:0%
competitiveness competitive
competitiveness

02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
competitiveness
 
02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
serves our democracy well because then
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
it's a battle of ideas between the two
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
parties the two candidates who will
 
02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
parties the two candidates who will
emerge

02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
emerge
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
as the nominees for the general
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
elections i think that's a good thing
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so was competitiveness a factor that
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
you used in regards to the composition
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the maps and if so how did you
 
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
measure it
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
competit i think
 
02:05:02.229 --> 02:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
them to be competitive i know the two
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
districts that they're you know
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
consistently called by the
 
02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:07.589 align:start position:0%
consistently called by the
the

02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know the the two parties they say
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
compete in
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire you know in both cd1
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
and cd2 cycle after cycle so what have
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
the results been in cd1 and cd2 since
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
the last redistricting to show that
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're competitive
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh i'd have to look back but i think i
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
think you could look at the results and
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there have been
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
blowouts and i'm concerned that the maps
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
that are presented there are going to be
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
blowouts in both 81 and cd2 so your
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
concern is as to the results of a
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:38.719 --> 02:05:39.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
and if so did that logic carry through
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
for all of the maps
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
are we talking are we still talking
 
02:05:48.149 --> 02:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
about the congressional maps well the in
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
the first instance but if
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
competitiveness is shown by close
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
results was that a factor since that was
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
a factor are you saying it was a factor
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
in this map or you just know it to be
 
02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
in this map or you just know it to be
true

02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
true
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh i know it to be true and i think we
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
could look back at the last cycle and
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
we'll we would see that to be true so
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what my gut tells me
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just being okay
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
all right um where was the other hand
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative lane
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative webber well i'm
 
02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.270 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative webber well i'm
just

02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
sort of trying to
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
think off
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative lynn's comment
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
having been involved in redistricting 10
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.229 align:start position:0%
 
republican

02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
republican
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
house that was a legislature that was
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
three to one and um
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
they they could have controlled
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
they they had a majority that didn't
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
have to think about a gubernatorial veto
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
and they could have passed any map that
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
they wanted to but they chose
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
to keep the maps relatively
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
close to what they had been
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
and just make minor adjustments for
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
population so
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering why the majority decided
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
to take a completely different approach
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
this time
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
i would have no way of actually allowing
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
that question to be answered by anybody
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
on this committee unless they were on
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
that committee because i am not aware of
 
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.270 align:start position:0%
that committee because i am not aware of
any

02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh guidance issued
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
i i'm just asking about
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know the basis for currency were you
 
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
you know the basis for currency were you
on

02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
i think you were involved in that
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
process i'm the last
 
02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
process i'm the last
survivor

02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
survivor
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
so as the last survivor you raised the
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
question do you have any knowledge i am
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
asking about not what happened then but
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
i am using it for a basis to ask about
 
02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
what's happening now i think rep
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative barry already presented
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
that answer as to what his approach
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
was in explaining the map that's being
 
02:07:58.079 --> 02:07:59.669 align:start position:0%
was in explaining the map that's being
presented

02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:07:59.679 --> 02:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
presented
for

02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
for
uh

02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:04.149 align:start position:0%
uh
cd

02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
cd
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative lane did i i think i just
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
passed you over i apologize
 
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:09.189 align:start position:0%
passed you over i apologize
representative

02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
to representative len's point
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes it is a political process but
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday the majority
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
several times spoke
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
about how incumbents and how fair maps
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
were to be drawn ignoring the political
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
piece of it as much as possible
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
so i would just remind the majority that
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
they that was said when we were
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing maps yesterday for the house
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
i also just want to make it clear that
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
when representative piedra spoke about
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
um the the uh
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
it was in the commissioner maps that it
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
would not up you know
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
require any of the incumbents to not run
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
it was just it just happened it was not
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
an intent and i think he made that clear
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i would really appreciate it if
 
02:09:05.199 --> 02:09:06.310 align:start position:0%
and i would really appreciate it if
people

02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
would stop referring to the fact that we
 
02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:09.830 align:start position:0%
would stop referring to the fact that we
drew

02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
drew
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
maps around incumbents because i can
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
tell you there are people in our party
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
who are not happy with our maps
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take long for me to perhaps
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
not remember exactly the same something
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
that was said as the person sitting next
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
to me so
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your clarification of what
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
was said representative barry uh yes to
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
respond to representative lane um
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
that was how i interpreted his remarks
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry that that's that's how i
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
misinterpret it but i i did we did probe
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
him um and i was one of the people that
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
probed him on that point about looking
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
at the districts and the current
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
incumbents um and that's what we took
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
away from it um i would never intend to
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
mischaracterize your position um but
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
that that is that is what he took away
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
from it um uh you're saying now that
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
that that's not and that i
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted that and i take that on i
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
take that as a good faith statement
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes i'm saying that you misinterpreted
 
02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.470 align:start position:0%
yes i'm saying that you misinterpreted
it

02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
okay well then a number of us probably
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
did so we will take that
 
02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.990 align:start position:0%
did so we will take that
consideration

02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
other hands
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
earlier this summer the governor said
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
that he uh if it did pass the smell test
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
that he would reject a map
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
has anyone consulted the governor on
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
does it pass his smell test
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
i am going to say that is beyond the
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
consideration of this committee the
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
governor ex it's part of the executive
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
branch this is the legislative branch
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
the presses the press or anyone as an
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
elected member is free to contact the
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
governor's office in regards to this map
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
this is a consideration for this body
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
going forward and
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
i can
 
02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
i can
and

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
to not go down the line of possibly
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
speaking of anything i i will just say
 
02:11:14.229 --> 02:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
that i certainly have never spoken to
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
the governor or anybody in the
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
governor's office on this this is a
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body and i can tell you i
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
spend much time admonishing my
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues in regards to
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
continuing to recognize the separation
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that the constitution has provided us
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i think both member all members of
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
each party around this table regardless
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
of who is sitting in the corner office
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
across the street is always aware of the
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
road ahead
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
and what bumps twists and turns may be
 
02:11:42.719 --> 02:11:45.830 align:start position:0%
and what bumps twists and turns may be
coming

02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
further question
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
further question follow-up so are you
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
saying that i know you said you haven't
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
but no one i'm not i'm going to rule
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
that question out of order that is as to
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
a different branch i
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
just as i would rule out of order a
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not the chair
 
02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:03.189 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not the chair
of

02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:12:03.199 --> 02:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
of
um

02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not even going to go there okay
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%

02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
that should be in the calendar today
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
which same calendar just reminded me i
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
have something i have to get done by the
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
cutoff representative turcotte briefly
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just want to
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
make a quick comment about the county
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
my personality is to be as judicious
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
with our time as possible i chose not to
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
read in all the districts on those maps
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
i have no problem reading those into the
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
record my assumption was those maps
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
would be posted online
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
we would
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
receive public input on them next week
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
at our public input sessions
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
and the following week we would be
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
having a robust discussion about
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
the differences in the maps presented so
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to reading them in if
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
you'd like to no we're not going to do
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
that now representative turcotte we have
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
moved on representative weber
 
02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
um i think that was a hint given given
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
your ruling um i i don't need to comment
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
further on it
 
02:13:40.229 --> 02:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
