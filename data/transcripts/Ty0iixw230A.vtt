e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
put my microphone on just so everybody
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
can hear
 
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
everything and as I understand this
 
00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
session will be uh
 
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
recorded so the reason why I asked you
 
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
all here this
 
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
morning is we have before us um the the
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
Bill uh 1685 which is uh a bill that had
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
some uh redefining Homestead Foods as
 
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
Artisan foods and whole bunch of other
 
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
legislation behind that and this bill
 
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
was um voted interim study by the house
 
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
and by our committee because we felt
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
that um the legislation that was
 
00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
was first of all very complicated
 
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
and uh really needed to be looked at and
 
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
compared to uh current law please take a
 
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
seat along the table here because I'd
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
informal what we have before us is for
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee to to um discuss this
 
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and some of the what we have
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
get an understanding of what our
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
licensing looks like like now and what
 
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and people who are doing
 
00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 align:start position:0%
food production locally would what kinds
 
00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
of changes they would like to see to
 
00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.429 align:start position:0%
of changes they would like to see to
this

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
um the committee as a whole environment
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
and agriculture will be T we have three
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
interim study bills before us this is
 
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
one of them and we will then have to
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
make the recommendation as to whether or
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
not the legislation being considered
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
should be recommended for future
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended for
 
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.750 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommended for
future

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
legislation it's my belief
 
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
that we probably in our discussions of
 
00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
this bill and I've heard so many people
 
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
interested in doing
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
something uh to expand our um local food
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
production abilities for our farmers and
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
other local food producers it's like
 
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
likely that I would imagine our
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee would recommend this for
 
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.870 align:start position:0%
committee would recommend this for
future

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 align:start position:0%
legislation but I'm not going to make
 
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
that determination on my own nor um um I
 
00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
don't know that the four of us will make
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
that decision today either um so I just
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
want to open up the discussion about
 
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
this bill the concept of this bill why
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
why was this bill brought forward what
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
kind of um problem does this kind of
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislation seek to
 
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
solve and temper that with um what kinds
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
of laws we already have in statute
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
regarding licensing regarding food
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
production and managing the risk of
 
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.230 align:start position:0%
production and managing the risk of
foodborn

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
foodborn
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
illness um so I'm gonna I'm going to
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
start this off with um the folks from uh
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
to describe to us what the homestead
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
food operation
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
licensing uh landscape looks like what
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
why we do what we do and uh I'll have it
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
from there and I guess uh we have
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith from Department of Health
 
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 align:start position:0%

problems that you seek to
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
solve with the legislation that you
 
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.110 align:start position:0%

licensing and I also have Erica Davis

representative Aaron said that this is
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
very informal um I'm going to my attempt
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
is to give an overview of our current
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
laws on Homestead food operations but
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to pause and answer
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
any questions that come up as as we go
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
through this okay thank you um ma'am
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
we'd like you to join us up here yeah
 
00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:05.469 align:start position:0%
we'd like you to join us up here yeah
sure

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
today

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
proceed so we'll start with the
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
homestead food operation definition so
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
by Statute in RSA 143a colon 12 a
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
homestead food operation is a person who
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
produces Homestead food products
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
excluding potentially hazardous food so
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
these are foods that require temperature
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
control for safety and it's only in that
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
person's home kitchen of their primary
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
residence in New Hampshire so we have
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
home kitchen means their home kitchen it
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean a garage it doesn't mean a
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
basement it's it's we it's limited to
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
your home kitchen is that excuse me um
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
when you say that's limited to the home
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
kitchen is that actually specified in
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
statute or is that in a rule so this
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
this is the definition from the statute
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
home K it says home kitchen and so
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
that's what we have always um put the
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
guard rails around a home kitchen a home
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
kitchen doesn't mean other areas of of a
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
person's residence it's it's the home
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
kitchen and I believe this was founded
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
in that it was it was meant to give
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
people an opportunity to start small in
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
their home kitchen but the expectation
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
is you're using residential equipment
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
you're using a residential refer Ator a
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
stove it wasn't meant to I'm going to
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
expand and put in commercial um ovens
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
and things like that in my basement or
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
out building or so forth and we do have
 
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
people that do that but they're licensed
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
as a commercial kitchen in that instance
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
it's not a home it's not a homestead
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
food operation yeah representative
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
question if I heard you correctly you
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
said potentially hazardous food mean
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
means food that needs to be controlled
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
by temperature
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
correct and that's it or and it also
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
includes low low acid foods okay thank
 
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
includes low low acid foods okay thank
you

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
sure go
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
ahead so in New Hampshire we have two
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
types of Homestead operations those that
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
are exempt from food lure and those that
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
license so those that are exempt it's
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
purely B based on where they're offering
 
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
the product it's not we don't have any
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
income limitations at one point in time
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
there was a an income limitation that
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
required you to be licensed or not
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
licensed it there was also um it it it's
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
Pur it's it doesn't they can only make
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
the same types of products those that
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't require temperature control for
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
safety the non potentially hazardous
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
foods but depending on where you're
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
selling it that's what determines
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
whether or not you need the license so
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
those that are exempt from a homestead
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
license are those that are selling it
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
from their own residents their own Farm
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
Stand or from a farmers's market or
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
actually and I'm sorry and I this is
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
there's an error in here and or retail
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
food stores that was something that
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
changed um in the last few years that
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
they can also sell at retail
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
stores um if you want to sell to
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
restaurants over the Internet or to
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
wholesalers Brokers or other food
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
Distributors that's when you have to um
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
apply for a license and currently we
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
have 149 lenses it's a it's a $150
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
annual Food Service license and again um
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
we we just as we do um inspections for
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
any other license facilities there is a
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
a inspection that's part of that um
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
these are scheduled inspections because
 
00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
it's person's home we can't we can't
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
just show up randomly at a person's home
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
and not knowing if they're going to be
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
producing food so any Homestead food
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
inspections are they are scheduled and
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
and actually it's um we we welcome this
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity because it's a time for us
 
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
to have a one-on-one with the producer
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
to get any questions answered that they
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
might have whether it's about labeling
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's about um their food storage
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very it um it's it's a
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
very I think educational inspection it's
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
not uh we're trying to help those folks
 
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
make the food in a safe way
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative kto has a
 
00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:34.839 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you madam chair uh
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
again thank you I just want to go back
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
to retail food establishments did you
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
say that they can you can now sell with
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
just the homestead food or do you have
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
to be licensed so if they want to sell
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
to a retail food store that is allowable
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
under an exempt food food license okay
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
so looking at your slide yeah sorry um
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
we could cross off other retail food
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
establishments and move that up to the
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
you yeah um you have a question ma'am
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
can you please uh say your name and
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
where you're
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
from zos and I'm from Dunbarton um and I
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
had a question about something you
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the beginning um when you
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
said that kitchen the kitchen being in
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
the kitchen is by Statute and I was
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could clarify if that's
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
the revised statutes or if that's the
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
administrative code
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
so that's an the actual RSA 143 d a
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
colon 12 okay
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
you so the foods that are allowed to be
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
made in a home food operation Homestead
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
food operation and again these are it's
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
it's all the same types of products
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
whether you require a license or you
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
don't require license so these include
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
bake items such as breads rolls cookies
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
muffins brownies cakes double crusted
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
fruit pies candies fudge um baked dry
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
products herbs spices Etc um acid foods
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
including vinegars
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
and uh mustards and then we recently
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
added processed acidified foods in the
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
last legislative session including
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
pickles and Salsas and of course jams
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
and jellies those have always been
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to be made um the because of the
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
the high sugar content in and the the
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
low PH make them a safer product to be
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
made in a home
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
kitchen the types of prodcts that are
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
not allowed um so the the term
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous that's it's that's
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
that term is is a it's a pretty um it's
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
an older term um the the more modern
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
turn term is called TCS food or it's
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
Foods requiring temperature control for
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
safety so and also low acid foods are
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
not allowed to be made in a homestead
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
food operation so examples of the foods
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
that are not allowed currently are fresh
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
or frozen soups cheesecakes hummus and
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
other dips salads sandwiches and canned
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
green beans would be an example of a low
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
acid food and that is certainly because
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
of because um an item like a green bean
 
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's um acidity can lend to if not
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
processed correctly could lend to the
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
risk of claustrum botulinum if there if
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
it was processed incorrectly and so that
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
because of there's a high risk with
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
processing low acid foods could be
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
things like pumpkin butter um the things
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
that are generally um not high in acid
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
so not like your fruits um that are in
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
jams and jellies these are currently not
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to be made in a homestead food
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
operation in order to make these types
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
of products you would need to have a
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen to do this and we've
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
offered that there are there are certain
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
um facilities in New Hampshire that rent
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
space for for small food producers there
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
our businesses that their sole business
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
is to do this activity or also we've
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
also had instances where someone might
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with um like a local
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
pizza shop that opens at in the
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon they can come in in the
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
morning and use their commercial
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
facility their their sinks their
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration Etc to do their their food
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
production whether they're a caterer
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's making
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
um sandwiches and salads Etc or doing
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
processing so as I mentioned before um
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
the a homestead food operation is
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
restricted to doing food preparation in
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
their home kitchen we don't require the
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
the same standards for physical
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that are other licensed
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
establishments like restaurants grocery
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
stores are held to where by commercial
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
kitchen is not required there's no
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
requirement for a three compartment sink
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to use their a two Bas
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
sink or one Bay sink and a dishwasher
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
for their wear washing um we don't have
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
the the same Plumbing requirements for
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
an indirect waistline for sinks pets are
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to be in the homestead they just
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
have to be excluded from the kitchen
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
production and the products are required
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
to be labeled that they're made in a
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
residential kitchen either um they're
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
exempt from a license or they're
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
licensed as as applicable to the
 
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.669 align:start position:0%
licensed as as applicable to the
particular

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
instance

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah a question from representative
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
com thank you sorry about this um it
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
says there's no requirement for a three
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
compartment sink is a single sink
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable or do they need a double sink
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
so we have allowed them to use a single
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
sink and a dishwasher or a two or 2bay
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
sure so I know there have been some
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's been some confusion about other
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
types of exemptions so I'm just going to
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
um take a a quite a little quick
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
deviation to the other types of
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
establishments that are exempt from a
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
license uh these are occasional Food
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
Service establishment occasional Food
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
Service events and temporary food
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
establishments so these are exempt by
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
Statute from a food service license so
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
the occasional Food Service
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
establishment is any food establishment
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
where food served or provided for the
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
public on premises of the establishment
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a charge no more
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
than 40 days in a 30-day period And so
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
um an example of this would be um a a a
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
vendor at a farmer's market who might be
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
preparing on site sandwiches or sausages
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
or or other prepared foods they can they
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
could go to One farmers's Market a week
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
prepare food on site and not be required
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
to have a license based on this
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
statute so is this actually in statute
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
or is this a rule this is in statute
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay so occasional food service is
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
defined in statute and ex exempt from a
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
statute so we also have what's called
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service events and these
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
are events that are not regularly
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
scheduled this could be something like a
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
homecoming barbecue a a fireman's um
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
chicken dinner these are things that are
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
not regularly scheduled they happen um
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
irregularly and they are not required to
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
well question from representative comto
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
and then thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
you again are there any foods that are
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
exempt from these uh from being
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
um used from these occasional Food
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
Service establishments or sold or given
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
out so it these are these can be a
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
challenge because we don't have any
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
there's no regul they're not required to
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
be licensed or inspected so there's no
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight over these types of
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
venues so we we have recommendations on
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
our website that are posted for
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Services or those that
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
are exempt from a license but but we
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any enforcement over these
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
these items thank you okay and you have
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
representative hward I'm sorry thank you
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair um Miss Smith so under an
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service event that would
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
include Church bake sales yes um
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
Community dinners old home Day events
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
um farmers markets that are sponsored by
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities private
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprises for example well I think I
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
think that's um my the farmers's market
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
depending on if that gets into that Reg
 
00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
again these are not regularly scheduled
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
events so if you have a farmers market
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's every T every Tuesday um from 2:
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
to 4: that's a regularly scheduled event
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fall under that occasional
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
um Food Service
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
event okay thank you representative ktoa
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to follow
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
up on something um where with representa
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
Elward um so what your saying is an
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service event so like a
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
farmers market that's scheduled every
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
Saturday would not be occasional what if
 
00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
there was a breakfast scheduled every
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
month just at a certain on at a certain
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
venue is would that be considered an
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
occasional or would they then need a
 
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen so likely you also so
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
and this is where I I perfectly um agree
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
that there's confusion over this because
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
you also have your occasional Food
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
Service establishment so so those could
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
be considered a a church a church
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
breakfast that happens every Sunday four
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
days in a month we I know some Sundays
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
some some mons have five Sundays we we
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the purposes of this we we're not
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
going to require a license in that
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
instance so and I think to be I don't
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
these these um exemptions have been in
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
place for many many years prior to I've
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
been with the department since 2008
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
they've been there since then I I think
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
they probably were founded in having
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
this abil AB ility not to definitely
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
also being cognizant of the Department's
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
resources that um there there's many
 
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
many many of these happening every every
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
weekend every day across New Hampshire
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
so um looking at not necessarily that
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
the admitting that there's not high-risk
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
foods but because of the frequency that
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
there that they have been allowed to
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
offer that's one of the reasons why I
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
think I I I would say is probably
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's no licensing requirements
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
so my question then is why wouldn't a
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
farmer's market be included in
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
occasional Food
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
Service I mean they they don't don't
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
meet all year round normally it's just
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
the summer months once a
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
week so so I think it's it's a matter of
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the farmers market itself
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't serving food you have
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
individual operators within the farmers
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
market that are providing food that are
 
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
market that are providing food that are
providing

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
providing
 
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
providing
food

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative Elward and and
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%

illnesses I I I I do remember the
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
request but I I guess I would have to be
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me it was a few
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
months ago to know exactly what the of
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
the request was and um in it it
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
says of all the
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
complaints um your department handled
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
confirm that's your understanding of
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
complaints regarding food board and
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
Service establishment um so you that
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
people at farmers markets can serve food
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's time temperature controlled for
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
safety my understanding of that statute
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
was that it was only applicable to um
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
people who are serving food from the
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
premises where it was prepared and I was
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could explain kind of
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
how that fits into the idea of a church
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
breakfast or a farmer market where
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
you're not doing the preparation on
 
00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:21.549 align:start position:0%
you're not doing the preparation on
site

00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
so the definition of an occasional Food
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
Service establishment is again provided
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
for the public on the premise Prem so
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
that the expectation is that you're
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
making that food on the pre on the
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
premises right so how would that fit
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
into the farmers market where you're
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
bringing a bunch of prepared things that
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're then assembling on site so that
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
that again you wouldn't be allowed to do
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
that You' be you're limited to on-site
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
preparation you're not supposed to so
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
you're like are you baking the bread
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
there how does that work so a bread
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be something if it's baked bread
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
it would be something you'd be allowed
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
to do in a home food operation and then
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
you could bring it to the Farmers Market
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay and then about the statute in terms
 
00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:02.909 align:start position:0%
okay and then about the statute in terms
of

00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
occasional is there somewhere in the
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
statute where it says it can't be a
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
regularly scheduled event because the
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
way that I read the statute is that it's
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
4 days in a 30-day period regardless of
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
not so it's four days and a i four days
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
and a 30-day period I'm not quite I'm
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
not quite sure there again there's a
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
separate definition for occasional food
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
service event so for establishment so it
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
can be regular if it's an EST occasional
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
Food Service establishment it just has
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
to not go above the threshold of four
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
days in a 30day period exactly
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you for those
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
explanations and
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
continue and then finally we have what's
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
called a temporary Food Service
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
establishment so this is any food
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
service establishment which operates at
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
a fixed location for a period of time
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
not to exceed two weeks in conjunction
 
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
with a Fair carnival circus public
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
exhibition or simil similar transitory
 
00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
Gathering and so this would be certainly
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
um probably something that's freshed in
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
our minds would be hopkington fair like
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
th those all those Food Service vendors
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
at the hopkington fair have no oversight
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
no licensing requirements from from our
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
um from our section Deerfield fair is
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
another example um it doesn't mean if
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
you which I'll get to in the next slide
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
is there are self- inspecting cities and
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
towns and so some of them do license
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
temporary events so Manchester for
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
example conquered those are there are 15
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
self- inspecting cities and towns which
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
are on this map that may have different
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
regulations so in Manchester I know they
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
do license even like church dinners or
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
church breakfast they have what it's a
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
reduced license but they do have a
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
licensing process for that so um that's
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
what I just want to M make that that can
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
U make that point that it also can
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
create confusion because there are
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
differences and regulations depending on
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction and who has the
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight when it comes to
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
food do you know what statute gives them
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
the authority to be a self-inspect city
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
or town so in it's in RSA
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
47 and I can get you the exact uh
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
um the EXA the exact location within
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
represent thank you madam chairman Miss
 
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.950 align:start position:0%
represent thank you madam chairman Miss
Smith

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
um what were we talking about about the
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
self- inspecting T yes so if this
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
legislation was to move forward in
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
whatever form it takes um it would be
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable to uh accept the 15
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
self-regulating cities which would
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
answer the concerns like of the
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh Health Department for
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
example so I I do know that I I do know
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
that the cities and towns feel very
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
strongly about being able to make their
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
own they you know certainly collect um
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
revenues from licensing those events
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
they um feel very strongly some of them
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
have zoning requirements that don't
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
allow home food production so they feel
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
very strongly about keeping those um
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
those their status for being able to
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
permit the events that they do
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
intact follow up M Madam chair yeah go
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
ahead follow yes um and I will admit
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
that that didn't come to mind when I was
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
doing the self- inspecting cities didn't
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
come to mind so it was my
 
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.110 align:start position:0%
come to mind so it was my
mistake

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions so far no go
 
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.350 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions so far no go
ahead

00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
so and I just these are our contact
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
information so if you have any follow-up
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions after uh after today's meeting
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to take them um and and
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
we're here to provide information on the
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
current regulation we would definitely
 
00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:18.039 align:start position:0%
we understand that there's a lot of
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
confusion this these weren't these
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
weren't um regulations that we Creed in
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
of our own we have to interpret them and
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
try to do our best with what we know is
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
was the intent at the time um we feel
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
very strongly that uh supporting local
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
food an opportunity but we also have to
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
be cognizant of food safety risk and we
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
know that home kitchens while people may
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
be well-intentioned is that they're not
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
always designed to do um Mass amounts of
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
food production they don't have the they
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
don't have facilities that were designed
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
to cool foods for instance um in in a
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
quick man so if you're making large
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
amounts of of chili or soup um that's
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
certainly a consideration we also want
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
to point out is is that we have
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions for licensing which do make
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
does make it very very difficult to
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
enforce and we do get complaints uh we
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
get complaints about homesteads people
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
not doing what they're what they're
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to do making things like
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
cheesecakes or or other foods that
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
require refrigeration our respons is is
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
that we try to reach out with bya letter
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
to those folks um first and explain to
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
them that this is the regulation you're
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
not allowed to do these Foods in your
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
home you can do these Foods or you can
 
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
pursue Licensing in a commercial kitchen
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
but I I do want to say that it can be
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult for us to enforce this we
 
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
don't regularly enforce farmers markets
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
where a lot of Home H produced foods are
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
being offered um we did actually have a
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
summer intern who worked with us and did
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
some surveying at Farmers Market Market
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and did some assessments and we'd be
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
happy to share her findings um you know
 
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
she found labeling was probably the
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
biggest thing that she found out of
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
compliance at when she did that survey
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
at the farmers markets so we do know as
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
best as we can to try to inform people
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
of what the regulations are is that
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
there are things that are are happening
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that that we that we might not know
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
about or um have a very difficult time
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing okay I I have a question and
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
so as far as um Foods allowed to be made
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
in Homestead food operations you had a
 
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.710 align:start position:0%
in Homestead food operations you had a
whole

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
list excuse me um where does dried foods
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
and freezed dried foods fall in that
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
list so if it's an air dried food like
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
air like a dried herb or spice we have
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
we've allowed that in a homestead when
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to freeze drying that that's
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
considered a process and we know there
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
could be food safety risks with not
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
getting that U the correct water
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
activity in a freeze dried in a freeze
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
dried situation so that's not a product
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we've allowed in a homestead
 
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.549 align:start position:0%
that we've allowed in a homestead
operation

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm sorry okay hold on one
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
second I'm sorry yeah put you uh
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative costable could you yes
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sure sure thank you for
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you said you sent
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
out you send letters out as your first
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
Contact for some somebody that is not
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
following the rules or statutes can you
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
give us um the number of letters that
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
you've sent out either yearly or over a
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
period of time sure I I can go I would
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
have to go back and get that exact
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
number I'd say it's probably on the
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
order of 20 maybe a
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
year okay representative um go on it's
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
been a long thank you mad summer for
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
getting everybody that's okay um thank
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
you for putting together the
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
presentation I like the information um
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you DHHS if you guys
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
have thought a little bit more if you
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
have any more opinions about labeling
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
requirements because uh this these types
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
of uh legislation you know the 14 other
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
states or whoever many now have had
 
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
success with having having uniform
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements and so we are kind
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
of seeing here that we have a problem
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
with uh duplicity or
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
duplicative things because New Hampshire
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
is uh you know well known for being a
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
local control you know state so we do
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
have these kind of confusing guidelines
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh coming from the state level and then
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
we can you know a locality can just say
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want any of this so you know
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
have you guys thought a little bit about
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
maybe just having uniform labeling
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
requirements and would that help because
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that could help you
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
know with farmers markets and uh like a
 
00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:15.589 align:start position:0%
know with farmers markets and uh like a
community

00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
event so so just so I I can understand
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
so are you talking
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
about like like ingredient labeling are
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
you talking about the the exempt from
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so one idea that been kicked around
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit is to have
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS in charge of enforcing labeling so
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
you like the state could even design a
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
label and the state could just have a
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
label that would have you know the the
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
person could customize it and basically
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
everyone would be required to use this
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
label for these types of
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
products so so we do have have a sample
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
label on our website that lists the the
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
minimum information that has to be on
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
that label I think some of the problems
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
with standardizing the the label is is
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
the you know the size of the them
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
because certainly you might have a candy
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that is very different than
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
someone making jams and jellies and and
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
can do different things with their label
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
so we definitely do have um standardized
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
information that's required to be on
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
that label but as far as any kind of
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
format that that's not something that
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're prescriptive on on the layout of
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
that information is that something um
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
the apartment is receptive toward I
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
think it would probably be more um we
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
would definitely want to take Industries
 
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
impact into that because they you know
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
certainly they're bearing the burden of
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
of having that information on their
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
product we definitely just want to make
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
sure the content and information is is
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
there in a format that's readable and
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
understandable to to a
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
consumer okay and then um Miss leader
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
zos right yeah go ahead Addie I wanted
 
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
to say that I think that the
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
Department's labeling requirements are
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
very clear you just Google like
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
Homestead Foods New Hampshire and
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
there's a thing that tells you yeah it
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
has to be in 10-point font and it has to
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
have these elements and there's a sample
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
label um the idea of having a template
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
for the label I think would be very
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
harmful to producers like us um we spend
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of time making sure that our
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
labels match our aesthetic that they are
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
clear to Consumers that they're
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
appealing that they highlight the
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
information that we want to highlight
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
like you know special ingredients that
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
might be in there what's from our farm
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
what's made in New Hampshire and
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
requiring us to match the design of
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
everybody else's labels is such a huge
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
kick in the teeth to your marketability
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
that I think it would be just a terrible
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
idea sorry that's okay I'm glad you
 
00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:55.030 align:start position:0%
idea sorry that's okay I'm glad you
showed

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
up you don't you don't want a whole
 
00:37:58.990 --> 00:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
shelf of JS that all have the exact same
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
label particularly when you have to use
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
the same recipes unless you're willing
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
to pay for a process
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
review um I'm sorry I forgot your name
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Linda Paulson thank you madam
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
chair sure um I am in agreeance that I
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
believe a standardized label is going to
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
be very difficult to enforce for the
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
simple fact that different products
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
carry different ingredient lists and yes
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
a candy maker May potentially have many
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
more ingredients than someone simply
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
producing a chocolate chip cookie uh in
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
labeling a thought uh if DHHS were to
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
offer an online class that offered a
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
certificate at the end of one hour or
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
whatever time frame were required to
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
teach these are the elements that that
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
we have on our website and then you have
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
oversight of who is knowledgeable of
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
that proper labeling might that be a
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
solution that could satisfy that
 
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.309 align:start position:0%
solution that could satisfy that
standardized

00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
standardized
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
requirement and the freedom
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
to allow your product to stand out with
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's your farm product or your
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
specialized ingredient
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'm interested to know know um
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are of providing some
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
sort of online course or doing some kind
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
of course through UNH
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
extension uh to provide some of our
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
producers with more information so that
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's not you know somebody produces
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
something and say oh my God how do I
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
sell this and rather than them going out
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
and just doing
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
whatever um you know this would I think
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
go a long way to helping people
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
understand what they need to do and how
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
they need to do it you know we you know
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
always are in support of of educational
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities and and food safety
 
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
increasing food in safety for our
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
producers and being able to have those
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
forms to answer questions because we we
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
certain we know that it can be confusing
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
we we spend a lot of hours on the phone
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
each and every day trying to answer
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
questions of what folks can and cannot
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
do and and how to do things properly or
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
guide iding them to um whether it's uh
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
extension resources from New Hampshire
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
or eain to to get further food safety
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
information so we definitely would be in
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
support of that um the way I just want
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
to also just emphasize is that the way
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
way our current structure is with having
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
that exempt group of exempt group from
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
licensing we could make it a a a
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
suggested or voluntary program but
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
without having there's no registration
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
or no process for us to document that
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
any that someone has taken that class if
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
they're an exempt home well that's what
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
I would think is that if they were going
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
to take this online course that that
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
would somehow register them with your
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
department and that at the completion of
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
that course they can receive some sort
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
of certification to show that they've
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
been through that
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
training and and been through it
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
successfully maybe they have to have you
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
know pass some sort of test or something
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
at the end um uh you know then perhaps
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that would allow them
 
00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
um to produce foods that are not made in
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
Homestead food operations if they had
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
training um in in how to produce fresher
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
frozen soups or cheesecakes or whatever
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner so I don't know what
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
your thought is on that I'd like to know
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
so so certainly I I think training is a
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction I do just
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
want to Circle back to we have there's
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
the concern is also the equipment
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
limitations in a home home kitchen
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
setting is that you have you might have
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
a you have your household food that you
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
have stored in your refrigerator but now
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
if you're you are have this growing
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
business that you also now have to
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
figure out how am I going to put this
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
kettle of soup in or a she pan of soup
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
in to make sure it cools Pro properly is
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
that is that we we also want to be
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the limitations that there
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
can be in a home environment for being
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
able to to do the other parts of this
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
not only not only labeling but um but
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
keeping food at the required
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
temperatures so is a
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
concern the amount of food that a person
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
is producing on some scheduled amount
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know weekly or daily or whatever um
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
in so far as what they'd be able to sell
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
so it would be the amount and and again
 
00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:02.559 align:start position:0%
um the the type of food is that that the
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
way the homestead food operation now it
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's very it's limited to things that
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
have controls when you have a Bak good a
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
cookie is you're cooking you're baking
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you're cooking it it's shelf stable
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
when you have something like a
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
cheesecake you're also baking it but now
 
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
you have to store it at in a
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
refrigerator if you have 20 cheesecakes
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
if you have two cheesecakes maybe there
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a difference in how you
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
can do that safely but how how do we
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
make a regulation that says you can only
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
make two cheesecakes you can't make 20
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
because we don't trust your home
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that that's where you know
 
00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
it becomes very very difficult to parse
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
when you have when you make that
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
allowance for um things that require
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
temperature control to to um to figure a
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh the best pathway forward when when
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately you have to consider we're
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're allowing this in a in a home
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
kitchen okay representative K you had a
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
question I did I just wanted to go back
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
to the labeling thing and I think that
 
00:44:02.549 --> 00:44:02.559 align:start position:0%
um instead of the department taking it
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
on um to work in conjunction with the
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
UNH extension uh Cooperative because
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
they offer a lot of classes and they do
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
a lot uh in conjunction with dhh they've
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
had a very successful rabbit and poultry
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
course um that has been rolled out and
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
has been offered for years now um and
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
people have come to know and if through
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
the Farm Bureau and advertising with DH
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
HS if UNH periodically would offer that
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
extension would offer that course
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
online um you know and then people could
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
print out a certificate once they
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
completed it I think that would be a
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
plus um you know if we wanted to have
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of training I mean obviously
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't need to be required um
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
because it's not required now and I'm
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
looking at they they do have a sample of
 
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
what a label looks like right on uh the
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
homestead uh page uh for chocolate chip
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
cookies if anyone wants to uh know
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
what's in chocolate chip cookies um but
 
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion is to be
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
working with UNH extension Cooperative
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
because uh they really do specialize in
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
educational uh programs representative
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
kraton had a question I'll go
 
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
around yes ma'am um thank you again for
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
your your testimony it's as always your
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
spot on um
 
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at I'm looking at the at the
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh at the bill and and the way I read
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is that you want the the
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to create Artisan
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
foods that allow the sale of those
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
things that are now restricted to
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
sell is that so that would be my
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill and and I I
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
would also defer to representative alaer
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
as I know she
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
she she had put it forward so she might
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
have more insight into um into the uh
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
the the completeness of what you were
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
looking to do okay for a followup a
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
followup yeah okay and I'll I'll wait
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
for the for that but but as you read
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
this though and and you've brought up
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
specifically the
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
refrigeration issue um this from a DHHS
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
perspective opens the the gate a little
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
bit too far in terms of what can
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
reasonably healthily be sold safely be
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
sold we definitely have concerns about
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
opening opening up the the window for um
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
expansion of things that require
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
refrigeration for safety and also we
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
also want to think about the ven as as I
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
recall in the in the in the bill as
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
proposed is that it it allowed these to
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
be offered at many many locations it
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't just um you know n I'm coming to
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
your house or your Farmstand and I want
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
to buy this product it that they could
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
be sold in in stores they could be sold
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
at restaurants is that we definitely
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
have a concern if is making sure people
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
are aware that these are made in a home
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
food operation um and
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
that the the also the locations that
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're made um certainly we we wouldn't
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
want somebody um who has a restaurant to
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
go be making all their prepping at home
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
and then bringing this to the restaurant
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
the customer has thinks they're
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
purchasing food that was made at the
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant and it was actually made you
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
know in in somebody's home kitchen is is
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
also full disclosure to the consumer to
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
make those choices as well okay great
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um Miss leader
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
elos labeling um I think a lot of you
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
are talking in generalities oh there's
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
problems with labels people don't know
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
how to do them it might be helpful to
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
dial in a little bit more on what
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
aspects of the labels people AR missing
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
and I will say that from having
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
participated in tons of online baking
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
forums for people who bake at home
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
there's really three issues with the
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
labeling one is that um people don't
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
understand how
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
to write out the sub ingredients of
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
things like baking powder or a
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
commercial item like a Oreo that they're
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
putting into their homebaked thing two
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of Home Bakers don't know
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
how to convert from a volume measurement
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
to a weight measurement so they have a
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
hard time putting those items in order
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
and they might not do it correctly and
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
then their label is wrong and three is
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
the requirement to have your address
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
your home address on a product that
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
you're selling at the farmers market I
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of concerns um
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
particularly among the demographic that
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
most commonly is doing home baking which
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
is women about personal safety you hear
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
this question all the time how how
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
should I sell my stuff at the farmers
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
market so that people don't know exactly
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
where me and my kids live I'm a single
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
mom whatever there was a very very
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
widely publicized um home invasion and
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
rape of a home Baker in Iowa where
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
someone came to her home pretending to
 
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
be a customer only knew about it from
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
the label on her product um and then
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
obviously had this horrible violent
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
event happen to her and so I wonder
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
Colleen if you're seeing these three
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
problems addresses weights and ordering
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
things um and some ingredients if those
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
are some of the most common problems or
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
if there are other problems that you're
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
seeing with the labels so I I think that
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
I think you did hit those spot on is
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
that th those are problems we have we
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
have allowed people to put a an email
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
address in L of a physical address if
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
they if as we just want to have be able
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
to let the consumer have a way to
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
contact that person if they have any
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns about the product
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
you consider something like a producer
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
number which is what like Maryland
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
Arkansas Minnesota they offer the option
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
of either having your home address or a
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
health department assigned producer
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
number so that your address is blocked
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
from sort of public
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge I think it as long as there
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
was an established means of of some way
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
that that consumer would be able to be
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
able to get more information about the
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
product or if you know they they
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
experienced an adverse event you know
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
chipped a tooth or or they might just
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to order more or more order more
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
hey you
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
know uh representative award
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
chairman Miss Smith um back to
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
labeling the Crux of my bill was to open
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
up the industry the homemade food
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
industry to include potentially
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
or TS TCS
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
Foods um and in that was the very most
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
important labeling requirement of the
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
statement refrigerat right after
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
purchase not after opening but after
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
purchase which designates it as a you
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
know it could even say
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
perishable refrigerate after purchase so
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
the onus is on the consumer if buying uh
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
fresh salsa that's vended out of a
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
cooler filled with ice for
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
example um have you thought about that
 
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.430 align:start position:0%
example um have you thought about that
particular

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
statement in relation to whether or not
 
00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
this bill moves forward to allow TCS
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
Foods so so I think having a clear con
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
having clear instructions for the
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
consumer about how the food should be
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
stored that that that should be that
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
that would be an important an important
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
um aspect of this however I think it's
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's more the downstream is where is
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
where we are have our concerns about how
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
is it is it held under proper
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
temperature at production through
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
distribution um to that consumer right
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
followup Madam chair yeah follow up um
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
yes that would be included in what I'm
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
proposing as a type of food safety
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
course that would be a requirement it
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be in the law and administrative
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
rules um
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
so given the fact that we don't have
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
that many complaints and that this has
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
been rampant non-compliance for decades
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
plus Community dinners that are serving
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
thousands of people across the state uh
 
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
with foods that are advertised as you
 
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
with foods that are advertised as you
know

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
homemade um this is where I'm trying to
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
get to with DHHS And in regards to the
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
statement that you sent me by email that
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
domestic Refrigeration was not adequate
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
for food production
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's what you wrote um if you have a
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
domestic refrigerator that holds at 41
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
degrees or less and you have a
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
commercial unit that holds it 41 degrees
 
00:53:06.599 --> 00:53:08.470 align:start position:0%
commercial unit that holds it 41 degrees
or

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
less and if you
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
have uh homemade food producers making
 
00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.390 align:start position:0%
have uh homemade food producers making
small

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
batches typically they are small batches
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
of whatever they make because they're
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
take 75 bottles of salsa to a farmer
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
Market if they can only s sell
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
10 so it seems to me that DHHS is
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
imposing this kind of dire um extreme on
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
the homemade food producers who have no
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
intention of exceeding their
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration capacity you know they
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
could bring in coolers for that matter
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
overnight and then go vend the next day
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
for example so so I I just wanted to
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
make that comment thank you okay I'm
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
going to go to representative costable
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
and then over this side again go ahead
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and just to
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
bounce off of of that uh we do me me and
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
my wife do sell at farmers markets and
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
we sell uh fruit pies and one of the
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
things we would love to be able to do is
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
um um sell periodically we have uh
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving coming up we would like to
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
be able to sell
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh pumpkin pie right and it it seems
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
like that um it just is honorous I we've
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
we've done I've I've asked everybody it
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
is universal when we say people ask us
 
00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:40.599 align:start position:0%
can you do it nope sorry we can't do it
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
why not so um the the limitation on the
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
food is pretty much to what our extra we
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
have an extra refrigerator what can we
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
fit in there it would be probably eight
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
pies if we and we would pre-order order
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
them so people would know they're coming
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
specifically for those pie and that's
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the extent we're just
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
trying to get a little bit more I'm
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're not we're never going to be a
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen we're never going to
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
we're never going to sell 50 potentially
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods in a day it's very
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
limited to what we can do which is small
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
batches really small batches and they're
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
from people that we know we know these
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
people so one of the ideas that we were
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
tossing around on the labeling side was
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
so we have fruit pies and that has the
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
exempt from um that has the exemption
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
label on it along with all the other
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
stuff we had talked about um I would I
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
would say I'm not opposed to a warning
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
label on TCS food so next to your fruit
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
pies that has the exemption that were
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
were exempt from inspection would be if
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
we're selling anything that has
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
temperature control would be a warning
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
label to Consumers that way they they
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
fully understand that this product for
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
one it's a it's a conversation starter
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
because the law would be changing it
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
would be something new that we're there
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
that we're able to sell and so it would
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
be a conversation started for one to
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
educate them that this is different and
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
it needs refrigeration and it's just
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
that that gives the consumer um the
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
information they need that this is um
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be refrigerated and uh it
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
separates it from the the other um
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
exemption label so it could be a
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
different label is what we're saying and
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
and again just just to say it's because
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're not I'm we're not looking for to
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
do this great big amount it's just a
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
little bit here a little bit extra here
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit here and usually
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
seasonality plays into a huge part of
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
that and it's not um you know the to me
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
the potential risk is extremely low when
 
00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
we just participated in in food sales
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
and fundraisers and everything we didn't
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
we don't produce it ourselves but
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
everyone else had potentially hazardous
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
food nobody's gotten sick right it's
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh like like they were saying
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
thousands this this occurs all over the
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
state without a problem it just seems to
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
be a problem when we want to exchange it
 
00:57:16.839 --> 00:57:17.510 align:start position:0%
be a problem when we want to exchange it
for

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
money anyway thank you I I don't know
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
your name yeah no that's okay so yes so
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
I just want to introduce myself I'm
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
Wendy Johnny I'm the food safety State
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
special for un Cooperative Extension
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
nice to meet you and likewise Madam
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
chair and others um so I just in terms
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
of I did wanted to offer myself in terms
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
of uh any sort of uh feedback input um
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
in relation to the sort of food safety
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
piece of things but also wanted to um
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned UNH Cooperative Extension
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
working closely on some of this work and
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
I just want to emphasize that we have
 
00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
and we've enjoyed that week work we
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
thought it has been very important I
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
know for the rabbit and poultry course
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
and then also just in this Homestead
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
food operation space too we have done
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
educational Mater we have education
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
materials and we actually have gone out
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
to different sites and done sometimes in
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration sometimes on our own some
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
work in relation to education around
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
this and we would be welcome to
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
potentially future sort of educational
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
material in this noting that if you are
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
going to bring in UNH extension probably
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
worth discussing terms of just our
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
capacity too I actually wear two hats we
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
have two other team members um
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh but definitely of interest and what
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
so what's your uh feasibility for
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
offering an online course for uh
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
potential food producers yeah so I think
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
it really depends on what the the an
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
online course can take a variety of
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
different it can play out in a variety
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
of different ways I mean we do the
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
rabbit and poultry course which actually
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
is online but moving to in person um so
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
I think if an online C could be
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
something that is just a one andone kind
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
of you actually have a recording with an
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
online course so it could be something
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
of that nature so I think it really
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
depends on what it is we we are I'd say
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
booked Beyond capacity right now I'm not
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to pretend we are not so I do
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
think if it's something that is we
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
should have additional discussions
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
potentially depending on what you're
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
thinking and what that could potentially
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
look like and I know that DHHS also does
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of work in that space as well yeah
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
um representative kto and then I'll come
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
back over here thank you madam chair I
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up on something
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
you said uh we have had um people from
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
UNH extension into our town uh for food
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
safety and uh they do great
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
presentations um so they do come out to
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh if if you request that in your town
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
or maybe a group um they're very
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
receptive okay over here thank you madam
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
chairwoman um my name is Michael
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
Williams I'm Addie's husband and her
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
business partner um and I wanted to just
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
kind of put some things out into the
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
space here uh in terms of this
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
discussion uh based on our experience
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
combined 25 years running um
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
professional food operations and um both
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
have been served safe and food handler
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
certified in states that have way more
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
regulation and education requirements
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire um which is partially
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we live in New
 
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now um but um a couple of
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
things in terms of um your concern about
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
Commercial Refrigeration is absolutely
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
valid um one of the things one of the
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
most important pieces of safety
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
equipment in a kitchen is the
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
refrigeration and there's already a
 
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that was communicated to us
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
through our inspecting agent that any um
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration temperature equipment must
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
be commercial freezers don't necessarily
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
have to be for the farm store and that
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
made perf sense to me and the the thing
 
01:00:59.470 --> 01:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
that she's describing where you have
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
like a huge pot of soup or a big hotel
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
pan a home refrigerator does not have
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
the capacity through the cooling coils
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
to move that heat around fast enough to
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
cool that down at a safe time period or
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
to guarantee that it will it's not just
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
about keeping the temperature low it's
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
about getting the temperature yeah it's
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
about how fast the temperature changes
 
01:01:22.349 --> 01:01:22.359 align:start position:0%
so um you know it seems obvious to me
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we can do if
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
someone does want to make Artisan food
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and use TC and produce and sell TCS
 
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
Foods out of a home kitchen it's not it
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to put in a two-door Tron
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that was used we'd spend
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
$1,500 go pick it up spend about 500
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
bucks to have a technician look at it to
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's working up to spec
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then we've spent $2,000 on a
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that helps us make safe
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
food if we are required to build a
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen in our particular
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
instance we're probably looking at over
 
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 we have to install a new septic
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
system we have to install a new power
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
supply and a new box like there's like
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh the difference between replacing
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment or adding a piece
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
of equipment to a home environment which
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
can run on home power just fine you
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
might have to have an electrician run a
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
220 line or something but uh and and
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
spending uh you know six figures
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
possibly building a commercial kitchen
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
whereas the the thing that makes that
 
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
food safe when it's changing
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
temperatures is not the air gapped
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
Plumbing it's not the handwashing
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
stations it's the refrigerator um the
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
you know also something that we've
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
noticed something that made itself very
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
obvious to us since we opened our farm
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
store last November um there are people
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
who come to our farm store who are
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
looking for whole raw ingredients that
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
are extremely high quality and carefully
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
grown and all this but for the most part
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
people are looking for prepared foods so
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of the economic viability of a
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
small business you have to be able to
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
sell things that people want to buy and
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
there's a limit to how many muffins and
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
how many brownies yeah
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
yeah compared to sayt pot pies if we
 
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
could put pot pies and hummus in our
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
fridge we would have absolutely no
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
Financial concerns you know we know that
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
we would be absolutely mobbed okay so um
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's a serious concern um and in terms
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
of food safety you know both with the
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
labeling and with food safety no one's
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
going to have a higher incentive to make
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure the food they sell is safe than the
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
person selling it their livelihood
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
depends on that and one one bad
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
complaint one association with food born
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
illness from DHHS destroys your business
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
instantaneously it takes a decade to
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
overcome that stuff I've seen it happen
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
even with established restaurants that
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
were doing millions of dollars a year in
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
sales they have become unviable in the
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
space of three months because of things
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
like this um so it's really important to
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
the person who's running the business
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
and whose livelihood depends on it to
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that their food is safe and go
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
going back to the labeling requirements
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
you can set up a class to make sure
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
people uh understand the labeling
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
requirements and all that I think you
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
guys have done a great job of making it
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
clear what's required on the label it's
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
very easy to find it's very easy to
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
understand and um you know I go back to
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
my experience in the military and the
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
three most dreaded letters in the
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
military are CBT computer-based training
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
if you have to go on and sit there and
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
click through a training uh uh
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
slideshow that is something people
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
really genuinely don't want to do and
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
what ends up happening is you click
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
through you barely pass the test at the
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
end and you get your certificate whereas
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
you've got basically two people doing
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
business people who want to scale People
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
Like Us who want to do this full-time
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
and want to make it our entire living
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
who in New Hampshire with given the
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
population and population density it is
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to fly under the radar
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
we are small we don't even having a
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
thousand followers on Facebook yet but
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
we've already been referred to in our
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
town as celebrities Okay so like there
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
is no possibility that a food operation
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
our size or the size we want to be is
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
going to fly under the radar
 
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
here people who want to do it as a side
 
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
business who are not relying on it for
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
their primary
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
income whether you put the training up
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
there or not they are much more likely
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
to try and operate in the gray or stay
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
out of sight and they're not going to
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
care about the laboring requirements
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
either way whether you do an online
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
course or not so um for us we want to
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
make sure the label is on there for us
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
like we were going to label it anyway
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
because there are allergens there are
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
things that people um are are preferring
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
to avoid in their diet that are going to
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
be in our foods that we want to make
 
01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
sure they have the opportunity to see in
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
our Foods um and you know one of the
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
things about the The Artisan food
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that's been proposed is it
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
opens the door in some people's opinions
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
too wide but also it opens the door to
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
the professionalization of local food in
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
this state um the more you allow people
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
to make a living fully on this the more
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
professionals will be drawn to doing it
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
and the more safe the food will become
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
and as you mentioned there's like three
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
complaints you send out 20 letters in a
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
year it sounds like the food's pretty
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
safe based on incentives and if you want
 
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
to have oversight I can understand that
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
but the the more you allow this space to
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
be professionalized the more likely you
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
are to get safe
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
food so I just want to add a couple of
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
things too is
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
that especially
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
postco people are more drawn to uh
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to obtain locally grown food when
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing uh reports all the time of
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know all these recalls from Bor head
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh deli food
 
01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
and uh you know Tyson chicken recalls
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
and all other kind of these Mega big
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
producers having problems because of the
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
amount of food that they're producing
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
and not being able to keep it
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
temperature controlled or germ free or
 
01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:15.870 align:start position:0%
temperature controlled or germ free or
whatever

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
so more is the impetus
 
01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:22.359 align:start position:0%
for people wanting to have something
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
from their local Farm or something a
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
small smaller operation where where
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
things really are um paid attention to
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that's where a lot of this
 
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
feeling is coming from this kind of
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
legislation we saw more than one bill
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
hit my committee this year having to do
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
with expansion of what uh our farmer our
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
farmers and small local producers can
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
offer because people want it and um and
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
and I just think that that this is this
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
is something that we really seriously
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to take a look at to see where in
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
our statutes we can make some uh more
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
accommodation but I also understand the
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
issue of risk management um the more
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
food is being produced the more there is
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
a possibility perhaps of uh foodborn
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
Illness but from what we're seeing in um
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
um where more producers are starting to
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
enter the market um we're not seeing in
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
a huge uptick in in foodborn illness or
 
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
letters being written to DHHS saying
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
somebody was poisoned um so I I think
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
that we really we really have to find a
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
way um to make some of this expansion
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
happen because the consumers want it
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
they want locally grown stuff um and
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
locally produced stuff because they feel
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
that they can trust that more than what
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're starting to see in their own
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
supermarkets um with that I don't know
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions or
 
01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:10.510 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions or
comments

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
for DHHS and their presentation but I'd
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
certainly like to have representative
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
aart talk about her bill a little bit
 
01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.430 align:start position:0%
aart talk about her bill a little bit
more

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
and so if there are any other questions
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
you had
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
question about um the bill in terms of
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused about why we're
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
talking about creating a new um food
 
01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
safety course or program um there's
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
already a lot of there's a national
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
program called Serve Safe that's used
 
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
everywhere and almost everyone who works
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
in a restaurant at some point gets it
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's you know you can take a weekend
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
class you can do it online you can um do
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
it once a week you can there there's all
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
these options it's very well program
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's not that expensive for people to
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
take we had talked about that in our
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh with one of the other bills
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
and what we had discovered was that with
 
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
and what we had discovered was that with
serve

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
serve
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
save it sort of um was a little bit
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what a local producer
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
would need and also had a big component
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
having to do with handling
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
shellfish and and items like that and um
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
it I think you do have different courses
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
is what was your opinion on that so so
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
SP so Sur safe is is designed for
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager so
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
those are it's it's really geared to
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
people that are running a a restaurant
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
or a deli or or a a a reg a grocery I'm
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
sorry a restaurant food service so it it
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
it is more it's not necessarily geared
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
to someone that's preparing jellies and
 
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
jams while there might be some
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
principles that are applicable it's it's
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
really not about package food produ
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
production in its emphasis it's about
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know employee health and hygiene and
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
monitoring health and hygiene cooling
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
there there are yeah parts that come
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
into play but it's really not designed
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
for a home food producer or someone
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's making predominantly packaged
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
foods and I I really appreciate the
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
folks that have come to speak today
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
because one thing that's I mean these
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
these aren't our regulations we we have
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
to act to what the current law has and
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
but and I want to recognize is that
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
we've we've made changes to this law
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
over time we've it used to be income
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
limit based there used to be a $5,000
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
Homestead like if you made $5,000 or
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
less you were a tier one if you made
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
$10,000 or more you were tier two we
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
took away the income limits we we up the
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
income limits and then took the income
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
limits away we changed that now you can
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
sell products to retail stores and we've
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
done a little bit of changes over time
 
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
but kind of what I'm hearing is is this
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
still this still isn't maybe it wasn't
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
maybe what we were doing was trying to
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
incrementally change things but it
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
really wasn't what was going to help
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
small producers ultimately and I think
 
01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:14.679 align:start position:0%
what the the challenge for this
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee is is trying to figure out how
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
how can we frame something up to open
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
some doors but also have limitations to
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that things can there that the
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
sky is not the limit that that we're not
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
um becoming a fulls scale Bakery in in a
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
home kitchen um because that can lead to
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
other problems it could lead to food
 
01:12:39.149 --> 01:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
born illness it could lead to failed
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
septic systems is that that there are
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's like a spiraling thing to of
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
consideration but maybe there's
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for someone to make 10
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
pumpkin pies in a season like I but but
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the challenge before you
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
all is that to come up with something
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
that might makes sense but also
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing by opening that what also
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
can fall into that are we allowing home
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
Caterers are we allowing people to make
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
prepared prepared meals are we allowed
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
to make cheese in our bathtubs like we
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have to think about by giving an
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
inches that it might not just mean you
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
can make 10 pumpkin pies it can open the
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
window for for more things so that's
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
just just my um my as I I feel that
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
hearing from this that there's something
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
broken here I don't have the answers but
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
I can just present as to what the
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
current regulation is and and we really
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that too this is kind the
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
conversations that have to be had to
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
kind of tease out and figure out where
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
we want to go what we want to what we
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
want to see happen and and whether or
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
not you know those ideas are detrimental
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
or not uh representative
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
K thank you thank you madam chair um
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
sitting here listening
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
and um knowing that we're looking at a
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
home kitchen versus commercial kitchen
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
but somewhere there's something in
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
between um and that's where the
 
01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
disconnect is um because people don't
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
want to go full-blown commercial but yet
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
they want to make some foods that may be
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
temperature controlled but yet under the
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
homestead food act if you add commercial
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
equipment then you kind of moved away
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
from the homestead into the
 
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
commercial where if we're talking about
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
temperature controlled maybe we could
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
allow them to get a you know a specific
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
type of refrigerator or a freezer so
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
that they can that can be certified or
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
inspected so they can sell some
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
temperature controlled foods and maybe
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
we make it seasonal or specific to
 
01:14:56.669 --> 01:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
holidays um to start with um um so I'm
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
just throwing out some ideas and um but
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know but going from you know a
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
homestead to a commercial is a lot of
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
money and it's very expensive and it's
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
not doable for for most people
 
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.390 align:start position:0%
not doable for for most people
so

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you m chairman thank you oh
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead thank you thank you uh in
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
response to want to acquest to the
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
safety of our communities and allow
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
pumpkin pies chocolate dipped
 
01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.629 align:start position:0%
pumpkin pies chocolate dipped
strawberries

01:15:32.629 --> 01:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
strawberries
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
hummus um I have brainstormed with some
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
other local Bakers in my community
 
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
something that we are not sure whether
 
01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
it exists currently or not and I'm
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
calling it the uh 24 rule 24 in a 30-day
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
period 4 days where within a 24-hour
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
period pies could be made on site s sold
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
on site received on site it protects the
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
refrigeration it protects the consumer
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
in that direct conversation of I'm
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
taking this from my refrigerator you
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
must keep it refrigerated for your
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
safety it could be an option in a
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
direction to go to appease all parties I
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the degree and volume of what
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
you're doing but for eight pies in the
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
month of November the 24 rule of you get
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
4 days within that 30-day period 24
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
hours to produce those pies have your
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
consumers that pre-order pick up and
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
they must be out of your kitchen
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise they are no longer sailable
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
could be an option to visit in terms of
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
protecting our communities and still
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
allowing our homesteaders Artisan Bakers
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
whatever we call them
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
the freedom to do their trade and bring
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
more product to within the state on the
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't recall the exact wording but
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh elevated stance of a product and I
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
believe in New Hampshire we have the
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
ability to do that and we have the
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
ability right now to visit this
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
conversation on how Elevate that for our
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
Homestead Artisan producers so thank you
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh Addy yeah I just wanted to say
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that is the
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
most the pivotal Point within New
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that can be changed most
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
easily and most safely is the idea of
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
changing the occasional Food Service
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
establishment to an occasional food
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
establishment so that it includes the
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
sale of um items that are intended for
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
off- premise consumption instead of just
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
items for on premise consumption um and
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
it would be a very easy change it
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything about the
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
regulations of how the food is prepared
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
um it's already pretty much been proven
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
safe as we talked about that people can
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
make time temperature controlled for
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
food for safety Foods in their home
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
kitchens um safely so it doesn't change
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
that at all but it would allow producers
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
like us a lot more freedom um to
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
occasionally provide those typ products
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
for sale um and I kind of like wrote it
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
up a little bit if anyone wants to look
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
at yeah I I have your uh testimony I
 
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
wrote more because I get a little
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
involved um so it's a little bit more
 
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
extensive okay I'd like to um spend just
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
maybe 15 minutes um with representative
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
award to explain some of the highlights
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
of the legislation that she the
 
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
intentions that she had with that and
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
again you know this this bill as it
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
is um is not going to become law uh it
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
it right now I mean it's uh we're we're
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
studying this we're we're trying to
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe take pieces of what um what
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
we have and trying to incorporate that
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
into uh current current statute so um
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
but I just I wanted to get every
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
everybody to have a sense of of um the
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
intention of what this legislation was
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
so go ahead representative Alward
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you Madame
 
01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:33.149 align:start position:0%
and thank you Madame
chairman

01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I used to have a licensed home
 
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen back when it was required and I
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
made Gourmet brownies and I took them to
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
events and vended them so I was very
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with the laws I'm a former
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
wholesale and Retail Bakery um owner
 
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.270 align:start position:0%
wholesale and Retail Bakery um owner
Family

01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
Family
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
Bakery and I work for Safeway stores as
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
a head cake decorator for many years so
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
I take a keen interest in um baked goods
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
especially homemade baked goods uh that
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
I encounter in my
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
travels what I found as a vendor myself
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
was that there were people selling uh
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
temperature controlled
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
Foods uh which baffled me because it
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't allowed I learned that there
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't resources for inspections etc
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
etc um and just went on my Merry way and
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
most recently I helped a woman get into
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
the homemade food business which brought
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
me back to all these events and looking
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
at the homemade food vendors and the
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
labeling and being rather appalled by
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
the non-compliance it was absolutely
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
rampant uh when anything from caramel
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
that was Jarred in a can um made with
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
milk or cream um to fasha cheese uh you
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
just name it so I turned around and made
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
a public record request and this is well
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
before I was a legislator I had no idea
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
I would become elected to this position
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the time uh it was just out of
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
curiosity and being a formerly regulated
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
individual as a private investigator and
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
detective agency owner so once you're
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
kind of licensed you you like to play
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
the by the rules um so I asked DHHS for
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of food born illness originally
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
I got back answers that said there were
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
no complaints you know along the way the
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
house researcher came up with the three
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh in five
 
01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:52.669 align:start position:0%
uh in five
years

01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
so I then discovered the double standard
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
whereby nonprofits municipalities and
 
01:21:59.719 --> 01:22:00.990 align:start position:0%
whereby nonprofits municipalities and
private

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
Enterprise can set up an event
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
and not be regulated but by the homemade
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
foods that are brought to the donated to
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
these events so just over the past two
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
weekends I went to two separate events
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
one um featured C egg custard pie at
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
room temperature sitting out on the
 
01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.990 align:start position:0%
room temperature sitting out on the
tables

01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
tables
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
um it also had cream pies which are not
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
allowed for a homemade uh homemade food
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
producer to make and so I took the
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
custard pie I ate it I didn't get sick I
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
then went to another event where they
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
had pulled pork that was at tepid
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
temperature along with
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
klaw and I ate it and I didn't get
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
sick so um my biggest question here was
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
how can we have a double standard where
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
these nonprofits can take homemade foods
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
and sell them and serve them to
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
Consumers to attendees and we still have
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
these numbers of 20 letters and three
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know complaints over five years um
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
and I totally agree
 
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
with there's a liability involved if you
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
um don't make good food or save food Etc
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
but to this date I see zucchini bread
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
banana bread zucchini bread banana bread
 
01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
banana bread zucchini bread banana bread
sold

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
sold
 
01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere and quite frankly I leave my
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
banana bread on the counter for up to 3
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
days I don't like to refrigerate it um
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
nobody's gotten sick so
 
01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
the no one came up to me and said we
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
want to make these um uh temperature
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
controlled Foods nobody I was just
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh going through the internet and found
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
the Institute of justice and they rated
 
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a c minus for food
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
Freedom as in comparison to the other
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
laws uh states that have deregulated the
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
industry um so I called them up and I
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
said hey what would it take to make New
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire an
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
A+ and now I'm a legislator and I can
 
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
kind of do something about this so so
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
they help me formulate the language that
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
you see in this bill it's first time for
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
me I you know blindly trusted I I
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
fine-tuned it uh to what I was seeing in
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
the marketplace the reality of the
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
marketplace and put it in a
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
bill so this was my you know first bill
 
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
submission it got all caught up with
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
farmers markets and uh that had to
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
itl because I'd gotten bum
 
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.510 align:start position:0%
itl because I'd gotten bum
information

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
and what this problem is solving is to
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
make it fair and
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the homemade food
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
producer to produce Foods the same as
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
these nonprofits are allowed in my mind
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
you either regulate the
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofits just like us to make it fair
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
and reasonable
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
or you leave them alone and you let the
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
homemade food producers make more
 
01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.910 align:start position:0%
homemade food producers make more
different

01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
foods I don't see how you can reconcile
 
01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.390 align:start position:0%
foods I don't see how you can reconcile
the

01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
two as it is right
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
now so besides bringing uh New Hampshire
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
into line with the other states that
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
have different you know deregulation of
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
these Foods um um I suggested the
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
disclaimer on the label in in the name
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
of Public Safety for the TS or
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
perishable foods I like the idea of
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
warning warning perishable refrigerate
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
after purchase I like that so my
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
question for UNH I didn't catch your
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
name I'm so
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you y Wendy
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
um what if a panel of a student
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
you know industry folk were to get
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
together and formulate a type of
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
test that you know being boots on the
 
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
ground they they could have a better
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
feel for what might be offered
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
online is that kind of
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
possible so in terms of you're speaking
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
about educational materials that might
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
be built in with into the scope of the
 
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
be built in with into the scope of the
legislation

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's what you're speaking
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
to correct yeah um I think anytime you
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
are going to develop any educational
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
materials if you want them to be
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
effective you want folks to be weighing
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
in on what those educational materials
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
look like I mention the online piece I
 
01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the painfulness you speak to
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and whether it's effective or not I
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
think it really speaks to so yes I think
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
that if there are educational materials
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
and bringing in a variety of folks I
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can hear me to weigh
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
in on what the best content is or makes
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
complete sense I and I hope that anyone
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
who's involved in education would agree
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
with that okay okay so in the
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
interim of introducing this bill and
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
going out in the marketplace and
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
literally telling people that I'm
 
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
working on loosening up the laws um but
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time seeing
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliance um
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
there's been interest in dere but when I
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
say that they're thinking oh we no
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
longer have to label or I'm not labeling
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
now and I never will have to okay they
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
have this demented sort of uh concept of
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
what deregulation means and so
 
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.350 align:start position:0%
what deregulation means and so
compliance

01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
um I understand currently compliance is
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
dependent primarily upon members of the
 
01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.550 align:start position:0%
dependent primarily upon members of the
public

01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
reporting suspicions of
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and on the other hand
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
compliance to a homemade food producer
 
01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.750 align:start position:0%
compliance to a homemade food producer
May

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
May
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
mean um I I don't have to do this
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
because they're not inspecting us
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
because that's what I've heard out in
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
the market
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
place uh elevating the the image of the
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
industry putting out
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
PSAs twice annually as I suggest in my
 
01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.790 align:start position:0%
PSAs twice annually as I suggest in my
bill

01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
um will increase peer pressure out in
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
the marketplace I think uh increase
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
awareness the public might say hey
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
you're not labeled properly I'm not
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to buy your
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
product um I think the small batch idea
 
01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
for many of us or you I consider myself
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
a home made food producer and I'm not
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
but I feel like I should be um
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
anyway we we lost our refrigerator the
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
night before last it it went dead and we
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
had to put 15 pints of my companion's
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
fresh salsa in a cooler with ice but it
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
had fit reasonably on the middle shelf
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
refrigerator could he then go and vend
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
that salsa if it was allowed um safely
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
by transferring it to a cooler with ice
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
keeping it submerged and ice and you
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
know bending it from a location I do not
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
see why not I do not see how an ice fill
 
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
see why not I do not see how an ice fill
cooler

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
cooler
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
prohibits the sale of this product or
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
any product uh that that is in a sealed
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
container and can take being in ice or
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
dry ice so I understand the concerns the
 
01:30:27.629 --> 01:30:27.639 align:start position:0%
department I really really do but at the
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
same time uh Common Sense has to come
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
into play here at some point and I
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
believe the onus is on DHHS to
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
please prove their
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
concerns we're just hearing
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
speculation and I just believe that the
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
problem that's going to be solved is
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to create more business
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
opportuni ities it's going to put better
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
food out into the marketplace especially
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
in rural
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
areas and you know the woman with the
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
pot crock pot of baked beans mixed with
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
meat that was served at the old home day
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
uh should be able to sell that at a
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
vending event if she
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
wants it wasn't plugged
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
in the the product was
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
tepid but I ate it
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
so that's it in a nutshell folks I also
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
met this um lovely woman Linda Paulson
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
at a particular Market her products were
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
100% compliant I could have done you
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
know a cartwheel at that point because
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
none of the other vendors were in
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
compliance and it caused quite a Ruckus
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
at the at the market that I was looking
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
at and taking photographs of so I can
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
prove the DHHS because I'm a lawmaker
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
and I can no longer turn a blind eye to
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
this I can't in good conscience Public
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
Safety I'm going to start reporting the
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
non-compliance I run into but it upset a
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
lot of people you know they feel that
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to not follow the law
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
somehow I don't understand
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
so sure um go go ahead and then I I'd
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
like to hear from um Mr Johnson from
 
01:32:26.430 --> 01:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau you've been very quiet over
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
there I'd like to hear some some some
 
01:32:31.149 --> 01:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
comments where where your thoughts are
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
on this but first uh thank you fairw
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
woman um one of the things as as food
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
professionals I can say that I as
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
someone who generally takes a very dim
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
view of Regulation and Regulatory
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
Agencies I think DHHS finds himself in a
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
very um unenviable position of being
 
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
they have to attempt simultaneously to
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
be a regulatory enforcement agency as
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
well as a consumer advocacy agency as
 
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
well as a business advocacy agency and
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
so they're constantly playing all these
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
different angles so the position you're
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
in is difficult
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
um I when it comes to food safety this
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
is one of the few areas where I tend to
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
have uh a very gray and complex sort of
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
view of Regulation um because I've seen
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
what people do with food
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I I I have seen non-h handwashing
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen people move from
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
raw products to cooked products without
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
changing their gloves I mean every idea
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
that everything you can conceive where
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
you introduce unsafety to food
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
processing I have observed it I have
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
overseen the people doing it corrected
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
them over and over and over and they
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
keep doing it I understand how difficult
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
it is to keep things for the compliance
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
I also understand that food safety in
 
01:33:59.229 --> 01:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
terms of the way it's prepared is kind
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
of like running an Actuarial Table that
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know um there is a threshold where
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's not safe anymore and even beyond
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
that threshold most people won't get
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
sick but you reach a certain point where
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly a lot of people are sick and it
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't take much you don't you can't
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
really pinpoint where that point is so a
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
lot of the um uh a lot of the
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for food safety are
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
designed the way bridges are in
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
engineering where they actually are
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
rated for a weight and they are their
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
calculated weight is double that so um
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's an overabundance of caution
 
01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's being very careful with food and I
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
understand that I absolutely advocate
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
for it um but I think a lot of what we
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
what you found is that the
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliance is I think people there
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
is a there is a producer education
 
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
component that has to go into effect
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
here which is why I favor an envir which
 
01:34:54.239 --> 01:34:55.830 align:start position:0%
here which is why I favor an envir which
promotes

01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
promotes
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
professionalization um which makes it
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
viable for people to make this their
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
primary income and not a side hustle um
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
because those are people who are going
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
to take it more seriously so um in terms
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
of creating the Artisan food kind of
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
category I think that's an important
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction but I also
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the situation you're in
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
represent yes I'd like to S talk to um
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
the term side
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
hustle a lot of these vendor of small
 
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
batch food
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
items are
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
elderly and they're trying to make an
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
extra hundred bucks on a weekend to help
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
pay their taxes or buy their
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
medications or whatever I have never
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
seen anybody that even remotely looks
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
like a professional Homestead food
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
product uh person except for Miss
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
Paulson she is
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh beyond belief in her
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
operation so uh I think we have to look
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
at um the demographics of who's actually
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
vending these
 
01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.870 align:start position:0%
vending these
products

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe you had an intern that was
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
out in the marketplace is that cor and
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from her
 
01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.709 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from her
and

01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't see people becoming
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
professional Homestead that's not the
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
demographic I'm seeing out in the
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace I
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
I yeah sure but I I'd like to say I
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
think people from all walks of life all
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
ages um are are engaging in this because
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know they have a you know Grandma's
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
favorite recipe or whatever that they
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to share with the public and yeah
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
make a few extra bucks if they can yeah
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
um everybody is um you know seems to
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
want to share something at a farmers's
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
market or bring to a community dinner or
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
whatever MH um so yeah I don't I don't
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
see that it's any one particular
 
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:15.159 align:start position:0%
demographic it was all elderly no said
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
any are Mr Will Williams is it yes thank
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
you um I I just I want to clarify I
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with people doing
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
that what I'm describing is that the
 
01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:27.159 align:start position:0%
current regulatory structure um very
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
effectively precludes
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
professionalization it makes it very
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to make it your primary um to
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
make this type of business your primary
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
income so um I would like to open the
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
door to people to want to do that um
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
because that's what we want to do
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
frankly um and um you know I I can
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
assure you nothing unsafe is ever going
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
to leave our kitchen we've thrown away
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
stuff plenty already uh because we
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
didn't deem it had that be safe so
 
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
didn't deem it had that be safe so
representative

01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
kulan thank you madam chair yeah so I
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
think what I'm hearing over here is that
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
the best thing we can do legislatively
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
is to try and simplify our statutes
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
because what I'm hearing and you know I
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
don't like this idea of you out at
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
Farmers Market snitching on people that
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
I I'm a little worried for your health
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
and safety at that point Beyond food
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
born illness but
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh police okay good so uh you know if
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS wants to open up another you know
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
Homestead food Sheriff like you might be
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
good for that but so I think the best
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
thing that we can do is try with this
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
group is try and focus on streamlining
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
and simplifying and I I like where
 
01:38:49.709 --> 01:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
you're going with opening it up because
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
we do want it to be you know we want New
 
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when when people come here you
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
know when they're going you know Labor
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
Day camping or whatever they go to
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
Walmart they go to Market Basket or
 
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hanford and they get all their food and
 
01:39:06.669 --> 01:39:06.679 align:start position:0%
when they come to a small business they
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to see the same stuff chopped
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
up you know they want to see unique
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
stuff and so this helps our tourism
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
industry as well if we can have more
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
artisanal skilled people making very
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
high quality things that are better than
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
you can get the supermarket so I see it
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
as more as like a of a race to the top
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
than a race to the bottom and the best
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
thing like with
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
legislation every change that we make
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
it's a cause and effect so there's no
 
01:39:41.070 --> 01:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
like perfect utopian legislation we're
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
probably never going to wind up at this
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
perfect Mountaintop of legislation where
 
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
everything's perfect and no one has a
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
complaint cuz you know everything's
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to affect someone in a certain way
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
so I think the best thing we can do is
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
try and simplify and streamline and make
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
it easy for people to understand reading
 
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully grow a strong you
 
01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.669 --> 01:40:12.679 align:start position:0%
industry Mr
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
Johnson would you like to share your
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
thoughts on behalf of Farm
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau well we uh justess
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
initially um came involved took an
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
interest from representative Edwood stop
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
by our office last fall I guess when you
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
were looking at introducing the bills
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
and she had some ideas that that uh
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
brought in farmers markets and initially
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
we had had concerns with her her wanting
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh to open up a markets for artists and
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
producers but also drawing in the
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
farmers market definition and we see
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of that that definition
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
those those markets are for farmers are
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
important to us we there's an Integrity
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
to that so so and and um but it was
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
evident from talking with her that she
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
had done her homework and knew what she
 
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
was talking about and a lot of things
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense and we certainly um
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
as far far as the Artisan producers go
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
so I I think from what you're hearing
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
there definitely is as repr represent
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
ktoa mentioned kind of that doughnut
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
hole where there's that the there's an
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
area of of of uh food producers that are
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
are not being uh served like they could
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
be and need to be um um do you know of
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
any farms or Farm
 
01:41:27.639 --> 01:41:29.149 align:start position:0%
any farms or Farm
stands

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
stands
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
that have come to uh New Hampshire Farm
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
Bureau with suggestions of how they may
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
or how the law can change so that they
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
may be able to to um produce and sell
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
more varied product yeah not recently I
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
can say years ago prior to I know that
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
when the homestead food statue was was
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh became law that during that time
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
period yeah we had a lot of discussions
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
um more recently no not as not as much
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
um but I I do think just from from
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the potential of some of the
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions I can see where it would
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
would help some um some folks you know
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
on a small scale to to to you know get
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
their products into a wider a little bit
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
wider market and maybe from their
 
01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.430 align:start position:0%
wider market and maybe from their
upscale

01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
upscale
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
cuz I mean you know personally I would
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
love to see uh you know a farmer who is
 
01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
growing pumpkins be able to sell pumpkin
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
pies well that yeah and um you know or
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
if they they've they're beef producers
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
if they can do uh do up some sort of
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
casseroles and put them in their freezer
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
because they already have a farm stand
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
that has a freezer or refrigerator if
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
they could uh you know do do those um
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
kinds of meals uh based on the products
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they're actually raising on their
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
on their Farm uh I think that that would
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
be you know something spectacular for
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
them yeah now most definitely I I can
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
see we have uh Farmers that sell selling
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
turkeys you know uh harvested on the
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
farm under the exemption and adding
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
pumpkin pies to that you're going to
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
have those consumers are going to you
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
know One-Stop shopping type thing be a
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
benefit I I I do have and I don't know I
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if uh um the department has
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
had a chance to see that the the letter
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
that you had uh email you had uh
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
provided me from um from eer Farm
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
regarding they they have a have you have
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
they have a uh a a licensed uh Dairy
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
kitchen and then they aren't able to do
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
some things and I was curious there why
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
think you think that could be something
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
done there as well because they do have
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
a established license facility um but I
 
01:43:54.149 --> 01:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
can I can talk with you later about that
 
01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the the other question I do have
 
01:43:57.550 --> 01:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of aside from all this
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
is I i' listening to some of the
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
producers here my I have a question
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
about insurance about how you're dealing
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
with that and it's aside from the
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
legislation I know but I can talk to to
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
you folks off offline here but that's a
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
question I have is how there how are you
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with that
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
okay so um represent cible oh sorry goad
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
um just for us to sell at at markets
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
they required a million doll policy on
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
General um product liability on it so to
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
be a part of any of the farmers markets
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
that we sell at they they required us to
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
have a commercial um liability I guess
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
my question is have you discussed with
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
them the bill this that's what it would
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
what their response would be there so in
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
terms of our our insurance actually
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change because they we went
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
through an insurance company that is you
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
know 50 State whatever and all the
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
answering all the questions none of it
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
had to do with um uh refrigerated types
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
of foods or anything like that it was it
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
was more of um was it uh the um General
 
01:45:09.629 --> 01:45:09.639 align:start position:0%
types of things but not it didn't get
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
into that specific of a there are there
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
are you can go more you know you could
 
01:45:17.149 --> 01:45:17.159 align:start position:0%
do there was there was opportunities to
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
have more coverage but the basic million
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
generic okay um sure Colleen I I just
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
want uh just a couple additional points
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
is I I know that we have talked about
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
the complaint number of complaints that
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
we've received and reports of food born
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
illness but it it and and I appreciate
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
that you didn't get sick when you ate
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
that that pork but but we we have to
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes these illnesses are under
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
reported many times they're under
 
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
reported so people can have a stomach
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
bug get better don't go to the doctor we
 
01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
don't know about that we don't know
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
where they we don't know if they made it
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
at home if they went to a a restaurant
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
and got sick they went to the um the
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
church dinner and got sick those some
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
some things are undetected by us so it
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that just because we don't
 
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
have reports of them that they're not
 
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
happening we have to look at the
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
possibility of of we know that
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
microorganisms grow when they're out of
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
temperature control under certain
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
conditions and so we have to protect
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
against that and I I just want to
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
caution us caution is is that while we
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
are supportive of growing Local Foods
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
and the ability for consumers to get
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
access to Local Foods it it doesn't mean
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
that they have to be unsafe foods it is
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
that food in a Haniford versus food at a
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
farmers's market should be equally safe
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
and and just because you want to
 
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
purchase your food from a local farmer
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that we should
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
sacrifice on food safety um one thing
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we have we've bounced around this
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
idea is is potentially having a a like a
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
voluntary seal of quality or a seal of
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
of food safety is is having appreciating
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
that there might be the gamut of people
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
that are really focused and dedicated
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
and want to get invest in equipment to
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
to make more food is having some kind of
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's licensing or
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
registration proof of having it
 
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
attending an educational requirement
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
proof of having um an interface with an
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
inspector that they haven't he's giving
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
me a thumbs up th thumbs up is is me and
 
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know there are similar programs I'm
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about apple cider thinking
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
about honey where these are voluntary
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
voluntary programs within the Department
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture but maybe something that
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
could bridge that Gap is that we're just
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
not opening the opening the doorway to
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
more products without some kind of
 
01:47:45.229 --> 01:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
oversight because what what I'm hearing
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
is is that this lack of oversight and
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not advoc because I also know our
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
resource limitations is that we there's
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of there's 5,000 licensed places
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
that we have we don't get to as as often
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
as we could let alone farmers markets is
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
is some way of building in those those
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
protections um because it sounds like um
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know as best as we've tried to make
 
01:48:11.589 --> 01:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
some decisions trying to um look at risk
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
and and allow lowrisk Foods is that
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
we're still missing the mark As far as
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
either people aren't um abiding by that
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
or they're not labeling things correctly
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
is is that there we're still missing the
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
mark somehow so that's just one thought
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we have kind of bounced around as a
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
as an idea of maybe how something could
 
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.470 align:start position:0%
as an idea of maybe how something could
work

01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
but okay Addie yeah I want to talk about
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
two things and one is just a response to
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
that um the state that we used to live
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
in Virginia has a very Rob robust
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
homebased food producer system um where
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
you can make refrigerated items you can
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
basically do anything you could do in a
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen you can do in your
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
home kitchen as long as you're labeling
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
it correctly um and the reason that they
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
have that is because they have an
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
extensive um inspection system for
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
homebased food producers as well as
 
01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:01.790 align:start position:0%
homebased food producers as well as
extensive

01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
like uh resources to help them be safe
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
so it might be worth looking at some of
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
those resources that Virginia already
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
has because they have food safety stuff
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
that is tailored to the home producer
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
which can be kind of different from the
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant um producer so that's one
 
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
thing um the second thing is kind of
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
about the importance of homebased
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
industry um I kind of wanted to tell a
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
little bit very short story about my
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
background um so my great-grandmother
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
immigrated to the US from Bellar Russia
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh in around 1900 she did not speak any
 
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
English she didn't read or right she
 
01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
spoke only Yiddish she live she met my
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather who was a ragman and
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
if you don't know what that is it's
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
someone who carries a sack of rags and
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
sells them on the street and so he would
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
like ride the trolleys around Pittsburgh
 
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
and sell these Rags uh she and her
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
sister took in like mending and also did
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
baked goods from their home my
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
grandmother her daughter was the first
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
person to graduate from high school in
 
01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
the family and she took like an
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
accounting course and then did as sort
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
of side work while her husband was in
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
the military accounting from their
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
kitchen table in the evenings to bring
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
in extra money my mom went to law school
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
and she ended up quitting her corporate
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
job so that she could stay home and also
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
while doing her law career be with me
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:39.149 --> 01:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
little being able to
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
produce money and income for your family
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
from resources that you already have at
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
home is like a Cornerstone of the
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
American dream and of economic Mobility
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that should also be
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
considered when you're you're thinking
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
about this bill it's not just about pies
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just about Refrigeration it's
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
not just about you know Local Foods it's
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
also about do families in this state
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
have the ability to move upwards
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
economically and do they have the
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
ability to do things that don't require
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know college or don't require Long
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
training programs that they won't have
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
to work at McDonald's for the rest of
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
their lives because they can take
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
something that they're good at and that
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
they want to improve upon and actually
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
benefit from that labor so I hope you'll
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
consider that as well I
 
01:51:32.589 --> 01:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
ahead we can sell the products yeah I
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
just want like seriously we just want to
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
be able to make money doing the things
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
that we're doing and not have to go back
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
to like working minimum wage because
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's why you get paid as a line follow
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair followup sure the reason I
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
suggested the term Artisan versus home
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
stead is because persons well many um
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
producers are not home steuding they're
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
not growing their own foods and
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
processing them and selling them you
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
could be in an apartment in Manchester
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
making cupcakes but you're not
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
homesteading and the term Artisan uh is
 
01:52:19.310 --> 01:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
very much in use in marketing these days
 
01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.109 align:start position:0%
very much in use in marketing these days
and

01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
um it is also being used here in New
 
01:52:25.870 --> 01:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by the conquered farmers
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
market that wants to promote farmers and
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
Artisans um Canan farmers market and
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
Artisans is how it's
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
advertised uh wilmet Farmers Market
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
features The
 
01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:43.069 align:start position:0%
features The

01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
Artisans
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
and this is what many people Express to
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
me that they want to be called that they
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
are producing um
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
not a high school you know baking
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
experiment it is quality handmade and
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's what Artisan means handmade um
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
Foods so not everybody lives on a farm
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
or can relate to the term
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
Homestead uh I had boasted that I had
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
not found that term used through the
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%

01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh in advertising Google searching until
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
I met Miss
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
Paulson whose company is called yummy
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
cupcakes and at the top of her card it
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
says Homestead
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
kitchen so that kind of blew my um uh
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
assertion out of the
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
water and I asked Miss Paulson I said if
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
we were able to change the term to
 
01:53:50.589 --> 01:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
Artisan would it be a financial burden
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
to change your marketing material
 
01:53:54.669 --> 01:53:54.679 align:start position:0%
and and would you be in favor of the
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
term Artisan over Homestead so if she

respond
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you uh my response was
 
01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
initially I felt a sense of uh belonging
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
in my Homestead title because the
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
product was coming from my home I do
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the elevation of becoming an
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
artisan uh producer within my Artisan
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
home kitchen because again I believe
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
that we could Elevate what the state of
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has to offer within its
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
tourism within its local
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
communities and in The Duality of
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
artisan and potentially a New Hampshire
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
seal of approval I think that you could
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
essentially get a gold star when folks
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
are coming into our state and
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
stopping along Route 4 or
 
01:54:59.790 --> 01:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
101 wherever they may be and finding a
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
market that has a Artisan product with
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
an Hampshire seal of approval that
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
they've met standards for safety and Etc
 
01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:13.310 align:start position:0%
they've met standards for safety and Etc
uh

01:55:13.310 --> 01:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:14.910 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:19.629 --> 01:55:19.639 align:start position:0%
I believe that the Improvement to
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
Artisan uh would benefit
 
01:55:25.950 --> 01:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
the state the bill and the producers
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
finding happy ground for the
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
farm I don't know that someone who is
 
01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.109 align:start position:0%
farm I don't know that someone who is
producing

01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
producing
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
um something with their beef I I don't
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
recall exactly what you mentioned but I
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
don't know that they want to come away
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
from that Homestead aspect and I think
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a question of how many
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
farmers exist within what we are
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
currently considering that Homestead um
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the products the the
 
01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
pies the hummus the cupcakes um I would
 
01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
approve and appreciate U being elevated
 
01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:10.750 align:start position:0%
approve and appreciate U being elevated
to

01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
Artisan interesting okay Miss Smith I I
 
01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
would uh I would Advocate not moving
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
away from Artisan just because I I feel
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
like there's already so much confusion
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
around home the around home Foods is
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
changing the terminology just might add
 
01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
to the confusion plus I don't think it
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
could limit I mean you could be a small
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
producer in a in a shop and make an
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
artisan food it wouldn't necessarily
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
limit you to being a home food producer
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
with that terminology and whereby you
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
generally Most states refer to it as a
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
homestead or Cottage Foods Artisan I
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
think would it might create confusion as
 
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:52.750 align:start position:0%
think would it might create confusion as
to

01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
that it's meant to be in a home kitchen
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
setting that would that's just my just
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
just in hearing the challenges that
 
01:57:02.069 --> 01:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
we've had around Homestead regulations
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
is I I think it might just create
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
confusion while I think it's very well
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
intentioned and I understand the need
 
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
for an elevation and elevation and
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
terminology I I I would just caution
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
about changing the terminology with what
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
people are have been familiar with for
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
for many many
 
01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:23.560 align:start position:0%
years you may thank you madam chair um
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
it is a 50/50 split for me because I
 
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
would like to accommodate our Farmers
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
within that and the
 
01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:33.430 align:start position:0%
within that and the
homestead

01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
homestead
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
um Elevate to an artisan or leave me at
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
Homestead and give me a New Hampshire
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
seal of approval something that we can
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
bring forward to just bolster the system
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
bolster what the products that can be
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
offered if we can get those pies out
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
there and get give us more freedom um
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
loosen what the law currently has but
 
01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:00.910 align:start position:0%
loosen what the law currently has but
find

01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
find
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
potentially a course uh whether it's an
 
01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
online CBT which is dreaded my career as
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
well I'm familiar uh but it it is an
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
easy access way
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
to have a bit more oversight if we're
 
01:58:25.149 --> 01:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
loosening opening the door door to more
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
freedom okay all right thank you Mr
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
Williams just wanted to add something a
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
little bit you know the the example I
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier where I can produce
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
TCS food safely with a $2,000
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
refrigerator in my home kitchen as
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to spending $100,000 building a
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen um I think that
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
speaks to the economic Mobility my wife
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned um right now we can we can buy
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
a $2,000 refrigerator
 
01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't have $100,000 to spend on
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
that kitchen I either have to go into
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
significant debt in order to do that
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
which I'd have to use my our property to
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
secure and I I can speak about debt
 
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
destroying small businesses I've watched
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
it happen many times but the point is I
 
01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
want that commercial kitchen because
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be more efficient and work
 
01:59:22.109 --> 01:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
better a a purpose design commercial
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
kitchen is much easier to work in
 
01:59:26.109 --> 01:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
producing commercial quantities of food
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
than a home kitchen that's been adapted
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
for sure I want to build that kitchen if
 
01:59:33.629 --> 01:59:33.639 align:start position:0%
I if if the law allows me to make TCS
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
Foods in that home kitchen with the
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment added then I have a
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
stepping stone to that I can use that to
 
01:59:43.229 --> 01:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
raise that
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and buy that new kitchen for
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
cash instead of going into debt so my
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
business becomes more viable so that we
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
have one more small business in New
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where 98 cents on every dollar
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
someone spends stays in New Hampshire so
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's there's like an enormous
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
incentive to allow this and I definitely
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand wanting to control the way
 
02:00:07.229 --> 02:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
it's done so that it's safe and it's not
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly but um you know perhaps we
 
02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
don't mess with our Homestead
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
regulations so we create a new category
 
02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:17.719 align:start position:0%
of artisan foods and add it on and if
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
somebody because somebody can be doing
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
artist and be doing something a little
 
02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:20.790 align:start position:0%
artist and be doing something a little
bit

02:00:20.790 --> 02:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
different I I I mean I suppose that's a
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
possibility because again yeah there's
 
02:00:26.109 --> 02:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
definitely people who want to stick with
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
that Homestead thing there's definitely
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
a a connotation there's a subtext to
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
Homestead as opposed to Artisan that
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
communicates something and again from
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
your standpoint just changing the name
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
on everything suddenly creates a lot of
 
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
confusion and especially if you then
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
change some of the rules now you've got
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
a whole another layer of confusion to
 
02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:45.639 align:start position:0%
deal with but if you don't change this
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
and just add something add a capability
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
that is allowed allow a new thing that
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty simple and
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward representative kto thank
 
02:00:58.069 --> 02:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I want to address a
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
um what would you see legislation
 
02:01:06.069 --> 02:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
looking like in order for you to do the
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
stepping stone um in order for you to
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
not be to have some commercial equipment
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
but not be a commercial kitchen um and
 
02:01:19.229 --> 02:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
getting that Comm to get to that next
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
level so just an idea to be honest I
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty simple um the uh
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
engineering requirements for commercial
 
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
grade refrigeration and commercial
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
appliances is extremely well- defined
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's not if you go to say
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
restaurantsupply.com or webstaurant and
 
02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
you search for commercial
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
equipment that if it says commercial on
 
02:01:45.069 --> 02:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
that website it meets the standard that
 
02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
is extremely well enforced it is
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
extremely organized everyone understands
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
it that needs to and then there are also
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
very there are already requirements
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
built into the code for how commercial
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
equipment is powered it has to be on its
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
own circuit it has to have this type of
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
breaker it has to be GFI all that stuff
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
already exists it's not that hard to do
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
so you would just first off there is
 
02:02:09.629 --> 02:02:09.639 align:start position:0%
language um that prohibits the use of
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment in home kitchens
 
02:02:13.629 --> 02:02:13.639 align:start position:0%
just get rid of it just get rid of it
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
and then apply when people do put
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment in you just apply
 
02:02:20.510 --> 02:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
the same requirements for that equipment
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
that you would in a commercial kitchen
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's not that complicated um you know
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
wiring is wiring um you know wi you know
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
Breakers are Breakers um you know uh I'd
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
be I'd say that like I don't necessarily
 
02:02:37.069 --> 02:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
think there's that much to gain by
 
02:02:38.589 --> 02:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
requiring air gap plumbing and
 
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
handwashing stations and all like some
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that is required for a
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen stainless steel work
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
surfaces that stuff is really
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
expensive stainless steel work surfaces
 
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
only stay sanitary if you sanitize them
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
properly anyway
 
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think some of the requirements
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
there are some requirements that are
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
more important than others I guess is
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying for food safety and
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration is like number one like
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
that is the most important safety
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
equipment in any kitchen yeah well and
 
02:03:07.709 --> 02:03:07.719 align:start position:0%
training um which for us isn't an issue
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
but like if you have employees making
 
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
sure that there is some sort of food
 
02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
handler certification which already
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
exists that is I think pretty
 
02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.510 align:start position:0%
exists that is I think pretty
reasonable

02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
so what prevents you from becoming a
 
02:03:23.679 --> 02:03:27.069 align:start position:0%
so what prevents you from becoming a
commercial

02:03:27.069 --> 02:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
kitchen hold on no no no I'm I'm not
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
asking why you're not a I I'm not
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
talking about dollars I'm talking about
 
02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
as you add commercial
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
equipment what then disqualifies you
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
from being the commercial kitchen when
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
when you've already upped your standards
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to I'm playing devil's
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
advocate here so you've upped your
 
02:03:53.709 --> 02:03:53.719 align:start position:0%
standards you've increased your uh
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
capacity uh to make foods because you've
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
added commercial equipment
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
Etc how do you differentiate you being a
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
homestead versus a commercial from
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
everybody else so I'm just I'm just
 
02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:11.390 align:start position:0%
everybody else so I'm just I'm just
talking

02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
talking
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
about you know when do you get when do
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
you get to be the commercial kitchen you
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
know what is the requirement when do you
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
step over that line
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
I mean because we've eliminated the
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
dollar amount on what you can sell from
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
your home so basically what I'm saying
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
is if you had all the commercial
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
equipment in your home then technically
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
you would be a commercial kitchen
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
without without any dollar limits so I'm
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to find out where that how
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
we differentiate and I'm not advocating
 
02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
one way or the other I'm just asking I I
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
actually um I think there's two aners to
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
this one um if we're building a kitchen
 
02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
from scratch there are a lot there's
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
this a long list of requirements that
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of materials are on
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
your walls um what kind of insulation
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
you can use um what kind of how many
 
02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
candles of lighting you have in your
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
storage there's a lot of details that go
 
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
into that that are way above and beyond
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
what you can even do in a home kitchen
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
so I think um for one it's going to be
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
really easy to differentiate from if
 
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
you're an inspector between someone's
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
home kitchen that has commercial
 
02:05:27.069 --> 02:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
equipment um and an actual like groundup
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen um the other thing
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
um uh is
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
that you know why why do we need to have
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
a distinction between my kitchen and a
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen if the food is safe
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
why like what what is the point of
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah just a side note that you know
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
we're hearing about this one their
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
particular situation but if we do allow
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
the homestead food you know situation to
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
grow we're going to be actually growing
 
02:06:09.549 --> 02:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
the commercial kitchen um business as
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
well because if someone's on a small
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
scale and they're starting to have
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
success at a farmers market and then
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
they pick up another one they're not
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
just going to try and make more and more
 
02:06:23.549 --> 02:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
food food from their kitchen eventually
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to go out so if if
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
he if they're saying there's you know
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh you know entry fee into that
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
business other people that already
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
operate commercial kitchens are GNA want
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
to open another one or other PE people
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
are a smart person is going to say why
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
do I want to get into the food business
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
what I could get into the commercial
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
kitchen business you know like so you
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
know if we open this up a little bit I
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
think we'll see growth in uh that
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
industry for sure oh I I absolutely
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
agree I mean we've looked into buying
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
some commercial appliances and it's like
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
if we do that and if I ever wanted to do
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
Homestead then I'm disqualified so I
 
02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
understand exactly where you're coming
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
from I'm just trying to look at it from
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
all sides so um we've like struggled
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
with ways to kind of regulate scale and
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
the first bill I worked on we got rid of
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
the dollar thing so so now it's like
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do regulate the
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
size of your fridge like that's what
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing kind I know it's it's a
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:35.750 align:start position:0%
little bit
weird

02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
weird
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to speak to that
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
question as well I think anyone who's
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
making food out of their home either
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
wants to stay a manageable size within
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
their home or they want to graduate to a
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
purpose-- driven space I don't think
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
there are of people who would
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
voluntarily just run a commercial
 
02:07:55.629 --> 02:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
kitchen for the rest of their lives out
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
of their kitchen because it is horrible
 
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's like butter completely filling
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
your fridge so you can't put your like
 
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
normal meal stuff in there it's like
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's a I mean it's a nightmare from like
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
a living standards perspective because
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
you're always prioritizing the business
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
over your own standard so the goal is
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
always I think for people who want to
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
produce a lot of food to get to the
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
point where you can afford that that
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
beautiful shiny space where there's
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
refrigerators and there's extra ovens
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
and there's you know an ice maker
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
instead of having to like go to the
 
02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:29.559 align:start position:0%
store in the morning to get the ice and
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
like make sure there's actually room in
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
your freezer for the bag of ice and all
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
of that so there is there is that um and
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
then there's also something that's
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
already pretty much built into the law
 
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
as it exists now um which is that
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
homebased kitchens are producing
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
packaged Foods versus producing um like
 
02:08:49.069 --> 02:08:49.079 align:start position:0%
hot held catering food and that's
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
already in the statute so I don't think
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
that changing to being able to make um
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
TCS packaged Foods is going to get you
 
02:08:58.510 --> 02:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
into a situation where you'll have
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
people running little restaurants from
 
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
their homes although technically that is
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
kind of legal with the occasional Food
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
Service establishment stuff already so I
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's really a conflict
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
thanks and speaking to that yes uh I
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
currently go to my market and I bring
 
02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to 12 dozen cupcakes um
 
02:09:25.559 --> 02:09:27.069 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to 12 dozen cupcakes um
which

02:09:27.069 --> 02:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
are certainly elevated compared to the
 
02:09:33.270 --> 02:09:33.280 align:start position:0%
standard cupcake and I sell out most of
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
the time my kitchen is limited under the
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
law and therefore uh my ability to grow
 
02:09:47.229 --> 02:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
is stunted currently if I could bring in
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
a commercial refrigerator to allow me to
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
keep more volume of butter my shortening
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
is stable it sits on the Shelf my eggs I
 
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
need a space to do that I have my family
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
knows and this is a a little inside bit
 
02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
my family knows that the beginning of
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
December that first week after
 
02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving the shopping stops because
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
I need my refrigerator for eggs butter
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
and buttermilk because I'm going to
 
02:10:25.149 --> 02:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
a city tree lighting that has requested
 
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
42 dozen cupcakes for
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
one8 hour period And I pulled it off
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
last year for the first time and they
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
asked me back if I had that ability to
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
have one more
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
refrigerator I
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
could I could Elevate myself so
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
that's so so what I'm hearing
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
I mean DHHS probably won't like it but
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
if we could just remove the word
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
commercial appliances from the
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
statute that might solve a lot of the
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
issues that we're sitting here hearing
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
um um Madam
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
chair I would suggest instead of just
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
removing no commercial equipment you
 
02:11:17.709 --> 02:11:17.719 align:start position:0%
could say any equipment that you can
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
effectively like sanitize wash sanitize
 
02:11:24.350 --> 02:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
um and store would be kind of a better
 
02:11:27.189 --> 02:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
language because it would any equipment
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
that you can
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
effectively um wash and sanitize because
 
02:11:33.790 --> 02:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
I think one of the concerns that DHHS
 
02:11:35.470 --> 02:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
has put um has sort of put in their
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
materials is that a lot of commit
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen stuff is bigger so
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's harder to wash in your home sink um
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
so just putting something on there so
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
that it's you know you can't use a
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
mixing bowl that's like bigger than your
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
ability to clean it um um is kind of an
 
02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
important thing but just speaking to the
 
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
the commercial refrigeration and the
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment having a ban on
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment in Homestead food
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
operations actually makes it harder to
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
be safe because you can't use the NSF
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
stuff that is certified to be really
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
easy to clean or you're not supposed to
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
um and it's also really it's not really
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
enforceable it's not like DHHS can come
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
into your house anyway and look for it
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
unless they suspect a problem and so it
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
really punishes people who are volunt
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
following the law instead of the people
 
02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
who are just like yeah I'm going to
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
break the law because no one can check
 
02:12:27.669 --> 02:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
so why even have it in there if it's
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
going to punish the people who you want
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
to have making food because they want to
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
do it
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
safely I really like this yeah you like
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
to and I I really so I think I think
 
02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
where we're we're maybe going a little
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
bit off track is is that commercial
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
kitchen commercial equipment isn't
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
required and I think it also speaks to
 
02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
when people bring in like an industrial
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
siiz mixer that's leads to other that
 
02:12:57.629 --> 02:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
leads to the other problems and and also
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
people are bound by space not everyone
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
has space to have a walk-in cooler in
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
their house it it's not that we're
 
02:13:05.709 --> 02:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
Banning commercial equipment it's not
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment isn't required it
 
02:13:11.229 --> 02:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
says on your website that it is banned
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it's prohibits not say and I I
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
think when we're not I think we're
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
looking at where it's the it's the
 
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
equipment so again it's going to your
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hobart mixers these large industrial
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
siiz mixers or steam kettles like we
 
02:13:27.149 --> 02:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
these weren't these are it's not
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
standard um home equipment so I I don't
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
want to create Confusion by saying we're
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to someone adding a piece of
 
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
equipment like a refrigerator that's
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
going to allow them to produce food
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
safety so we are allowed to do that
 
02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
because it says it says on your website
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
that you can't use commercial equipment
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we've all been operating
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
under the idea of that is absolutely
 
02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
true because we've thought about getting
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
a commercial refrigerator and it's just
 
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
you can't if you want to do Homestead so
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
I think it's becoming to the point where
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
the homestead food operation was
 
02:14:04.589 --> 02:14:04.599 align:start position:0%
designed to it had it like inherit in
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
limitations to you weren't supposed to
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
have a a commercial operation in your
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
house because people are limited in size
 
02:14:13.430 --> 02:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the idea was you don't want them
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
going into garage spaces or basement
 
02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
spaces to add capacity and equipment so
 
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
if there's if we can you know certainly
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
have discussions offline if there's
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
something you know we're not we're not
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
going we're not in the habit of making a
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
a situation unsafe just because of
 
02:14:31.950 --> 02:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
crafting out language but but I think
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
where we're going down the road is it's
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's the installing commercial equipment
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
could lead to other problems and also
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the inherent footprint
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
of what a home kitchen is designed to do
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to like Spiral down to a
 
02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole but there can be other there
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
could be un other intendent consequences
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
certainly your septic capacity is is
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
another thing that if you did have a
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
commercial operation you would be
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
required to have a an aseptic system
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's sized appropriately if you're
 
02:15:07.709 --> 02:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
having a baking operation that where you
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
are bringing in extra Refrigeration
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
extra ovens extra mixers certainly you
 
02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
might that you might have other
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences from that
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
operation okay one more
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
one more comment and I think you know
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
we've already run over time and I don't
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
want to keep everybody here all
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon um possibly we may have um
 
02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.310 align:start position:0%
afternoon um possibly we may have um
another

02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
meeting um to discuss possibilities for
 
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh a bill for next year or something um
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
so i' just like to kind of let Addie
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
speak and then kind of wrap it up if
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
that's okay with
 
02:15:50.350 --> 02:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
everyone um I just wanted to say that
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
because it's your home kitchen it's too
 
02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
small to produce a lot of food is kind
 
02:15:57.870 --> 02:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
of it's kind of something someone who's
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
never worked in a restaurant would say
 
02:16:01.870 --> 02:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
because every restaurant that I've ever
 
02:16:04.549 --> 02:16:04.559 align:start position:0%
worked in was a lot smaller the kitchen
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
space was a lot smaller than our home
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
kitchen and our home kitchen is not big
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
like I'm talking you can crank out food
 
02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:11.709 align:start position:0%
like I'm talking you can crank out food
for

02:16:11.709 --> 02:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
like 120 people in like a very small
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
period of time from a station that's as
 
02:16:20.549 --> 02:16:20.559 align:start position:0%
big as this not even this whole table
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
like this two-piece table it's not hard
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
you just have to be organized and you
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
just have to work hard and like be very
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
precise and think a lot about your menu
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and what you're going to serve so the
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.750 --> 02:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
inherent cap on what you can do in a
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
home kitchen is kind of it's not really
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
true and so it's not really part of what
 
02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
the law even says now because there
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a cap on it it's like you can do
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
what you can do in your home kitchen so
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
if you're good at it you should be able
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
to produce a bit of food and there's no
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
reason not to if you're doing it safely
 
02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
as far as we're concerned the two main
 
02:16:59.070 --> 02:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
considerations are the fact that it's
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
very clear that commercial equipment is
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited if we could clear that up
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
that would be great and also being able
 
02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
to produce at least some TCS Foods out
 
02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
of a homestead kitchen and if there are
 
02:17:14.669 --> 02:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
extra requirements on you know that
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
kitchen on training all that stuff is
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
totally reasonable but just being able
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
to have the option again going back to
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
what the market is looking for people
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
some people are interested in whole raw
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
ingredients far more people
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly more people are looking
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
for prepared foods and in order to have
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
a viable food-based
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
business we are very limited in our
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
ability to do that if we cannot sell
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
them prepared
 
02:17:46.110 --> 02:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
foods at
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
some okay all right well I want to thank
 
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
everybody for taking the time to come
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%

02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
important um to hear um you know what

solve some of the issues
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
that our food producers have been
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing and um so again I want to
