00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
have a quorum so um
 
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
i call the committee back out of lunch
 
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.549 align:start position:0%
i call the committee back out of lunch
recess

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
and ms rounds are you ready to roll
 
00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
so i think i think matt
 
00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
is in the audience to cover 37 so if you
 
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
want to do that
 
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
first and then i can roll with my
 
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
footnotes because i'm not sure what his
 
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
availability is
 
00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
hey matt welcome back mr chairman good
 
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh can we can we get uh section 37
 
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
pulled up
 
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
how you doing today uh very good how are
 
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's a great day when uh ways and means
 
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
are you here to give us the oh you can't
 
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can't give us the ways and means
 
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.030 align:start position:0%
you can't give us the ways and means
update

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
update
 
00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh i i would defer to them on that that
 
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have good news soon
 
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
though

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
you can you can begin if you'd like
 
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so section 37
 
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
is a fairly straightforward one-time
 
00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation of one and a half million
 
00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.389 align:start position:0%
appropriation of one and a half million
dollars

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
directed towards combating social
 
00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.469 align:start position:0%
directed towards combating social
isolation

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
and making capital improvements in
 
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
spaces such as senior centers
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of the inspiration behind this
 
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation in house bill
 
00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
2 is that we know the pandemic has hit
 
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
older granite staters harder than anyone
 
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
else and as part of coming out of coven
 
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
and encouraging people to get back out
 
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
into their routines and socialize
 
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
we know that some of these types of
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
structures across the state
 
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
could use money of this nature to make
 
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
capital upgrades or just
 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
other things uh whether it be
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
programming or
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
to make seniors feel safe returning to
 
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
these spaces
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
and that's the inspiration behind this
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions but
 
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have too much more than that
 
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay i did have some questions
 
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility is this
 
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
only for county nursing homes is it for
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
all i i understand we have something
 
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.030 align:start position:0%
all i i understand we have something
like

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
240 or 260 nursing homes
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
statewide is everyone eligible
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
what what's the eligibility around this
 
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
so we would support broad eligibility
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
this would be something that dhhs would
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
need to determine as the legislation is
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
silent on it
 
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
but essentially this would be an
 
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide grants or
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
potentially matching grants
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
to these entities um
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
and again for the purpose that i've
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
already gone through whatever they might
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
encourage people to socialize and try to
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
mitigate those negative mental health
 
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.710 align:start position:0%
mitigate those negative mental health
impacts

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh that we know the pandemic has wrought
 
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.229 align:start position:0%
uh that we know the pandemic has wrought
representative

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for being here
 
00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
again um
 
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
i was wondering what would be the
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
process health and human services
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
would put out some sort of an rfp
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
or information so that um
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
senior centers could apply i mean these
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
aren't just nursing homes right these
 
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
these could be
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
senior centers in local communities
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
meal sites where seniors gather
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes anything of that nature i
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't believe nursing homes are
 
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
specifically called out i think it is
 
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
more of that community aspect
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
and if the committee feels that we need
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
to add the word
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
competitive process or something along
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
just to ensure you know there's some
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
structure to what hhs would ultimately
 
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.949 align:start position:0%
structure to what hhs would ultimately
deploy

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
deploy
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have any concerns there um
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
but again i think the the department
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
would have that broad discretion on how
 
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
would have that broad discretion on how
to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
you see this going to many
 
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
senior centers across the state not just
 
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.510 align:start position:0%
senior centers across the state not just
to

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
one or two that have already been chosen
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
correct this there's no predetermination
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
on where these funds would go
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
or even the size of the grants we see
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
this as a problem statewide and we know
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
it's a small investment
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
but we would want to make some type of
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
an investment through the through the
 
00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
an investment through the through the
budget

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
um again just to come out of this
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic and make sure that people
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in the spaces that they
 
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
regularly enjoyed prior to the pandemic
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
you still have the floor if you have
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
other questions well i guess i
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
one the only other question i really
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
have is
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
this is another new um
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for health and human
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
services and i wondered
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
um where exactly this might
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
happen in health and human services and
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not they've really got the
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to do this program at this
 
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to do this program at this
point

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i think you're right it's um
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
certainly infrastructure is a is a
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
problem for a lot of these
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
organizations so i wonder if you've
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
explored that though whether the whether
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
health and human services really has the
 
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
health and human services really has the
uh

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
ability to do this right now i would
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
defer to karen
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
as to that um i don't know that we'd be
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
opposed to the department having some
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
portion of this for administrative
 
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.309 align:start position:0%
portion of this for administrative
expenses

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
if necessary but again it is such a
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
small pot of money to
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
start with but again i would defer to
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
karen on that particular point
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
so so thank you oh i'm sorry i didn't
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
mean to cut you off you were done no i
 
00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 align:start position:0%
just said i just said thank you
 
00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
for the information all right if you if
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
you have more you can continue
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
i i do you have more
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
no okay so um
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
in what is the maximum number that would
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
qualify under this paragraph as written
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
are we you know since we're talking
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
about all of the nursing homes in the
 
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
about all of the nursing homes in the
state

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
plus other things that may qualify as
 
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
plus other things that may qualify as
senior

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
senior
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
centers are we talking about 500 to a
 
00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
centers are we talking about 500 to a
thousand

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh potentially i i don't have a firm
 
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.909 align:start position:0%
uh potentially i i don't have a firm
number

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
um but if you assumed that there was one
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
entity in each town
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
right probably 250 is a safe assumption
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's a lot of
 
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
fluctuation there but
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
again the department would have broad
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
discretion on how to operationalize this
 
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.749 align:start position:0%
discretion on how to operationalize this
program

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to do a minimum or a
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
maximum threshold
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
and again if the committee feels that
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
additional details are
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to help set that down a
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
certain track
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have any concerns about
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
well i'm just concerned thank you uh
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
because i'm just
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
thinking that if this gets to
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
well one we have to make sure that it's
 
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.950 align:start position:0%
well one we have to make sure that it's
fair

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
and with 1.5 million dollars that money
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
is going to run out pretty quickly if
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
there are 250 potential bidders
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be spending money
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
on screening and qualifying
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
and approving grants
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
and it just seems to me that we could
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
end up
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
consuming a significant chunk of this
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
money on administrative costs
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
and not getting the money out to help
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
the the centers
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't the more efficient
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
program just be to write a thousand
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
dollar check to everything that can
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
qualify as a senior center and be done
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
if there's an administratively efficient
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
way to deploy this funding
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
again i i think that would definitely be
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
our preference but
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
the language as written in the bill
 
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.629 align:start position:0%
the language as written in the bill
doesn't

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
specify one process or another but we
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
agree that it should be
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
fair and open to any entity that
 
00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.389 align:start position:0%
fair and open to any entity that
qualifies

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
qualifies
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
and we haven't tried to prescribe those
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
those smaller details to the legislation
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i think you would agree we want to
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
minimize administrative costs because
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
we'd rather money get spent actually
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
doing things absolutely
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative i just met i just wanted
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
um i guess i should probably know this
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
myself but i don't
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
so this summer this past summer we've
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
been gopher
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
um set up a number of different funds
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
one of them was a non-profit fund
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
i would assume that most of these senior
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
centers are non-profits
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
do we know how if senior centers took
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of that fund it sounds like
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
it sounds like sort of what what's
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
happening here are
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
um things that um
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
might have been eligible under the go
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
for funding the non-profit gopher
 
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.550 align:start position:0%
for funding the non-profit gopher
funding

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i just wondered if you had any
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
statistics about that
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
nothing offhand what i would say is i
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
would agree most of these entities are
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
either non-profits or municipally owned
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
and these uh uses that we've
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
delineated here would certainly be
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for cares act funding
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
and potentially subsequent federal
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
money that's coming to the state so
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
you are right that there are potentially
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
other pots of money
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
that could accomplish the same purpose
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
but again wanted to do something
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
just showing the state's commitment to
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
again helping seniors get back out
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a great objective i mean
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
particularly since we're dealing with a
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
an age that's particularly vulnerable to
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
the worst aspects of the disease but um
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
but i again i'm just looking for a way
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's fairness and
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
transparency and that we're not spending
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
money on overhead
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh to it too large an extent so
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and and and you're mentioning that
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
we've had had federal money and that we
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
are having new federal money
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
so could you categorically today
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
tell us a definition
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
of senior center and senior citizen
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
centers that
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
just would not qualify for any federal
 
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.350 align:start position:0%
just would not qualify for any federal
money

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
those that are kind of targets of only
 
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.630 align:start position:0%
those that are kind of targets of only
us

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
can help them i i don't know that i have
 
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.870 align:start position:0%
can help them i i don't know that i have
anything

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
that would fit into that category that
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible given that these
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
would be coveted related expenses which
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know one of those key criteria in
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
deploying federal funds
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
and again i think that you know federal
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
funds can go a long way
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know we wanted to to do something
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
that shows again the state's own
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
commitment in hb2 which is why we put
 
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
commitment in hb2 which is why we put
this

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
modest sum of money there um so
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
if the recommendation of the committee
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
is that gophers should run a program or
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
um there are potentially other pots of
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
money but
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
just the rationale for why we saw this
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
do you see modifying the language in a
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
way in which
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
we say that this 1.5 million uh
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
is is is to be funded by
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
you could write that in but i don't know
 
00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:05.519 align:start position:0%
if that's the
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
best way to because it would be such a
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
small portion of what the state would be
 
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.629 align:start position:0%
small portion of what the state would be
receiving

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
it might just be better to allow that to
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
happen on its own as opposed to trying
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
to prescribe
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
such a small portion of that that money
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's coming into the state
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh in such a way representative norgren
 
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh in such a way representative norgren
you

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up but uh i'm gonna
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
go to miss rounds first
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
just in case she has a clarifying
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
as far as administrative uh
 
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.910 align:start position:0%
as far as administrative uh
administratively

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
administratively
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
there really is no way to avoid it
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
administrative work
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
we cannot write a check unless there is
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
a contract that
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
and if it's a contract for more or a
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
grant award
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
if it's more than ten thousand dollars
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
it must go through the governor and
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
council process
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
so so there is no way for the department
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
administrative costs with administering
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
norgren do you have a question
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
no i just want to make a comment that
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
was written months ago before
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
we obviously probably knew of the extent
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the available availability of the
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
gopher money
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
so that might be some part of our
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
consideration that
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
things have changed since this bill was
 
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.750 align:start position:0%
things have changed since this bill was
written

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
so i think we should consider the other
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
options if we can thank you
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
so what would another option be just to
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
to dry out a little bit further
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
well i think i think we need to see if
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
this sort of operation that's in um
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
36 would be covered by cobra before we
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
based on you said 36 i think you mean
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm 37 though right
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
right yes i do i'm reading without my
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
bifuls i'm sorry
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
no problem i'm sorry i cut you off man i
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure we were all
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
talking the same thing
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay no and i appreciate that mr
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i would say based on the the
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
plain language of
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh the american rescue plan that was
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
recently enacted
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
anything that we would have envisioned
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
through this appropriation
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
would be covered by those dollars again
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
i can't point to a
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
unique loophole that we were trying to
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.710 align:start position:0%
unique loophole that we were trying to
solve

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
solve
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
other than again just to reiterate the
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
state's commitment
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh to helping these types of centers
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
that normally don't always have the
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
the money readily available to make
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay miss rounds your hand is up and so
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
is representative nordgren so we'll go
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
to representative nordgren again
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
no nevermind sorry all right
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh do are there any other comments from
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
i you know the way i'm looking at this
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
is i think that it's an important thing
 
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.430 align:start position:0%
is i think that it's an important thing
but

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that it would be a
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
little ineffectual
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that we would eat up too many of
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
these resources
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh not only state resources and hhs
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
but you know there would have to be
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
senior centers all over the state that
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
would have to fill out some kind of form
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
so so they would be incurring expenses
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
too i
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i just um don't see this i see
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
the intent and the
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the good naturedness and the
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
importance of it
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm just not this doesn't
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
strike me as as effectual
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so if if just just
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
spitballing with you and mr malou if we
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
if uh if our committee were to strike
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
37 would would you work with the senate
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
to to kind of tighten up the eligibility
 
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.150 align:start position:0%
to to kind of tighten up the eligibility
and

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
tighten up you know what the process
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
would be to determine who would get it
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
so that they can consider because we
 
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.230 align:start position:0%
so that they can consider because we
can't

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have time it could so that
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
they could consider
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not this was you know a
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
cost-effective and
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
program that delivered what we want mr
 
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:21.990 align:start position:0%
program that delivered what we want mr
chairman

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
we would either do that or work to
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
develop a similar program
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh either through gopher or with federal
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
money so i think
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
one way or another the the spirit and
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of this section
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
um you know we certainly would want to
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
move forward with but
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's working with the senate or
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
just using federal
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh money to to fund some of these
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
similar type initiatives i think to
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
represent a walnut's point
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
um you know there would be other
 
00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:50.230 align:start position:0%
um you know there would be other
pathways

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
pathways
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
and i certainly don't speak for the
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee i was just trying to
 
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
committee i was just trying to
understand

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
the the governor's office reaction if we
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
went down that road so so thank you for
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
that representative norgren i i couldn't
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
tell if you wanted to speak again or not
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
you're welcome well
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
well if there's a time for making the
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
motion i would
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
do that um
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm going to try to act like
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
i've learned something over the last few
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
days and if your motion
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
requires an amendment we're not ready to
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
take a formal amendment
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
but but can you can you tell me a little
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
bit what you think you're going to
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
motion no i i we're just going to make a
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
motion to remove this
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that the theory that the
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
senate will have more information about
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
gopher money
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
and they could put it back in if
 
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.190 align:start position:0%
and they could put it back in if
necessary

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i would love to entertain that
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
motion but i don't think we can because
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have an amendment that
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
strikes this language from hb2 i mean
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
you actually could
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry to interrupt i went ahead
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
and had one drafted just in case you
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
decided to uh go down that road so you
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
actually do have one to vote on this
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
time have you ever watched the tv
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
show mash i'm now going to call you
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
radar ripple
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
he's a mind reader i know i i'll send
 
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.590 align:start position:0%
he's a mind reader i know i i'll send
him

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
a motion that's amazing
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
so so uh representative nordgren if
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
you'd like to make a motion maybe you
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
could reference the amendment that mr
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
ripple has prepared for us
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
here he is oh and it's got my name on it
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
so do you want me to move it on your
 
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.230 align:start position:0%
so do you want me to move it on your
behalf

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
please okay i would like to make a
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
motion to accept the amendment
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
0905 h please
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
back him for a second yes there's a
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
second so
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
um representative bean i assume that
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's not here yet are
 
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.390 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's not here yet are
you

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
you're aware that that says paragraph 19
 
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.870 align:start position:0%
you're aware that that says paragraph 19
correct

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
the paragraph 19 refers to the paragraph
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the analysis
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the bill so it would
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay just just a second big catch good
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
so ms rounds you're you're you're on
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
deck uh
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
because we're we're going to come back
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
to you you know when we're uh
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
okay you ready yes sir
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner yes
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative representative rogers
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
yes irv yes
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative edwards yes
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
i'm representative bean and i'm a yes is
 
00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
i'm representative bean and i'm a yes is
representative

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
sounds like he's not it's uh 6-0 with
 
00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
sounds like he's not it's uh 6-0 with
one

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.710 align:start position:0%
one
absent

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bean so the
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
six to nothing the the motion passes and
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
we will delete section 37.
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
um so ms rounds and the things that you
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
still want to talk about do you still
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
and and matt you're gonna have to like
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
teach me phonetically
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
how to say your name i'm so sorry it's
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
just it's an embarrassment every single
 
00:20:55.919 --> 00:21:00.710 align:start position:0%
just it's an embarrassment every single
time

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
so ms rounds are you ready i am
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
i say i'm ready and then i don't have my
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
crap together to actually share my
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
screen okay here we go
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
so last night
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair you sent me an email um
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
that then was later revised so this is
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
just the revised list
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
of footnotes that you had questions
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
about i assume that's what you wanted to
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
chat about
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
yes those six and then uh representative
 
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
yes those six and then uh representative
earth

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
earth
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
caused the question is your typo
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
great um so we will start with the first
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
one 29.58
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
so there was not a footnote for 2958 in
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
1819 however there was one in 2021
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
to make that non-lapsing within the
 
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
to make that non-lapsing within the
biennium

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we did that was
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
actually a couple of reasons
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
one uh almost all of
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
our or might be
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
all of our like top five accounting
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
units as far as cost
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
are non-lapsing within the biennium
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's medicaid
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's the developmental disabilities
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
accounts the nursing
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
facilities accounts those are all
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing with the within the biennium
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is the other very large service
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
area within the department
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
and so i was looking to treat it the
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
same as we do with the other large
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
service areas in the department
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
the secondary reason which is also a
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
broad reason
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
as to why we would make it non-lapsing
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the biennium
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
we often um
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
see costs increase year over year
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think that's unusual it you
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
know happens
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
everywhere gasoline goes up not the
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
greatest example that one loves to go up
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
and down on a regular basis
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
but you know the cost of a thing of
 
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.430 align:start position:0%
but you know the cost of a thing of
paper

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
goes up you know you know over time so
 
00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.110 align:start position:0%
goes up you know you know over time so
we

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we of course try to budget for that
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
but sometimes costs might be lower in
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
higher lower in the first year higher in
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
at a rate more than what we anticipated
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
so it allows us to
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
carry forward the funds from the first
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
year into the second year
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
to continue to pay for those costs from
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
a lapsing perspective
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
across the biennium math at the end of
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
it all comes out because one
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
either um we would carry those phones
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
forward and continue to pay for it
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
and they would not have lapsed um and
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
then whatever is left at the end of the
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
second tier
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
does lapse um in non-revolving accounts
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
in which this is not a revolving account
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
or it's lapsing it lapses the first year
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
the second year there's not enough funds
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
i have to do a transfer item to transfer
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
it from somewhere else and we lapse less
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
than the second year because
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
that would have otherwise collapsed so
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
over the biennium the net effect
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
should be zero it's really a
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
an ease of accounting if you will to
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
just keep the funds that have been
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated there in the same fund and
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
are there any questions i i have a
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
theory for you
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's it's my own personal
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
theory from
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
having seen government budget officers
 
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.950 align:start position:0%
having seen government budget officers
work

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
and there's a use it or lose it
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
mentality uh
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
towards the end of the fiscal years at
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
least at the federal government level
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
yes where there's a
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
an aggressive push to obligate
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know greater than 99.9 of the money
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
and in doing so it seems that i've
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
witnessed a lot of waste in that process
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
so which method do you think would
 
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.230 align:start position:0%
so which method do you think would
result

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the least waste um having
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
two fiscal year ends that they need to
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
manage towards
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
or to have one big one at the end so are
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
you asking in theory or in what i
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
practice of what i actually demand of my
 
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
practice of what i actually demand of my
staff

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
your staff and your practices that you
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
never waste any money i know that i'm
 
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:22.470 align:start position:0%
never waste any money i know that i'm
just

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say i mean that's an
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
impossibility right like i'm not going
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
to claim that i've never spent a dollar
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't the greatest plan to spend that
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollar that that would be
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
impossible right i'm not perfect my
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
staff are not perfect nobody is
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
um but talk about the theory
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes i can tell you that we do not
 
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
yes i can tell you that we do not
endorse

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
endorse
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
that methodology i have refused
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
things like mass supply orders on june
 
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.269 align:start position:0%
things like mass supply orders on june
15th

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
15th
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
because i don't understand why you need
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
25 boxes of pens for the next three
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
weeks if you really need them
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
why don't we wait till next fiscal year
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
why don't you order just enough to get
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
you through to june 30th
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
because i know what that game is and i
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't play that game either
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
and my staffer are instructed to not
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
approve those types of things and they
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
have pushed back
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
um on that regularly um
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
in practice i mean in theory i'm sorry
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
that was in practice
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
in theory i mean certainly making it
 
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.590 align:start position:0%
in theory i mean certainly making it
non-lapsing

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
just doesn't encourage that behavior
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the first year um it it certainly
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
could still be i guess
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
in theory encouraged in the second year
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
when it does get ready to lapse
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't think if we're
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
talking in theory
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
it just changes the timing of when that
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
happens not necessarily whether it would
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
or wouldn't happen
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
but again i would tell you that i work
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
very hard to not let that happen
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
all right are there any questions
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
so so i think you could talk about the
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
the next one
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
sure so uh this accounting unit 7051
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
is the chip account this accounting unit
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
was new in 2021 so
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
their footnote would not have existed in
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
1819 because the accounting unit did not
 
00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:13.750 align:start position:0%
1819 because the accounting unit did not
exist

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
the funds in this current accounting
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
unit now
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
in 20 and 21 and 20 23
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
would have come from 7948 which is
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
standard medicaid
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
um these are you know all part of the
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
mco contract so we are just treating
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit the same as we are
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
treating 79.48
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not seeing any questions
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
you're on a roll okay the next four
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
um the first two are the path
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
center and the next two are new
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm a little confused that these
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
weren't in 1819 because we thought
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
that these had been in place for for
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
quite some time
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
um so uh maybe it really was just last
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
biennium but we thought it had been
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
longer than that
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm just looking at my notes
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
so 21 is the
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
food costs i believe uh yes so
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
21 is the food cost 23 is
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh utilities if i'm remembering
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.630 align:start position:0%
uh utilities if i'm remembering
correctly

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i would say from a a footnote
 
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
so i would say from a a footnote
perspective

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh to go back to the earlier comment
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
about increasing costs
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
these footnotes are more important in
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
the path center
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
than in new hampshire hospital because
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is will be the first
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 that we're in currently
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
the first year that we've had occupancy
 
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.190 align:start position:0%
the first year that we've had occupancy
24

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
7 in that building so we've had to sort
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
of estimate what the
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
electricity and utility costs might be
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
where that has been
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
a building that has been housing um you
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
know daytime
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
state employees so even fiscal year 21
 
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:09.510 align:start position:0%
state employees so even fiscal year 21
won't

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
won't
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
be an exact science because it wasn't up
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
and running 24 7
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
residence on july 1.
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
so it's more important to carry those
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
forward there at the path center
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing with the food costs is
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire hospital does supply
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
the food
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
to the past center the food costs i
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
believe that contract comes up every
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
three years and i don't remember where
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
in this biennium
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
it ends exactly but there's always a
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
question of what happens with the food
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
cost when those contracts get renewed
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
so that's why we tend to bring those
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
forward in those class times
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
so representative earth you've done the
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
most research in the committee that i
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
know of
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
about looking into these footnotes do
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
you have questions sir or
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
does any committee member have questions
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
i would say as usual karen knows has
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
great explanations
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
i try i keep way too much information in
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
my head that's all i do now
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
um okay the last one
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
um is a little bit confusing and
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
and kevin uh pointed this out as well
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
in an email last night and mary um also
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
this morning when i chatted with her um
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
this footnote this accounting unit isn't
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 2223
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
20 25 59 that's this grant ended so i'm
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
why it shows up on the report so it's a
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
good catch um
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
kevin noted that it probably should be
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
going with the following account 33.80
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that it actually shows in the
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
pdf of the total budget on 33.80 is that
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
so that should not be there
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
so my question is what is this is this a
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
simple administrative fix for you guys
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
do you need a
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
vote from the division three or
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
something else kevin i don't i don't
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
think we need any kind of vote right
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's on 3380 where it's supposed to be
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
so it should be fine
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
yeah the budget is actually fine it's
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
just the report that we uh
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
printed out from the budget system
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
assigned the footnote to the wrong
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
accounting unit for some reason so you
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
do we need a vote on the six
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
footnotes probably not unless
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
somebody is opposed to them right
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's not no vote i mean
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
unless somebody opposes these
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
if you're going to keep them i don't
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
think there's any need for a vote
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to delete any of those
 
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to delete any of those
footnotes

i'm not seeing anyone wanting to delete
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
let's cross put node acceptance off our
 
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.070 align:start position:0%
let's cross put node acceptance off our

list
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
did you want to talk about enhanced fmap
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
that's a nice topic or is that
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else uh kevin can lead the
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
discussion and i'm happy to answer any
 
00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:22.310 align:start position:0%
discussion and i'm happy to answer any
questions

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
well we want to make sure we've heard
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
everything that you've prepared to tell
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
us today are there any of these sections
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
that you brought some notes in you that
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
we should be talking about the hb2
 
00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:32.710 align:start position:0%
we should be talking about the hb2
sections

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
um i don't think so and i think uh
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
looking at the agenda the the tanf
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
amendment if that doesn't come until the
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
end when mary is here mary
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
is probably even more um familiar with
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
tanf than i am so
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh i actually not probably is she
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
most definitely is so there's no reason
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
that she can't speak to that one
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
without me so representative walner if
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
if you're ready uh why don't we we go to
 
00:33:00.159 --> 00:33:00.630 align:start position:0%
if you're ready uh why don't we we go to
you

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
and bring mary in and that way mary and
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
or i don't want to put you i don't want
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
to put you on the spot
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
are you ready no we're we're ready i
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
think kevin do you want to can you put
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
up the new
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a second would you try to
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
get a status on uh
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative weiler could can you
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
turn around i will yes sir
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay um are you ready
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
yes okay so i think if you look online
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
you think it was line four i think it
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
said to
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
fully fund employment related child care
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's correct right and then
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
um let me see down towards the
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
bottom uh right here
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner he or she shall
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
in to the extent allowed under
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
federal regulation utilize federal um
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
available federal tana funds now that la
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
that wording was added the wording to
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
the extent
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
allowable to put um to put some
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
um you know parameters around
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
how much could be used
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
from uh from that fund
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
so that i think that was the
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
instructions we got
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
well i was the only one who was um
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
commenting on this because i i think
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and maybe representative erf both uh
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that this is a a good
 
00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that this is a a good
amendment

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i just was concerned about the
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning i mean
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
just in general i i like to leave this
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
management discretion in the hands of
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
the leadership of our departments
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
and and not be too directive with them
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
just because if we expect them to make
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
tough decisions we ought to be able to
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
ask them to make routine decisions you
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
know but
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm i'm i'm thankful to you for
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
considering different language and i'm
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sufficiently satisfied with what
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
you've done and
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
very grateful for your work
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
i i would want to entertain emotion
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
but unlike the previous vote i i think
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
this might be one that representative
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
weiler might have
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
more interested in uh although
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
and we would love to have his support
 
00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:26.550 align:start position:0%
and we would love to have his support
okay

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
um do you have any uh
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
so miss rounds and and mary they don't
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have any questions does anyone
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
have any questions for
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
all right um let's let's uh sort of
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
um informally just table this to see if
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
we can come back when representative
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
weiler is ready
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
and then we'll call a vote on it if if
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's okay we'll ask for a motion
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
um what did you learn representative
 
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.630 align:start position:0%
um what did you learn representative
bean

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
bean
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
i learned that uh representative weiler
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be with uh representative
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
majors at two o'clock
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
to get info from ways and means and he's
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
he's gonna try to get back with us but
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
he's not sure
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay so uh because this is the last day
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we have work to do so let's i i'd
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
i've made the motion about i assume
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
amendment zero nine one
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay so uh is there any discussion
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any uh so uh mr clerk are
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
you ready to call a role
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%

passes and we've accepted this and i
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%

way into hp2 with the proper section
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
you you think we're going to want to
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
talk to you about
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
um we can talk about the enhanced fmap
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh like i said kevin
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
kevin can lead the discussion and i'll
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
i should say thank you representative
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
walner for identifying that and working
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
through all the details
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
so as you heard previously an enhanced
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
federal fmap
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
was budgeted for certain medicaid
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
accounting units
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
mainly the managed care accounting unit
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
but it was not
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
included in other accounting units so
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
for example the developmental
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities accounts the children's
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
health insurance program
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
did not assume the same enhanced fmap in
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
the first six months
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
of fiscal 22 as some of the other
 
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.109 align:start position:0%
of fiscal 22 as some of the other
accounts

00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
so the department has submitted and i'll
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
scroll down here
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
a list of change sheets
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
swapping out general funds for federal
 
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:00.870 align:start position:0%
swapping out general funds for federal
funds

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of continuing to receive
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
that enhanced fmap
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
and there are a total of five accounts
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
here four within developmental services
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
and one is the children's health
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we can post these all on our website
 
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.470 align:start position:0%
and we can post these all on our website
too

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
but up at the top here we have a summary
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
of the changes
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
and the net result of this change would
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
be you would pick up 12.1 million in
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 and federal funds would
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
increase by approximately the same
 
00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.230 align:start position:0%
increase by approximately the same
amount

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
which technically speaking would happen
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the real
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
world anyways this is just getting our
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
budget more in line with the reality
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
we're expecting
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's correct this is you're
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
saving general funds for budget
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
for budget purposes only here they would
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
so do you have anything to add to that
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
mr rounds
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
i do not other than can i pick the
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
things that keep funded
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
can i trade off what you what you might
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
consider be cutting
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
to uh business so let me make sure i
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand your question
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh because it's i think there's a real
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a real question there
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
but um so we're adding to the revenue
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're actually keeping the revenue lines
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
so that should in theory not impact
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
any of those expenses associated with
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
that accounting code right correct it
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any of the class lines it
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
just changes the revenue source
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
so so restate your question so that i
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
understand what you're
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
what you're asking or if it's a joke
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
that i get to joe
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely i mean it's a joke
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
it is a question in a way but how about
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
i say it as a statement
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
i i do hope that by um you know
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
providing the information on this
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars that it will reduce
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
it will result in less reductions to the
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
department's budget
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
i understand the request and the
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
rationale for it
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
um it's from your position it's an
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
entirely reasonable request um
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple what what is the
 
00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.430 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple what what is the
appropriate

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
procedural work here for us to
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
bring these worksheets into into uh our
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
proposed hb1 amendment
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
well there's no amendment number here
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
since it didn't come out of ols it came
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
from us
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
but if you were so inclined you could
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
just vote to accept the changes
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
the proposed changes on these budget
 
00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.069 align:start position:0%
the proposed changes on these budget
pages

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
is that a relevant vote do you need that
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh we can do it yes i i i would suggest
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
making that vote because you are after
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
all making a change
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
to house bill one as introduced
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
were there um any just conversation
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
about this still
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
like uh any any of the committee members
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
want to ask
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
ms ron some questions mr ripple
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf yes i always
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
obviously fully support this i'm just
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
wondering karen
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
in our working with this what's the best
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
work with it in terms of our budget do
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
we just accept
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
we just assume the general funds are 12
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
point whatever lower and that'll just
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
work out in the wash when it gets to the
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
senate kind of a thing
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah kevin will actually make the
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
changes in the budget
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
itself and so it'll be represented in
 
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.150 align:start position:0%
itself and so it'll be represented in
hb1

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so the way we work like we can just
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
basically treat it as a
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in general funds and kevin
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
will compensate for all that when he
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
does the real work
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
correct thank you and we're actually
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to vote
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
on what mr ripple puts together based on
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
some of this input
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
i understand there's a we're going to
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
vote on an hb1
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and and by if we vote on this
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
this will be reflected in
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
in mr ripple's work and we'll be voting
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
right is that well i think this would be
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
the final vote that division
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
three would take on these items uh it'll
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it'll certainly be included in the
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
packet that's presented to
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
the full committee when that exact
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
session is held and the full committee
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
would vote on these changes
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
so um i i i think we could entertain a
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh accept these enhanced fmap budget
 
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
uh accept these enhanced fmap budget
changes

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
i would make that motion to accept the
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
summary of enhanced fmap budget changes
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
into our general fund budgeting process
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay so before that gets seconded a
 
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.910 align:start position:0%
okay so before that gets seconded a
second

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
oh you just seconded it i saw your hand
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
go up okay
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
all right so it's been moved and
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
seconded is there any discussion on the
 
00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.910 align:start position:0%
seconded is there any discussion on the
motion

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%

over lunch to show
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
our status on hb2 yeah
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
did you share that next is there a
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's just chunk through
 
00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:57.990 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's just chunk through
this

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
um in sequence um i think we've
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
we've hit around them uh it says here
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative earth
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
you have a proposal on a recommendation
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
for section 24.
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yes amendment to the county
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement fund is that what you're
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
yes if you're ready to speak to that
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah let me um
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay i was trying to put yeah fine let
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
me just go bring it up so i can read it
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
so i know what i'm talking about so so
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to this document again
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
mr ripple but we'll take a dive into 24
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay um i wait for mr ripple to bring
 
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.910 align:start position:0%
okay um i wait for mr ripple to bring
the

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure how much of the budget
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
is incorporated in that
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
mr ripple can i just speak to the budget
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
the analysis that might be what i'm
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
doing in the budget and then we can
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
tie it into this okay sure um yes
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
okay so if you want i can bring up that
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
house bill one amendment that's related
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't put it on okay
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.839 --> 00:48:15.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll speak to this first and
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
then this will tie back into
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are in hb2
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
so this is the county cap
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
part of the budget and i'll come back to
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
this but basically we're proposing to
 
00:48:33.119 --> 00:48:34.790 align:start position:0%
this but basically we're proposing to
raise

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
the cap but before i get to that
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
something else that happens and perhaps
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
mr rip you could highlight the
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
under fy um 22 the 211 000 540 well the
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
10 000. that's fine sure that's a
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah so part of the
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
amended budget includes
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
reducing the budgeted item for line 504
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
in each of the two coming years 22 and
 
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.069 align:start position:0%
in each of the two coming years 22 and
23

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
23
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
based on and i believe all of this has
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
this count this discussion's been in
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
conjunction with
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
the department is the county is talking
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the notion is that the counties have
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
estimated that bed
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
use rate i guess at 3 900 versus i
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
believe 4 100 or maybe 4 000 was the
 
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:29.910 align:start position:0%
believe 4 100 or maybe 4 000 was the
number

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
used in preparing the initial budget
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
with the 221 million dollar
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
number in there so this reduces that
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
line by 10 million dollars in
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
22 to roughly 211 million dollars
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
and then essentially increases it from
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
there but decreases it from the
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
originally budgeted amount by five
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars to 216 million dollars
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
so making that change has an impact
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the county cap as well because it's a
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
lower total expense if you drop down to
 
00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
lower total expense if you drop down to
um

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
i guess it doesn't get there you go
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
so so that has gone that has dropped
 
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
so so that has gone that has dropped
down

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay so now down to what the in addition
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
to that change
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying change is as follows so
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
is obliged to maybe it's the wrong word
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
but in any case
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
my word is bad just correct me to
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
allocate from the general fund five
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
against the costs
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
above which include the nursing home
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
payments that's obviously the primary
 
00:50:41.119 --> 00:50:41.589 align:start position:0%
payments that's obviously the primary
one

00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
but it also includes the other three
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
lines 505 506
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
529 which are related but
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
less less costly um and what the
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
proposal is
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
is to well let me go back traditionally
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
the county cap
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
has gone up roughly from i understand
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
historically two to three percent
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
per year naturally last biennium and
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
maybe even the one before that it
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
started to change dramatically
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i recall that we on division three
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
put in uh budgeted basically an
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
increase to the county cap i don't have
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
that number right in front of me but
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we did and the idea
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
this by aim is to do something similar
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
and to build in
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
a two percent cap per year
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
increase and the the net effect of that
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
is what are the numbers um
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
is that the 14 million 550 it's just i'm
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
sorry kevin it's a different way that
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it is it the 14 million
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
550 is that the
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
general fund increase and effort there
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
we go that's correct yes
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that increases the general fund in fy
 
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
so that increases the general fund in fy
22

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
by the 14 and a half million and in 23
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
so that is the budget
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to the hb2
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
should we take questions on this
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely of course
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that everyone's
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
absorb what you just said and make sure
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
they understand it
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to throw some numbers
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
at you that i remember
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
from uh one of the briefings and that
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.230 align:start position:0%
from uh one of the briefings and that
was

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the county said that they had been
 
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
that the county said that they had been
asked

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
to budget at 4 100 nursing home beds
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
and they thought that was too high and
 
00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
and they thought that was too high and
therefore

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
their expense line was higher than it
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
should be because of that
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
that estimation of nursing home beds
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and that they advocated that that number
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
instead be
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
3 700. and i'm seeing 3 900 there and so
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
i just am testing my memory
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
did that want to be 3 900 or was that
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be 3 700 in the footnote
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
well when i looked it up in my uh email
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
this morning from our
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
county nursing home administrator who's
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
been pretty involved with this
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
he gave me the 3 900 number and he gave
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
him the other number as well but i don't
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
have fun of me but i did send it to
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
kevin did i say 4 000 cabinet or 4 100.
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
4 100 originally down to 3 900. okay so
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
those are the numbers that came from my
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
county administrator that's all i can
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
speak to mr trump no no that's great i
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
just am just double checking my memory
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the 3700
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
estimate so so the 504
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
decrease of 10 million dollars is the
 
00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:43.829 align:start position:0%
decrease of 10 million dollars is the
result

00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
of reducing the estimated nursing home
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
beds by 200.
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
correct for next year for 22.
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
and since it looks like we're carrying
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
that into the second year of the budget
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're expecting that 3 900 nursing home
 
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
we're expecting that 3 900 nursing home
beds

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
beds
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
to still be a good estimate well we're
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
expecting it to
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're expecting the bed counts to go up
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
because we're only reducing by five
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
million in the second
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
does the footnote need to to say that
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're using a different
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
um well you you don't really need a
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
footnote at all
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh but similar footnotes have been in
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
previous budgets if you wanted to
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
include this you could say the
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation in class 504 reflects
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
an initial okay an initial caseload
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
assumption of 3 900 beds or you could
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
simply say
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
an assumption of 3 900 beds in fiscal
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
year 22
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
and be silent on 23.
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
okay so to me a footnote helps the
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
reader of the spreadsheet understands
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
under to understand key assumptions and
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
this feels like a key assumption to me
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
so i i'd be tempted to include that in a
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
footnote but
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
um but i've never been an accountant so
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
um i is there a reason if there's no
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
reason to not
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
include the extra detail for the second
 
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.789 align:start position:0%
include the extra detail for the second
year

00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
i i i think i'd like to see it done just
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
the senate knows what they're looking at
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
i don't actually have detail of the
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
number of beds i think it's built on the
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
fact that they're expecting the bed con
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
to start to go up again
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
as the covid uh pandemic
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
wanes yes sir that's why i was thinking
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
that we were using a different bed count
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm just trying to see if others
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
think that we ought to be explicit about
 
00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:44.230 align:start position:0%
think that we ought to be explicit about
what

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
estimate we're using in the second year
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not hearing
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of yes that we should be explicit
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
from a department accounting perspective
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change anything for us if
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough funds in there or
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
the bed count ends up higher and so the
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
costs are higher and there's not enough
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
funds we have to transfer funds from
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the department so
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really change anything from
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
our perspective
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner your hand is
 
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.109 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner your hand is
up

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
well just i mean i'm reading the
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
footnote and i
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
i guess if i were just reading it i
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
would assume we were using 3 900
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
so if nothing else we should stipulate
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
that that estimate's
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
is that your point representative no i
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
just i'm just saying that when i read it
 
00:56:40.319 --> 00:56:40.789 align:start position:0%
just i'm just saying that when i read it
i

00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
i just assumed when i read it initially
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
i just assumed it was for both years
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't you know so i guess you could
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
make you could make it more you can
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
make it more detailed and just say for
 
00:56:56.839 --> 00:56:58.870 align:start position:0%
make it more detailed and just say for
22.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
so i think i'd rather delete it or make
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
it more precise
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know right now it's ambiguous and
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
do you have a recommendation for for
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
that mr ripple
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
i think you could vote on this uh if you
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
were inclined to vote on it today
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
with that change um and that's the
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
version that we would
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
put into the budget and i'm actually
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find this in excel right now
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
so i can just change it right now and
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
you can vote on that
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
actual language okay
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps you're gonna say full case load
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
or fy22 either initial caseload
 
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.309 align:start position:0%
or fy22 either initial caseload
assumption

00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
or in fy22 let me just try to find this
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
in excel while you're doing that
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
i i want to tee up the other part of
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet conversation which is
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we we would be making a decision here
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
to to change fy 22
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
to add 14.5 million of general funds
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
to the this this line to this account
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a that's a big
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
decision and
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
it would be good to get uh feedback on
 
00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
it would be good to get uh feedback on
that

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
from the committee can i make a comment
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
would that be okay yes just so the
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
committee understands regarding the way
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
since i was starting with the fy21
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
adjusted base that has built into it
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
the county cap figures from the current
 
00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:52.710 align:start position:0%
the county cap figures from the current
biennium

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
so in fact in terms of our thinking
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
about what we're adding in in general
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of what i shouldn't say we what
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of what we're adding into
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
what i viewed as the general fund base
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
that was in those documents that you all
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
that one page document i
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
we went through a while back that the
 
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:09.990 align:start position:0%
we went through a while back that the
net

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
net
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
impact is about two million dollars
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
slightly over two million dollars per
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
year so all total it's about a four and
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
a half million dollar general fund
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
increase over those numbers that i
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
any questions about the general funds
 
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
any questions about the general funds
line

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
no i'm not seeing any is is the third
 
00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:55.670 align:start position:0%
no i'm not seeing any is is the third
thing

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
on this representative earth
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
something about the sequence of
 
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.710 align:start position:0%
something about the sequence of
allocating

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
allocating
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
funds that's all in the
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 amendment that i was we can go back
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
to if you want to i can go through that
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
this is just the numbers for 22 and 23.
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
so so mr ripple i see that you've
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
changed line 30 or whatever that is to
 
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:22.549 align:start position:0%
changed line 30 or whatever that is to
include

01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
more precision on the note thank
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
is can we see the whole section 24 in
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
this view
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
or or do you need to go one smaller oh
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
this is really long ages that's all
 
01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
this is really long ages that's all
right

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
then it's too long to try to get into
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
one view sorry
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
well there are there has to be parts and
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that and he can move
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
as we go
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i'll start with i think i think i'll
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
be speaking about the top part for us a
 
01:01:26.319 --> 01:01:28.950 align:start position:0%
be speaking about the top part for us a
second

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i speak about them the
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
wrong order kevin
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
but there are basically three parts to
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
this one of which
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
is a replacement for the current hb2
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
part we'll come to that that's the
 
01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.789 align:start position:0%
part we'll come to that that's the
numbers

01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
the other two are as follows and if i
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
left one if i if i'm
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
not including something i'm sure karen
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
will remind me so right now
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
the funds as budgeted there are three
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh streams so to speak there's the
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
initial five
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars from i shouldn't say the
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
this is the ordering but these are the
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
the the streams the five million dollars
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
that the state is obliged
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's the county cap and there's the
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
additional general funds that we're
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
asking the county to
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
include i mean the state excuse me to
 
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.870 align:start position:0%
include i mean the state excuse me to
include

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is it has currently
 
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.470 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is it has currently
implemented

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
the funds the the
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh i believe the five million i'm sorry
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah the five million dollars
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
is the first money spent toward the
 
01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.870 align:start position:0%
is the first money spent toward the
total

01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
total
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund increases the second
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
stream applied spent toward that total
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
the budget total and the county cap
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
is the last stream applied
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
now the effect of that can be if they're
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
if it goes over then essentially
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
oh how did i say that i think i said
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that backwards
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
i believe the other way around the
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
counties go first
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
then the general fund excess then the
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
five million dollars
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
so the counties basically get drained
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
and then you hit the general
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
and then you hit the five the general
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
increasing into five million dollars
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
which means that if you go over the
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
budget essentially the counties have
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
already paid everything in
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the state essentially didn't pay in
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
the last bit and my understanding and
 
01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.750 align:start position:0%
the last bit and my understanding and
again

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong but in some sense this
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
is related to
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
discussions about enhanced fmap which
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
are to be honest a little bit
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of actual numbers beyond what i
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
could fully grok
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
um but but instead of trying to as as i
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to account for the
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
in these lines and how they relate to
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
whether the county should be in
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
part of that or not the agreement was
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
just to switch it around so that the all
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
the general funds are applied first
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
expended first and then the county funds
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
so they so
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they go over the
 
01:04:06.319 --> 01:04:07.430 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they go over the
budgeted

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
amount the counties are not spending
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
that last those last dollars
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that in some sense that balances
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
things out and karen i just
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
if if if i'm totally wet there please um
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
so yes this section does
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
if there is an enhanced fmap which right
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
now there is
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating that there will be
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
for the first two quarters of fiscal
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
year 22
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
so this statute change presumably would
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
affect those two quarters
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
the enhanced fmap would get paid out
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
or or would i shouldn't say that the
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap would still get paid out
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
to the providers
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
however the amount that the providers
 
01:04:48.559 --> 01:04:49.430 align:start position:0%
however the amount that the providers
receive

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
would not change because of the enhanced
 
01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.549 align:start position:0%
would not change because of the enhanced
fmap

01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
fmap
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
the offset to county funds would then
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
result in county funds going back to the
 
01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:00.630 align:start position:0%
result in county funds going back to the
county

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
um kevin
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
can you also bring over henry lipman he
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
just sent me a message he's been
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
listening and
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
um has some additional input that i
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
what i would say is just from a policy
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
perspective do you understand that
 
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
perspective do you understand that
currently

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
the additional funds that result from
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
the enhanced fmap get paid out to
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
every nursing facility in the state um
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
and this would change that that
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
that the additional funds as the result
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the enhanced fmap would go back to
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
the 10 counties
 
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
and henry you said you had an additional
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
comment there
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to make sure i heard
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative erf correctly again for
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
the record this is henry lipman the
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
medicaid director
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of how the county
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
cap funds flow to pay the expenses
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
the the five million credit is taken up
 
01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
the the five million credit is taken up
front

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
then typically because the cash flow
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
is 40 uh counties pay their county cap
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
amount 45 days
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
in arrears there's general funds use so
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
typically what's ending up happening is
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the five million dollar credit
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
and the last session was a little over
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
those funds are moving first um
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
i think the issue that that karen just
 
01:06:25.119 --> 01:06:25.910 align:start position:0%
i think the issue that that karen just
highlighted

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
highlighted
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
is that under current statute the
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
the enhanced fmap that ends up in the
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
nursing facility line 504
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
by statute ends up being distributed to
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
all providers as opposed to being a
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
credit to the
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
the cap and i think that's what this
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
language is attempting to
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
address when there's an enhanced fmap
 
01:06:47.599 --> 01:06:49.829 align:start position:0%
address when there's an enhanced fmap
situation

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
and i think similar to your earlier
 
01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:53.910 align:start position:0%
and i think similar to your earlier
discussions

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
this afternoon on something i think you
 
01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.270 align:start position:0%
this afternoon on something i think you
deferred

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
deferred
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
vote later there there are times and for
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
example in the american
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
rescue act plan that was just approved
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
by the president there are conditions on
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
the home and community based service
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap that just got passed that
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
says it has to be spent on
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
should i continue i'm sorry go ahead no
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you keep going
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's the floor is yours
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir so you want to scroll up
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
so this next piece with the numbers in
 
01:07:49.359 --> 01:07:49.670 align:start position:0%
so this next piece with the numbers in
it

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
is basically what's in the current
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
budget except with the numbers i mean
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the current hb2 number
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
24 except the numbers have been modified
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
to correspond to the increase
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
that i described you when we're looking
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
at the budget with the two percent
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
increase in the cap in 22 and another
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
two percent increase
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
in 23 and then if you continue scrolling
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
up well actually i don't have to it's
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
so the third part of this sets
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
that two percent increase going forward
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
um so that in the next biennium the and
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
these can all be changed by the
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
legislature but this would set it such
 
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.510 align:start position:0%
legislature but this would set it such
that

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
when the state when the department
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
um does in their initial budgeting they
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
would essentially be including
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
the county these adjustments to the
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
county cap that have been going on over
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the years
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
in their initial budgeting as as opposed
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
to simply having in the
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
5 million dollars so i think that covers
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
all three of the
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
could i just mention something on that
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
of course um
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that it's
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
understood that the consequence of that
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
is that there's commitment of additional
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
general funds so if there's a
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of beds or an
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
increase in the cost of nursing
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
facilities or cfi
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
um at a rate greater than two percent it
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
means that
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
there will be potentially significant
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
additional general funds appropriated
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
mass can i ask you a question yes
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming in that case that the top
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
line would be going up the the
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
the budget line the correct 504 line
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
correct but if we can only increase the
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
county contribution by two percent
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the rest would have to be made up with
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the way that's what it is
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
now correct and that's what we're
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i mean the expectation is
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm sorry but go ahead pretend no i
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
just was gonna
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
address what i think ms round's point is
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
um the the lower we fixed
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
that percentage like it's been three
 
01:10:11.199 --> 01:10:12.229 align:start position:0%
that percentage like it's been three
percent

01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know the last few years if we made
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
it two percent it essentially
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
exposes the state to more inflation
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
risk than they have now and
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
and and and so if there's a reason why
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
i would say it it may be because
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
um the county when they go to get money
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're going
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
to one source and that's property taxes
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
and we have an enormous issue with
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
being escalated uh
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't want it to get escalated to
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
the point of exceeding
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
fixed income earners cost of living
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
adjustments and the like and so
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
so i think i think trying to
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
set a course at a two percent level
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
instead of a three percent level
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
is is is just meant to reflect
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
that if the state needs to find more
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
money it needs to find it somewhere
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
other than property taxes i think that's
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
what that's saying
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
and and and i know you don't necessarily
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
agree because you're just making a point
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to give you what i
 
01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.030 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to give you what i
think

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
the full side of that of your point is
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes and i don't have an opinion
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
either way it's a policy decision to be
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
made by the legislature i just wanted to
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
that was understood yes so
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
committee there's a lot of information
 
01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
committee there's a lot of information
here

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative wallner do you have a
 
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
representative wallner do you have a
question

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
no no thank you
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
so when we looked at the spreadsheet can
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
we go back to oh there's more
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh words here is there more stuff on
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 we should be talking about because
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's more bold letters
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
like why line 20 did we talk about line
 
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.590 align:start position:0%
like why line 20 did we talk about line
20

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
do we need to talk about line 20 it is
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
bold it's
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a change
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that's that i didn't happen it
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
was the wrong place in the
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendment representative talked about
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
this earlier
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's the allocation order that's part
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
of that yes
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
sorry no that's all right uh
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
can if are we at the bottom of this
 
01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
can if are we at the bottom of this
amendment

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay i have absolutely no sense what the
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee is thinking about
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
this does anyone want to volunteer
 
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
this does anyone want to volunteer
thoughts

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to volunteer thoughts so
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think we have to wait for
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative weiler to come back on
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
before we um have any motions
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
um all right could we go back to your
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
sheet uh that you were showing us we we
 
01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:17.669 align:start position:0%
sheet uh that you were showing us we we
just

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
saw section 24 and we took a diversion
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
and you're getting close to having to
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
leave uh ms rounds
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
what do you i just want to ask you again
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
because we value your input that if
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
there's something that you think you're
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to or may need to
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
relative to any of these sections that
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't closed out
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
gray represents closed out um so i would
 
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
gray represents closed out um so i would
say

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
26 and 33 are
 
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:55.750 align:start position:0%
26 and 33 are
probably

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
two that i would like to participate in
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
if you plan to talk about them today
 
01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
if you plan to talk about them today
yeah

01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think i actually would like to vote on
 
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.830 align:start position:0%
i think i actually would like to vote on
26.

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
26.
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
so so let's um i'm going to make a note
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we're skipping 24
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
and too so we can get to 26.
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
26 there
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion on it the
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
other day
 
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
um and as i recall the governor
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
had uh or the off the governor's office
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
terminate the flexibility january 1
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
of 2023 which is just
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
was interesting because it wasn't the
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so um if we agreed with the governor
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do anything
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
we would just leave that and i don't
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
think we have an amendment prepared to
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
do anything to section 26
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
anyways are mr ripple are you aware of
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
for section 26 i am not
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
so i i guess that means if nobody's
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
trying to change it then we don't have
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
to even vote as a committee because
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're just rolling with what's in hp2 is
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
that a proper
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
you you have been taking votes to keep
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
sections in
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh so in order to be consistent i think
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
he would vote on this one too
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative i'm i'm just going
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
to say that i
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
i would vote no
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
on this on this section i feel it's much
 
01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
on this on this section i feel it's much
more

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to go to the end of the
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
biennium um it's just
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
a small thing it's just a little
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
different of opinion but
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
um i didn't prepare an amendment
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay so um i i genuinely appreciate that
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
feedback because i'll i'll defer a vote
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
um did did you have a comment ms rounds
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
i mean you you decided this may be one
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
where you had something for us
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
no i i just want to make sure to be
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
available for questions i i think i
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
testified to how important i think this
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
to keep for the biennium and um
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
i know the the governor's office has you
 
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.470 align:start position:0%
i know the the governor's office has you
know

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
a different belief and that's
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
understandable but i
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
i feel really strongly about it being
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
all right you've raised your hand
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes i've been comfortable with changing
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
it as well i mean putting it back the
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
way it was
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
changing it from what it is now i guess
 
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.870 align:start position:0%
changing it from what it is now i guess
um

01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
it helped make sure i'm sorry what it is
 
01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
it helped make sure i'm sorry what it is
now

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
is it needs to be amended because right
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
left it alone it would have expired in
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so that we basically have
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
two decisions one do nothing and it
 
01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
becomes january 1 2023
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
where we ask for an amendment to change
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
it to june 30 2023
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
do you have a preference on which of
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
those two things we do
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd be inclined to ask kevin to
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
make such an amendment
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
to change into january i'm sorry
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
10 30 at the end so change it back to
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
june right okay change it back to what's
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the brackets june 30 20 21 thank you
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
june june 30 2023 okay
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
sorry yes correct i'm sorry
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a little tired we have a machine we
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
got to go we got to keep going forward
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
no i apologize all right if we have a
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
time machine i'm going pre-covered
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
just for the record i think when i'm
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
going back i'm going post code
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
yeah post comment that's better i'm
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to age
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
23 myself i don't know where you guys
 
01:18:14.719 --> 01:18:17.030 align:start position:0%
23 myself i don't know where you guys
are

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay so um so you've got that you're
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
all drafted so we'll skip further
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on that can you go
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
and this was the one you voted on some
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
tentative language the other day and i
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
said i needed to put that into a
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
formal amendment from ols and i have
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
that so i can just pull that up
 
01:18:52.840 --> 01:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
that so i can just pull that up
momentarily

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:32.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay ms rounds would you just remind me
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
what we were thinking when we
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
asked you to come up with different
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
language and i know mr ripple
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
got this done for us but i think you you
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
you crafted the language initially i did
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
and um what we were thinking is that
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
the original language was added by the
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office i did not have
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to discuss it with them
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
before they put it in hv2
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
and so when the document became public i
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
shared my concerns with the governor's
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
office which
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
they um immediately understood and
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
realized that there were some unintended
 
01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
realized that there were some unintended
consequences

01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
and as such um were comfortable with me
 
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
and as such um were comfortable with me
drafting

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
language uh to meet
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
the same goal which is some transparency
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
around when
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
we accept federal dollars that may
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
supplant a general fund dollar
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
um but not to put a restriction that may
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any questions i i think i
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
think we could take um
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
a motion on this should i make a motion
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment number zero nine zero
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
your hp two
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.669 --> 01:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
is there a second i i can't tell
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
representative if you want to make a
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
ma'am

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
can you unmute her rook mr ross i'm just
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
i was trying to enlarge it so i could
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
read it i said uh
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
if if if you're not ready for us to vote
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
on it it hasn't been seconded yet we can
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
could could karen speak to it again i'm
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i was a little distracted and then
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
i couldn't read it so
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
of course so the original language the
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
had put in hb2 uh said that and
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the original language i
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
have the original language
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
in front of me okay
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
so the that language said any time that
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh accepted a federal fund either
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
because of a change in allocation or
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
what they call the miscalculation
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
or due to a new uh program that any
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
general fund it supplanted
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be lapsed um which the
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
the most um sort of forefront example i
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
can give you is the enhanced fmap with
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
standard medicaid
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have had enough money in the
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid account uh to pay for current
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
caseloads if that had happened
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
so we would have been forced to lapse
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
money in the out of that account
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then had to either fund find funds
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the department
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
or come back to the legislature and say
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
we need money even though we're lapsing
 
01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
we need money even though we're lapsing
these

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
this other money so um and then when it
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
comes to cost allocation sort of a
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
secondary example
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're are times when a salary
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
like mine might include one fund source
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's a hundred dollars of general
 
01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
that's a hundred dollars of general
funds

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the allocation might change that
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
might offset that general fund and then
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
but i might need that general fund in
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
someone else's salary because their
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
allocation changed in the opposite
 
01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:37.189 align:start position:0%
allocation changed in the opposite
direction

01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't be able to transfer that
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
we'd have to lapse the dollar and then
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
find another one
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
um so the governor's office realized
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh that that was going to put some undue
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
burden on the department and so
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
they wanted still some transparency
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
around when that does happen
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this language is that
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
when we go to fiscal committee with a
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
transfer item with an accept and expend
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
that we will report on when that might
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
be happening
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
and then what the plan is for that
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
general fund dollar have i transferred
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
it for another purpose
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
am i using it for another purpose or
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
will it actually lapse which in
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
many cases that does happen for example
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
additional 4e earn earlier today when we
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
earn those extra federal dollars
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood we're going to lapse
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
that so so there are times that that
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
does happen
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
but the language was was written in such
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
a way that it was not going to work
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
so we thought here was reasonable the
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office agreed
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
um is that helpful
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay we have a a motion and a second
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
to adopt amendment 2021-0908
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
there being no discussion uh
 
01:25:03.110 --> 01:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative bean can you take a role
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair representative walner
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative noah edwin
 
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.790 align:start position:0%
yes representative noah edwin
yes

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative earth yes
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative edwards yes
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm representative bean i'm a yes
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
is still absent so it's 6-0
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
so uh so i guess i guess we just about
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
hit your
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
your end time 226 um
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
do you uh miss rounds uh so thank you

and is mary on the panel so that we can
 
01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:52.229 align:start position:0%
and is mary on the panel so that we can
continue

01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
random conversations yes chairman i'm
 
01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.430 align:start position:0%
random conversations yes chairman i'm
here

01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right all right um let's go back
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the sheet on hb2s
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
this is the language regarding
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal of eligibility for
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
access to the state's mental health
 
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:22.310 align:start position:0%
access to the state's mental health
system

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
so i think there was i can pull up that
 
01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.790 align:start position:0%
so i think there was i can pull up that
section

01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
although the section itself
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
isn't very instructive um
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
yes we had we had some dialogue with
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
the public on this mr skibby had some
 
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
the public on this mr skibby had some
suggestions

01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
um i balanced them off of the policy
 
01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
um i balanced them off of the policy
committee

01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
the policy committee initially said that
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
that everything was okay because this
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
was going to be a moot point
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
any moment because there's already been
 
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.510 align:start position:0%
any moment because there's already been
language

01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
adopted that is to go into effect
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh and so this was going to be a moot
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
issue and i was expecting to be able to
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
come in here
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
and say we can either leave it or or
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
delete it because it's going to be
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
irrelevant here
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
pretty soon but then there was some
 
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.669 align:start position:0%
pretty soon but then there was some
follow-up

01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
emails on it and and the policy
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
committee came and said ah
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
maybe there is a reason to amend this
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
so um i did not ask for an amendment to
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
be crafted
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't think uh mr ripple that that
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
based on that email exchange you
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
probably uh didn't
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
have uh any cause to do
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment i didn't draft an amendment
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
based on that email exchange
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
um i did draft two standby amendments
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
just in case
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
in case you decided to either take it
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
out or in case you decided to accept the
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
language provided by hhs and discussed
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't have anything based on the
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'm thinking maybe we need
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
to do because
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh i i do want to move past this issue
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh today to put as much stuff to bed as
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
i i i think i would kick the can on this
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
over to the senate um
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
because there's a couple different views
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
on what we should
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
what this language should really be um
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i think we can accept the governor's
 
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.070 align:start position:0%
so i think we can accept the governor's
language

01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then i can take a homework
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
assignment to try to
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
figure out between mr skibby and
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative marsh and
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
in the governor's office what this what
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
this language probably really wants to
 
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.830 align:start position:0%
this language probably really wants to
be

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's my thinking
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
well i mean i was i was thinking
 
01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:04.890 align:start position:0%
i guess i was thinking that um
 
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:06.550 align:start position:0%
i guess i was thinking that um
[Music]

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
we could just take it out i was actually
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
on the i was actually on the opposite
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
thinking here that we should just take
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
and um if there's a need for it i guess
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
it could come we'd come in in the senate
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
um if there's no need for it then it'll
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
just stay out
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay i could go with that approach as
 
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.870 align:start position:0%
okay i could go with that approach as
well

01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
so um are there are there
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
is there more conversation about this
 
01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
is there more conversation about this
anyone

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what happened to my screen
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
where i see everyone
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
let me see oh there it is uh
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay do you have further comment your
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
hands still up representative
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
oh sorry sorry about that
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm blowering it there any comment is
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
anyone predisposed
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
to go to do anything with this 25 other
 
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:01.270 align:start position:0%
to go to do anything with this 25 other
than

01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
either keep it or or delete it
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't have an amendment to delete
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
it so i think what
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
if we did vote we'd be asking missed
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
ripple unless you created an amendment
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
to delete it did you
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
radar ripple okay that's twice
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's great all right so i can bring
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think you've done this before
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
he's a mind reader yeah
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay so we have an amendment um
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty simple one does anyone
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
to accept uh 20 21 0
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
9 0 4 hotel yes that's it
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay so um representative bean would you
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
would you call a vote yes sir
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative wallner
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative erif
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards yes
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm representative bean i'm a yes
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative wyler
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
is still absent that's six zero
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
motion being past six to the zero uh
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is adopted we'll delete section 25.
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
all right uh very good uh so
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
we've done 24 25 26 i think we've moved
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
past 33 34
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
is not ready for a vote we will not vote
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
vote on that today
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
take a vote on monday and i know that's
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
pushing it
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
mr ripple but i don't i don't think um
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is this is right for a vote okay
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we just talked about
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
section 35 before lunch
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
so let's let's get a sense of where the
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee's at on that one
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a document that you could
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
show us to just show their
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know the page they used the five uh
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
the matrix with the five items i think
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
this is today's agenda
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
um i can't find it i don't have it up
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
so just to kick off a conversation
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
i've not read the report um
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
it's it it it seems to me like a
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
m is probably a pretty credible
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
organization and it seems to me
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
like they grounded their findings in
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
hard academic data um
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen the way they did their
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
cost analysis or benefit analysis
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
but you know i i i would be more
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable if i did
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
just look at it to double check it
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
but um but we're getting this a little
 
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:39.430 align:start position:0%
but um but we're getting this a little
late

01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
late
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
in the process so that that's
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
it um and i i have not
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason taken the time to to
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
do a deep dive into this a
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
m study or these recommendations
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i think i could get pretty
 
01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:57.910 align:start position:0%
uh i i think i could get pretty
comfortable

01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
with the top four um
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
the the bottom one the dd redesign may
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
have the biggest
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
actual impact but uh
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
i i personally am in uh
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
a little uncomfortable with the notion
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
that the state is
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
picking where group homes are going to
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
go and and
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
and those aren't developing organically
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the community and i think i mentioned
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
why because is the state the state
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
funding as i remember on group homes
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
is is actually to keep them sustained is
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
actually pretty small it's remarkably
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
small it could be like
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
50 or something i wish i recalled the
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
numbers but
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
the charitable donations for ongoing
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance of these things
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
is really critical so
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
so i i could see being an advocate of
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
the top four
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i would just really need to be
 
01:34:53.119 --> 01:34:54.629 align:start position:0%
and i would just really need to be
convinced

01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
convinced
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
to go with the fifth one the dd redesign
 
01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:58.070 align:start position:0%
to go with the fifth one the dd redesign
that

01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's my conversation does anyone want
 
01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
that's my conversation does anyone want
to

01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not inclined to go over 10
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
at this point in the process um
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
from sort of macro point of view the
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
first four also look
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
relatively reasonable to me in terms of
 
01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:27.430 align:start position:0%
relatively reasonable to me in terms of
something

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
or we could pass on to the senate
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
presumably they will have
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
had more time to get in and actually
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
analyze this but if the choices are
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
between the 10 million or nothing i
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
would go with nothing
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
if the choice was something in between i
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
would as you indicated that the first
 
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.629 align:start position:0%
would as you indicated that the first
four

01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
seemed like a reasonable thing to budget
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
at a late date since the total i think
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
is around 100 600 000
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it is about six hundred thousand
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
good good eye uh
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um i'm just wondering about
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
what if we started this in the second
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
year instead of starting it
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
um in the first year of the biennium
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's a four-year project and i know
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
everybody would like to start it in the
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
first year but
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's something we've done quite often
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
with projects like this is
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
is in order to save some money in this
 
01:36:38.239 --> 01:36:38.709 align:start position:0%
is in order to save some money in this
year's

01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
in this budget started in the second
 
01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.070 align:start position:0%
in this budget started in the second
year

01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
um and cut the cut the expenditure in
 
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:45.510 align:start position:0%
um and cut the cut the expenditure in
half

01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
half
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
maybe um so that we spread it out
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
um in the first four years that we're
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
doing it um
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
it becomes a five-year project from now
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
to uh get ready for it so to speak and
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
um start it
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
in january of next year instead of this
 
01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:06.310 align:start position:0%
in january of next year instead of this
year

01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i mean it's not the appropriation
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't lapse
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
anyway until june we can extend the
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
elapsed date out to um
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2024 maybe
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
um and look about saving some money that
 
01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.070 align:start position:0%
um and look about saving some money that
way

01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
just a thought thank you for that uh
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
i i mean i think that's a really i think
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's a really good
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
idea i think it's a great idea because
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
it would also give the department
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
some time to um have more conversation
 
01:37:43.119 --> 01:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
some time to um have more conversation
with

01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
providers at this point i'm i'm a little
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
worried about
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
i want to be sure that providers um
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
have have the time to for the input that
 
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.189 align:start position:0%
have have the time to for the input that
um

01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
is really important for the planning of
 
01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:58.790 align:start position:0%
is really important for the planning of
this

01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
and as far i know that the first four
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
are very important and i agree they
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
sound very good i really
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
the dd one i'm very concerned about us
 
01:38:10.639 --> 01:38:12.310 align:start position:0%
the dd one i'm very concerned about us
having

01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
that that just seems like
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
incredible that we are um
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
sending new hampshire residents to
 
01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.390 align:start position:0%
sending new hampshire residents to
florida

01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
florida
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
to be cared for they're away from their
 
01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.070 align:start position:0%
to be cared for they're away from their
families

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're some of the most people with
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
some of the most
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
um intense problems and issues
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
of any clients that we have in in our
 
01:38:42.719 --> 01:38:43.590 align:start position:0%
of any clients that we have in in our
systems

01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
and we send them to florida and i i
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
think we i think we need to find a way
 
01:38:48.159 --> 01:38:49.270 align:start position:0%
think we i think we need to find a way
to

01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that they've identified this i
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
had never
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
really been aware that there were that
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
many um
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
that many of these clients out of state
 
01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.270 align:start position:0%
that many of these clients out of state
so

01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
and especially that far out of state um
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i i would like to see it i think the
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
idea of pushing it out a year is a
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
is a good idea and it also gives us time
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
to talk with providers
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
your hand is up and you're free to speak
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative norgren
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay i didn't hear you sorry um yes i
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
would echo what
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
mary jane said i think there are all
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of concerns
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
to us that never even knew about the
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
people being sent to florida we knew
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
about the people
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
the children who were going out of state
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
who weren't in sununu
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
um so there are all kinds of questions
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
about the cost
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
of that and where that even appears in
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
all those people have gone to florida
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
and other places
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
um and i and then i would also have a
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
we can extend it i agree with not
 
01:40:06.719 --> 01:40:08.070 align:start position:0%
we can extend it i agree with not
starting

01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
starting
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
till the 2023 but i'm not sure we can
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
extend it to 2024 there would be an
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative well do you want to you
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
know let's
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
mr ripple do do you understand the
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
question there and representative
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
i think it could be extended
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i just think we need a lot more
 
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
yeah i just think we need a lot more
information

01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
about the current situation before we
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
can really launch into
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
a whole new plan thank you
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
um i tend to agree with that concept i'm
 
01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.149 align:start position:0%
um i tend to agree with that concept i'm
wondering

01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
if we're going down that road would it
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
just make sense to put in a bill
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
next year to that we'll go through the
 
01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.470 align:start position:0%
next year to that we'll go through the
process

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
and we'd also have more importantly i
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
guess a better idea of
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
finances the state's finances by that
 
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.950 align:start position:0%
finances the state's finances by that
time

01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
will make it easier to uh perhaps
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
go for the whole failure at that point
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
and be able to deal with all the people
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
in florida as well as all the other
 
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.310 align:start position:0%
in florida as well as all the other
parts

01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
parts
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting that another
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
alternative would just be to
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh try to have this become a house bill
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
with a fiscal note sent to a policy
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee and we would
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
correct what do people think about that
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
as an alternative
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
um i guess i would think if we wanted to
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
go that route
 
01:42:00.390 --> 01:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
i would rather that we um pull it out
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
similar to what we've done with the um
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
forensic unit and a couple of other
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
things i think and keeping ourselves
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
our you know we heard the first thing
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
but keep it ourselves
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
and we work on it so that it be um
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
possibly we could
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
put could finish it this session um or
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
have it ready to go so that they could
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
actually start on into january
 
01:42:26.229 --> 01:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
of this year of next year rather the
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
second year of the biennium
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i think that we've started to hear
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
maybe we should continue it um and maybe
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
we could ask
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
um whatever policy committee be it um
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
health and human services or whether to
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
sit in with us
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
i know that's something we've done in
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
the past in this committee
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's had um one or other policy
 
01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
committee sit in with us
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
and work with us on it um but i think it
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see us do similar to what
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing on the forensic unit um and
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
keep it here and work on it
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
after i know that that um you've done
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
that with the other one
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think that that might be a
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
route to go where we started
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
and it's something that that we know
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at and how we're
 
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
we want to deal with it um maybe combine
 
01:43:12.629 --> 01:43:12.639 align:start position:0%
the ideas
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
the two ideas of um pulling it out and
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
working on it but keeping it here and
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
and having us where we know the money
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
part of it at least
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
and how to spend it and how to go
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
forward with it do it that way
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
all right um representative aldrin
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
walner and nordgren sorry you just
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
became one person there
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh do you if uh you all had
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
previous comments you know do you want
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
to take another
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
iteration here go ahead
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
represent norton yeah no i think we're
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
all sort of going the same direction
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
want to start it now i i and i would
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
maybe agree with kathy that we could
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
include hhs committee in our discussions
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i just think we're not ready to do
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
this i think we need to do more research
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
on how all those cases are handled now
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
what's the budget for that
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
and dig down deeper and i think we need
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
the time for that rather than to start
 
01:44:13.679 --> 01:44:14.310 align:start position:0%
the time for that rather than to start
it

01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay um i i just uh
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative erf your hand could you
 
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
i said i didn't know how to wrap you go
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and i'll i'll come in after you're
 
01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.310 align:start position:0%
ahead and i'll i'll come in after you're
done

01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're good go we want to hear what you
 
01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:39.669 align:start position:0%
you're good go we want to hear what you
say

01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
okay um i uh i guess kathy's more
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the process of course than
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
i am but her suggestion sounds very
 
01:44:46.159 --> 01:44:46.870 align:start position:0%
i am but her suggestion sounds very
reasonable

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
to extract that i guess as a retained
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill sort of we can do that out of hp2
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's what she's kind of
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting and that seems like a
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach going forward
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um i i would just remind people
 
01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.870 align:start position:0%
okay so um i i would just remind people
um

01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
what the administrative cost here is and
 
01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:06.149 align:start position:0%
what the administrative cost here is and
and

01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we have the bandwidth
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
to do it and when i say we i mean the
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
the royal we of the lba uh we've got
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripple uh scheduled to be with us
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think on april 12th to deal with the
 
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.109 align:start position:0%
i think on april 12th to deal with the
forensic

01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
forensic
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
hospital but but he's going to be in the
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
throes of doing this
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
all this again with the senate and so
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of bandwidth
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
that that he's got available to support
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
us with meetings and
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
all and so i would just make want to
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
that if it's the sense of the committee
 
01:45:43.590 --> 01:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
do what we're doing with the forensic
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
hospital that we just do it in light
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the idea that um the lba
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
is a scarce resource for the next couple
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
of months and we
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
need to be careful not to over try to
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
over commit them
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
but uh rupper is i don't i don't know
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
who raised their hand first nordran or
 
01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
walt walner so um represent nordron
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
no i just wanted to say i don't think
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
this needs to be done
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
at the same time the senate is working
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
on the budget i think this is something
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
we can do
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
later i don't think we need to rush with
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
it because
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
i think if we if we make the decision
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
that there
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
will be no money allocated for the first
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
year the biennium i think that's
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
something we can take our time with
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so so just to pursue that
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
what what is the on off switch for the
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
second year
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
i mean just if you imagine that we did
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
spend time on it
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we and we decided sometime and say
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
august or something that that the second
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
year isn't
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
ready either uh if we put it into hb2
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
now what is the off switch if if we
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
if we hit that situation
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know i'll i'll just turn the phone
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
um well i don't know what the off switch
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
is i
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i really liked kathy's first
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
proposal of pushing it out
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
a year um and but getting going i
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a little worried that if we
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't have something in the budget if we
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't have something in the budget to
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
address it it will
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
um not happen during this biennium
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
i mean we might have hearings we might
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
have discussions
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
but the thought that we're going to be
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
appropriating money off
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
in the off-budget year seems unlikely to
 
01:47:45.679 --> 01:47:47.030 align:start position:0%
in the off-budget year seems unlikely to
me

01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
so to get the so if we
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
take this out and we don't leave
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
something in so that they can start
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
get going in the second year push that
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
date out a bit
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
um i i just feel like we're going to
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
lose the biennium and i think
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
i i just got i for my for myself i just
 
01:48:10.239 --> 01:48:10.550 align:start position:0%
i i just got i for my for myself i just
got

01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
so concerned about those people i mean i
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
just had not been aware
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we had 38 people out of state
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
and um that i really felt like
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
they would be much better served and
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
their families would be better served if
 
01:48:24.639 --> 01:48:25.270 align:start position:0%
their families would be better served if
they

01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
had opportunities here in new hampshire
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
to receive their care
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to see us that part of the
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
report i really would like to see ask it
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i think the other parts um that they
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't cost a lot they're significant
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
also um i
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
i just i'm not sure what the off switch
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
but i do think that we could it would be
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
better if we would leave
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
something in and have it start um maybe
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
just my thoughts so may i ask you a
 
01:48:59.679 --> 01:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
just my thoughts so may i ask you a
question

01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
so i think i think based on what you've
 
01:49:05.119 --> 01:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
so i think i think based on what you've
said

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
maybe uh there's a possibility where you
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
satisfied with in the second year
 
01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:13.030 align:start position:0%
satisfied with in the second year
because

01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
these this was four group homes i
 
01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:16.229 align:start position:0%
these this was four group homes i
believe

01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
what what if we were to say in the
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
second year one group home or two group
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
homes but not maybe four
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know is there is there another way
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
to slice this
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
to space it and and get going but
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
get going with some um
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
some training wheels what do you think
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
about how do you react to that
 
01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.830 align:start position:0%
about how do you react to that
possibility

01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
um i guess i didn't
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
he i i'm sorry that i did not
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that i did not hear
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear four i i know you had
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
referred to it before and i just must
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
have missed
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
um in the presentation i must have
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
missed that it was
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
four group homes um
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
for some reason i wrote down actually i
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
thought it was
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
actually i thought it was more than that
 
01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
actually i thought it was more than that
um

01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
can anyone clarify that data point i i'm
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it was four i'm like
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
85 confident whoever
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
can verify that data point just speak up
 
01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:27.270 align:start position:0%
can verify that data point just speak up
because

01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
there are four hands up four is what i
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
remember down
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
so representative rogers your hand is up
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
have something to share i had four
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
written down but
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have a proposal or
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
proposition for you
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to give me the
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
weekend to work with um representative
 
01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.070 align:start position:0%
weekend to work with um representative
walner

01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
walner
 
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
an amendment and kevin ripple amendment
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
that would um
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
give us um some starting money but also
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
incorporated a plan where the um
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
division would be able to work on what
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
we want to do the second year so that we
 
01:51:10.159 --> 01:51:10.950 align:start position:0%
we want to do the second year so that we
um

01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
we give some startup money for the
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
second year that would accomplish
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
enough so we get going but also give the
 
01:51:17.679 --> 01:51:18.390 align:start position:0%
enough so we get going but also give the
division

01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
um some capacity to work on it what
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
what process and how we move forward so
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't do
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
the entire expenditure but we do expend
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
some part of the money and i would have
 
01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:29.910 align:start position:0%
some part of the money and i would have
a

01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment um as soon as i get it i'll
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
forward it to you and then
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
with your permission if um you want to
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
we can forward it to the entire division
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
i'll try to
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
do it as quickly as i can but i think
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to take
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
talking to all those people to come up
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the answers that are being
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
questioned right now
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
but i'd be willing to work on that and
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
try to put it together if you're
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
willing to allow me that time so
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
i i love everything he said and i
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and i want to say yes but
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
before i say
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh go for it let's let's just touch base
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
with mr ripple because
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have some timelines here what what
 
01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:05.830 align:start position:0%
we have some timelines here what what
what

01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
what what do you think uh kevin about
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
us having a proposal over the weekend
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
and and talking about it on monday and
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
where where does that take us
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
i think that would be fine um so i think
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
i heard you mentioned previously that
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
you wanted to vote everything out
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
if not on monday then on tuesday and
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
that would certainly provide time to
 
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
have an amendment by either monday
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon or tuesday morning
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
i guess the only issue is if the
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
committee decided to revise that
 
01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:37.430 align:start position:0%
committee decided to revise that
amendment

01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
into something different it might take a
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
little bit longer
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
so so with that representative rogers i
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
i would i'd thank you for
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
the offer and ask you to make it happen
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and then coordinate it how you see
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
fit over the weekend so that we can
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
discuss it on monday
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
and if i can possibly get it to you and
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
and mr ripple prior to uh
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
to monday i will um i will
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
as quickly as i can so so i
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think i've heard the consensus that
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
that that the people on this phone call
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
i haven't actually heard from
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative bean who may have a
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
different opinion but
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
that that uh that the consensus seems to
 
01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
that that uh that the consensus seems to
be

01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:53:24.070 --> 01:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
that we're okay with the first four
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
items and the
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
and what we're really just trying to
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
figure out is the right way to handle
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding and and
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you're gonna have a
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
proposal that deals with all five of
 
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:38.950 align:start position:0%
proposal that deals with all five of
these

01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
or just just the dd redesign
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure yet i'm gonna try to see
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
what makes everyone the happiest
 
01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:50.870 align:start position:0%
what makes everyone the happiest
okay

01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm good with that uh
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative wallner your hand is up
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative rogers your hand is
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
still up
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
oh that's just because i forgot to put
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
it down sorry okay
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i just you still have a floor if you
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
want it
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
um okay so uh let's
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
if we can can you take us back mr ripple
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we're sort of
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh tweaking 35 there where
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
at all will come back and we'll talk
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
about that some more on monday
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh what's going on with 37
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
that was the 1.5 million appropriation
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
that you discussed oh yeah
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we deleted that okay uh 38.
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
this is the one we talked about with the
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
200 000
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
yes all right so
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
i just think it should have already been
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
in the appropriations bill it should
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
already be in hb1
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
and they say that they overlooked it
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
but if it's an ongoing operation in an
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing program
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how you overlook
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
something like that so
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
i i i'm okay with like i could see
 
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
accepting 38
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
and zeroing out the additional money so
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they feel like they've got the
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
authority to proceed but
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
they need to figure out the money
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
because it's an ongoing operation
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
that's me starting a conversation that's
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
not my final
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
thought but but that's kind of what i'm
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about that did
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
any representative earth well
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
i think we may have left or perhaps
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
maybe i
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
may have left it that karen can suggest
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
the camera might suggest a change
 
01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.709 align:start position:0%
the camera might suggest a change
request

01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the hb1
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think what karen talked about earlier
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
was if you were to delete section 38
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
she would hope for an appropriation in
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
house bill 1. so they would continue to
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
get that 200
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
000 but there would also be a federal
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
match associated with it
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
right understood and i believe she also
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
indicated that she could make a
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
change request to affect that
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
yes but i think she's asking for
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
support for 200 000 more to go into the
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's not just a change request it's it's
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
also more money
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's right okay that's certainly true
 
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
it's right okay that's certainly true
yes

01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think what she requested is the same
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's currently
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted in section 38
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
this would move it out of hp2 and we'd
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
need to have an amendment to plus up hb1
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
by 200 000.
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
right so that'd be the change request
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes so i'm being parsimonious and
 
01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.750 align:start position:0%
yes so i'm being parsimonious and
thinking

01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
you don't need another 200 000. figure
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
out how to get it done
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
but uh but that's why that's a
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
conversation point
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chair i have already done
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
the change request
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
for karen to move uh
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate that 200 000 into house bill
 
01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
appropriate that 200 000 into house bill
one

01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
with a seventy five percent match so a
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
total of
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
eight hundred thousand six hundred
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
thousand being federal
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand being general funds
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know that she had time to
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
um submit that to mr ripple
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
that makes it sound like a bargain right
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
getting 200 you get 800 000 for 200 000
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's pretty great not a bad rate
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what's your question would
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
that be using that ratio could
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
could we do 50 and get 200 which is what
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
mary are you comfortable answering that
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's a
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's a tough question i would i would
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
have to check with other folks within
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
the department before i'd be able to
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
so if uh mr ripple
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
assuming you had in your inbox but
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
you've not looked at it yet
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
a change request for that to go into hb1
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh is that something that is appropriate
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
for us to vote on and
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
and can we vote on that monday if
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
assuming it's in your inbox
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
you could i don't have it yet but um if
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
i could get that then
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
you could vote on it as soon as i have
 
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.229 align:start position:0%
you could vote on it as soon as i have
it

01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
so mary do you have a thought there
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
when do you think he'll have it i can
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
send it over
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
um immediately i just need to attach it
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the email
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
so while you're doing that let's come
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
back to 38 and
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
what's what i forget what we're doing
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
with 41.
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
oh me i keep forgetting what we're doing
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
with 41 because i dropped the ball again
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire on what her
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
reasons were for not
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i apologize to the committee this
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
one's on me
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
i messed up and i did ask sorry i did
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
ask nancy and mike hoffman in division
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
one if division one had any input into
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
these sections since they were
 
02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
these sections since they were
originally

02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
originally
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
assigned to them um and their answer was
 
02:00:06.639 --> 02:00:07.189 align:start position:0%
assigned to them um and their answer was
no

02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
so this is where i need the the the
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
elders of the committee to give me a
 
02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:20.149 align:start position:0%
elders of the committee to give me a
recommendation

02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
should should we just approve this in
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh section 41 and and
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
work it in the senate or should we
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
delete it here
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
and allow the senate to add it back if
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
they want
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
or a third choice
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you got any
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i think that we should leave it
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
done the work in the budget for this and
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
what i heard was that that it was all
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
something that the department and
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
the licensing people had been working on
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
for a long time so
 
02:01:18.870 --> 02:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
i would leave it in if there's problems
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
i guess people will arrive in the senate
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't really have anybody come and
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
speak against this
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
no we didn't other than a hallway
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
conversation i had with
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire there was no
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
negative input
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have any testimony in a
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
it has not had a lot of controversy
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
so i would leave it in okay i
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i i see your point let's let's let's
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
throw it open is there anyone
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the participants list that wants to
 
02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the participants list that wants to
comment

02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
on section 41.
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
we just lost an attendee so so
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
i guess they don't want to say all right
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative only your hand is up
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
did you have more
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
no no that that was it i am going to be
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
leaving though shortly so
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so uh i would
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
but i
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with that i'm i'm okay with
 
02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:36.229 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with that i'm i'm okay with
that

02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation i think i think that's
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
a fine recommendation
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
you do you want to make a motion that we
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
accept section 41 since that's what
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
we've been doing
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
sure i'll make a motion that we accept
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
second

02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
not hearing any uh representative bean
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
are you ready to take a a roll call
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair representative walner
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes wait a second i i don't are we still
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
conversation piece of this because you
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
hit you put your hand up
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
before he asks you your vote do you have
 
02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:33.270 align:start position:0%
before he asks you your vote do you have
so

02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
so the motion is on the floor is that
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're about to vote on whether or not
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
division 3 wants to accept
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
section 41 of hb2 okay and the motion is
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
too accepted is that correct
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
yes sir yes thank you sorry about you
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's all right i'm sorry to interrupt
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
the vote but i i
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
i think your hand went up before we
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
actually took a vote
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
so so so go ahead and and start your
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
roll call over again
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative bean okay representative
 
02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
representative bean okay representative
wallner

02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
wallner
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative nordwin yes
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative rogers yes representative
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative edwards yes
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
and representative bean would vote yes
 
02:04:26.719 --> 02:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
and representative bean would vote yes
uh

02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative weiler still absent
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
so um mr ripple
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
would you would you uh take us back to
 
02:04:39.199 --> 02:04:41.430 align:start position:0%
would you would you uh take us back to
the

02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes just one moment
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're about to we're about a few minutes
 
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:55.990 align:start position:0%
we're about to we're about a few minutes
from

02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
losing some of our committee for a
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
little while
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
um so let's just take a look at what we
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
what we still have to do
 
02:05:07.350 --> 02:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
one that you could do right now is
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
section 38 i've gotten the email from
 
02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:09.830 align:start position:0%
section 38 i've gotten the email from
mary

02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
mary
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh so you have the house bill one change
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
that would accompany that and i also
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
delete section 38 from house bill 2 so
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
you could take care of both sides of
 
02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
you could take care of both sides of
that

02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to so we could go either
 
02:05:22.719 --> 02:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to so we could go either
way

02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
or we could do both right
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay we could do both so so tell me
 
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
what's below
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
on the second page or third page did you
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
i think they're only the veterans
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
sections okay because i thought i had
 
02:05:37.599 --> 02:05:38.629 align:start position:0%
sections okay because i thought i had
asked

02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the informal uh hb2s to be added to
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
this list
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i forgot i forgot to
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
include those so that's
 
02:05:51.109 --> 02:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
but i and the reason i was hoping it
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
would be there
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
is so that we can talk about it today to
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
get a sense
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
one of them was um
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
related to the email i sent i got some
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
feedback from representative rogers
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
about a proposed change to the way
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
the forensic hospital was going to look
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
and she had a couple of
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
comments for me uh representative walner
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know correctly pointed out that
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're planning to discuss it on april
 
02:06:22.639 --> 02:06:23.669 align:start position:0%
we're planning to discuss it on april
12th

02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
12th
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
and um and so so
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
while our colleagues are away
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh the people who remain
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
could could talk about that proposal
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
just to share information
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
um there will be no votes and if we get
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
through with that conversation
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
we could just go into recess until four
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock if you think that's enough time
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're getting pretty close to being done
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
anyway so
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
um so let's go ahead and
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
and look at the the one or two votes
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.119 --> 02:07:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
so i'll show you the house bill one side
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
so the big one that that didn't get
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
written there that's the informal one
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
is the personnel reductions i
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
wanted i wanted to be able to talk to
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
people about the potential of that one
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
and and we really need our full
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
so this is the change sheet that mary
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
sent over and uh
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
if you need if you need a further
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
explanation perhaps you can speak to
 
02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:54.629 align:start position:0%
explanation perhaps you can speak to
that

02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
so just walk us through what's going on
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal show us
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
his general funds request and what the
 
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:04.790 align:start position:0%
his general funds request and what the
new

02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
amount would be just to be really
 
02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:10.629 align:start position:0%
amount would be just to be really
obvious

02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay well so for this section i can pull
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
up the governor's
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. uh it was a 200 000
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation in 22
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i'll bring that up momentarily but
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
you can see down here
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
the department is requesting essentially
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
the same but it includes the
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
federal funds of six hundred thousand
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
so i'll bring up the governor now let's
 
02:08:35.119 --> 02:08:52.390 align:start position:0%
so i'll bring up the governor now let's
see

02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
and here is the original two hundred
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar appropriation
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir can you do you know where in the
 
02:08:59.040 --> 02:08:59.669 align:start position:0%
yes sir can you do you know where in the
governor's

02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
budget hb1 that the line item is that
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
we're adding to
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
account 9540 and
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:18.069 align:start position:0%
 
services

02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
so so can you ver just verify for us
 
02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
so so can you ver just verify for us
that

02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
um this change
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
is using the proper governor's budget
 
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
is using the proper governor's budget
baseline

02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
baseline
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean normally that's a that we
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
would just assume that's what happened
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
but i don't wanna assume
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:44.840 --> 02:10:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay so the number we're talking about
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
right now is 26.070
 
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay so
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
it should be 26.270 when we go look at
 
02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:42.670 align:start position:0%
the change request
 
02:10:42.670 --> 02:10:46.709 align:start position:0%
the change request
[Music]

02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it's slightly more than that sorry
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
there's that 804 thing floating in there
 
02:10:52.719 --> 02:10:53.589 align:start position:0%
there's that 804 thing floating in there
that's

02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
inconsequential right is that the actual
 
02:10:57.119 --> 02:11:00.950 align:start position:0%
inconsequential right is that the actual
number

02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
what's your question representative erf
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
did she actually because of whatever
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
she's doing put in two hundred thousand
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
eight hundred and four dollars it was
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
804 already there says he's really
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
adding just a 200
 
02:11:11.599 --> 02:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
adding just a 200
000

02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
if i may i uh noticed when
 
02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
preparing this change request that that
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
804 dollars was budgeted in
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
error that that agency income will not
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually be received and took the
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct that at this time
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is why it's slightly more than the
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
200 000.
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay but i'm just trying to balance
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
things for our analysis i should just
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
use the 200 000 the 804 or something
 
02:11:43.830 --> 02:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
else altogether
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the 804 is not related to the 200
 
02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.109 align:start position:0%
yeah the 804 is not related to the 200
000.

02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
000.
 
02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay and can you tell me what line
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
number or lump 9 line numbers
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
so this this would be adding to class
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
102 in accounting unit 59.52
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i used a prior change
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
request and rushed and didn't update all
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that i should have so my
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
apologies for that
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
i will send kevin a corrected one that
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
will only change the accounting unit
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
will not change
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
the actual dollars um but it would be in
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
class 102
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
which is contract line let's
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
let's uh let's wait until you've had the
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
right time to make sure that you're
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh confident in the product let's not
 
02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:29.830 align:start position:0%
uh confident in the product let's not
vote

02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
um we have colleagues that need to get
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
to another meeting
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
so um i
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually why don't we just go into
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
recess until four o'clock
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it may just take a few minutes uh
 
02:12:44.229 --> 02:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
wind up but i'm hoping that
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative weiler will show up with
 
02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
representative weiler will show up with
that

that
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh ways and means update that that would
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
be worth listening to on a late friday
 
02:12:53.679 --> 02:12:55.109 align:start position:0%
be worth listening to on a late friday

02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
back to you in a bit unless you're ready
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
to just speak extemporaneously
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
whenever you whenever you want i can
 
02:18:46.309 --> 02:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
give you i can give you the short
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
version or a longer version
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
let's hit the short version because i i
 
02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
among others i think have just been
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
dying to hear the official update
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
okay taking into account the tax cuts
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
that are in hb2
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
and the new revenue they saw and they
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
all they met for days on this
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
they come up with 2022 with an
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
additional 51.9
 
02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars and then in 2023
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
with an additional 75.8 million dollars
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
for a total of 127 million
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
in this biennium over what the governor
 
02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:27.589 align:start position:0%
in this biennium over what the governor
had

02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
so this is above the governor's initial
 
02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:32.469 align:start position:0%
so this is above the governor's initial
estimate

02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
upon which this revenue upon which this
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
budget was based
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
so now there's more revenue
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
than what we started out with in the
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
i anticipating the questions um i think
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
folks would like to know
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are as chair of
 
02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:52.550 align:start position:0%
what your thoughts are as chair of
finance

02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
finance
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
about um
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know giving us a target because we
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
we have to hit a target monday or
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
tuesday i think or
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
we it's gonna we're gonna end up with a
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
number one way or the other
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
and we're either gonna hit a target or
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
not what what would you have us do
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
you think well i think based upon
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
what we heard in our initial interviews
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
with the departments and the bureaus and
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
all that stuff
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
they're not even up to what was uh
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
budgeted in 2021 so
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
to go and build on that is
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think going to be difficult for them
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know i i think we could we could
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh save some money even over what the
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
governor has
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
because if we can get a straight answer
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
from them and see
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
where the vacancies are and so on and
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
closing the sununu center yet but sir
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
we we wanted to have that um with you
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
returning because i
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
i came up with some language thinking i
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
understood what you were thinking
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and when i shared it with uh with
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
um he he he let me know that i i was off
 
02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
um he he he let me know that i i was off
target

02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
target
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and so uh what i'd like to do sir is
 
02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
and and so uh what i'd like to do sir is
uh

02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
let's we we we forestalled a vote on
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
section 24
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
and there's two votes in there there's
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh an hb1 proposal and an hb2
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
proposal this is the money that's
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
related to the county cap
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and so so we'd like to uh
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
give you um some background on that and
 
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:33.349 align:start position:0%
give you um some background on that and
that's

02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
one of the big ones that we should we
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
should vote on today i think
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
is good so um if you could
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
um mr ripple is it better
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's start with hb2 and and
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
then we'll go to hb1
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
so so i'll summarize this representative
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
on your behalf if that's okay and then
 
02:22:12.399 --> 02:22:13.510 align:start position:0%
on your behalf if that's okay and then
um

02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and that way you can correct me if i
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
make mistakes
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh and i i realize as i'm looking at
 
02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we're doing with 14
 
02:22:30.950 --> 02:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
through 18. so that didn't last very
 
02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:32.950 align:start position:0%
through 18. so that didn't last very
long

02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
would you tell us what uh h what 14
 
02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
through 18 do again
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
well let me just tell you what the three
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
changes so this is the county cap
 
02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
portion of hp2 representative wyler
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
and there are three parts to what
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
used to be a single part previously it
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
only had the numbers in there and we'll
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
come to that
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
bit um now there are uh
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
three components to it and i've got to
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
so one of them changes
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
the order in which the funding streams
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
are applied and there are three funding
 
02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
are applied and there are three funding
streams

02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
streams
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's the five million dollar general
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
fund piece that is
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
in law there's the
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh general fund the the increase of the
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
general fund that we put in
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
to bring the county cap down and then
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's the county cap
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
itself so presently
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
the two as i understand it and i think i
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
had this right before karen
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think corrected me slightly in certain
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
places but i think the general gist of
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is correct
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
presently the general funds are applied
 
02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:54.950 align:start position:0%
presently the general funds are applied
first

02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
and the county funding
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry presently i assign it
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
backwards again presently the county
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
funding is spent
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
first and then the general funds are
 
02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
first and then the general funds are
applied

02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
applied
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
the effect of that is that if the
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
expenses are less than that total
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
essentially the state benefited from
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
their general funds not being applied
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
so one of the points of this amendment
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
is to
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
change that ordering so the county funds
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
are applied first
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then the general fund streams are
 
02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
and then the general fund streams are
applied

02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
and part of this and this is all in
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
discussion with the
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
department in fact there's probably
 
02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
still a person from the department here
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
can speak to this if need be
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the enhanced fmap which is not
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
how how would the county funding how
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
would the county homes
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
capture that and it apparently is
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to capture that directly
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
so this is in some sense a balancing out
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
of that so that's
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
part one part two are the numbers
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
and what we did in the budget which
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've not yet
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
gotten to but what we're proposing to do
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
is to increase the county cap from the
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
fy 21 base by two percent
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
in the fy 23 and by a further two
 
02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
in the fy 23 and by a further two
percent

02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
in fy 24. so those are the numbers that
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
kevin is showing us now
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then the third part of the of the
 
02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:29.510 align:start position:0%
and then the third part of the of the
amendment

02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh puts in an ongoing increase
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
of two percent per year the county cap
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
going forward obviously the many effects
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
but one of the effects of that is that
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
when the next
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
biennium comes around and the hhs is
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
doing their budgeting
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
their base budgeting will include the
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
two percent increase to the county cap
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
the five million dollars that they put
 
02:25:58.240 --> 02:25:58.790 align:start position:0%
the five million dollars that they put
in

02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:26:02.309 --> 02:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
now as a default um
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
no i don't say place holder but as the
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
default value since that's what's in
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
statute currently does that summarize it
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
well enough for you
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think it does and then you
 
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
you had another discussion i think on
 
02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
you had another discussion i think on
resequencing

02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
resequencing
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
how different funds get spent
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
down first and currently the model is
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
that the county funds
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
get spent down first so if they don't
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
need to spend everything the county is
 
02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:32.950 align:start position:0%
need to spend everything the county is
generally

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
generally
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
spent first anyways but they're going to
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
invert the sequence to where the
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
county funds would be spent last
 
02:26:45.270 --> 02:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
meaning that they may get some benefit
 
02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:46.389 align:start position:0%
meaning that they may get some benefit
if

02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
everything doesn't get spent and there's
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
less spending than anticipated
 
02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct yes sir
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
the figures shown on the screen are in
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
the ones that are awesome i'm sorry go
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
ahead so
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
on line 24 where it says 123 million
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
point three
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that was the original
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
number and
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
and and based on a couple of things that
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth did and he's
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
going to show it to us on hb1
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that that number is now 129 million
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
so is that that's the number the state
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
is paying not the counties
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
see that better when we go look at hb1
 
02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:31.830 align:start position:0%
see that better when we go look at hb1
and

02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
we'll do that before we vote on anything
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
could i just jump in with one thing
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
there um yeah the numbers that you see
 
02:27:39.359 --> 02:27:39.990 align:start position:0%
there um yeah the numbers that you see
that

02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
on lines 24 and 25 those original
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
numbers of 123
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
and 126.9 those were for the current
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
2021 biennium
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's numbers for 22
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
were 148.9
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
and in 23 were again 148.9 so this
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
amendment brings that
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
brings those numbers down and this would
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
be the cap on county contributions this
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the state cost
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
so these are the revised numbers thank
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
should i bring up the excel sheet for
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
your php
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then represent earth do you want to
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
explain these sure
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
so first of all there's a change to
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the budgeting the expense side the line
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
number 504
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
which kevin can highlight the 10 million
 
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:03.270 align:start position:0%
which kevin can highlight the 10 million
dollars

02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
so it's on line 17 of the sheet there
 
02:29:09.270 --> 02:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
you go um
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
so based on a again an agreement or an
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
understanding with the hhs
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
the original budgeting apparently was
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
based on a number of
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
i think we said 4 100 beds and
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
it seems that a better estimate is 3 900
 
02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
it seems that a better estimate is 3 900
beds

02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
beds
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of fy20 or for fy 2022.
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
so that resulted in a 10 million dollar
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
reduction in the
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
in that 504 expense line for flight 2022
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
and then going forward they do expect
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
that as we come out of covid
 
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh the bed count will go back we'll
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
start back up again
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
and as patients are readmitted to the
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
so that reduction in the second year
 
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
2023 is
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
five million dollars and that has the
 
02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:57.270 align:start position:0%
five million dollars and that has the
effect

02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
effect
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
well of course that lowers the total
 
02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:00.870 align:start position:0%
well of course that lowers the total
costs

02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
of all the lines against which the
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
county cap applies
 
02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
which has the effect of on its own
 
02:30:08.790 --> 02:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
reducing the
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
county cap so then down below
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
when we get to the um the county cap
 
02:30:18.150 --> 02:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
number now the private local funds that
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
decreased from the
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
governor's number the 143.9 million
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
to yield a two percent increase over fy
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
21 in the county cap so it's it's
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
getting it down to a value of 124
 
02:30:34.319 --> 02:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
getting it down to a value of 124
million

02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
roughly by decreasing the
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
um private local funds budgeted by about
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
19.5 million
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
in fy 2022 and similarly in fy 2023
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
the county cap increases the further two
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
percent which is the 126
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
0.8 million um which results
 
02:30:57.910 --> 02:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
which causes the uh well which is a
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
result in it which which is caused by a
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
reduction in the county cap
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
of 17 million from the budgeted number
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
and which increases the general funds
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
um by that same amount this will be good
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
news for the meeting that
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
keith and i have to go to one o'clock on
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
i hope so so i'm just trying to remember
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
what was on
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
the hb2 amendment and i'm seeing 124.3
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
right and ly 22
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
does that need to be reflected in hp2
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like it was a higher
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
number on hb2 right
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
because on hb2 the 5 million dollars is
 
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:41.990 align:start position:0%
because on hb2 the 5 million dollars is
included

02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing you just made it
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
so so uh representative erf walked us
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
through this
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
and and uh we didn't we didn't really
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
have much
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
interactive discussion around it um
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh do you do you have any uh questions
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
or comments other than the this will be
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
good news on monday
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
it'll be good news on monday and we
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%

talked about it through the this week as
well

02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
i was well aware of what he wanted what
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
his intentions were i just hadn't seen
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%

02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%

thank you for doing all this work um
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
the counties have been
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
a part of this of this work and they
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
they think this is a good way to go
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
forward yeah that is my understanding
 
02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
forward yeah that is my understanding
and

02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%

02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps mary can speak to that if need
 
02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:04.710 align:start position:0%
perhaps mary can speak to that if need
be

02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
i was not involved in those
 
02:33:09.270 --> 02:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
conversations so we i think we may have
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh kate horgan on who is
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
i forget the name of the county
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
association but if you want to
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
association with counties you want to
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%

02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
counties are feeling about it because
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's a big
 
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's a big part of county government
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
hi yes it's kate horgan i'm the
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
association of counties and
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative walner we were
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
very involved with the construction of
 
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment and we are very happy
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
with where
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
where it is and would encourage you all
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
to adopt it into house bill 2.
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
are there other questions or
 
02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:00.469 align:start position:0%
are there other questions or
conversation

02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
i i i i would like us to uh
 
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
entertain a vote on hb2 as amended
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh for section what is a section
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
so so right now you're seeing what how
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
30 wait a second
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes this this amendment would replace
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
section 24.
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
i i'll make that motion if you want me
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
to do you want me to make it in
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%

you have an idea on that mr ripple it
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like it can be in one vote
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
um i would actually recommend two
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
separate motions since you're amending
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%

02:34:58.640 --> 02:34:59.830 align:start position:0%
both bills okay so i would move that we
accept

02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%

02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
well in this case let's look at the hb1
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.190 --> 02:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
miss please do you do you want us to
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
explain this or
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
or would you like mr ripple to we'll go
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
kevin i believe that's the original one
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
is this theory it does look like the
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
original bosnia it is the original one
 
02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
did i not send you the revised one i i
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
think you did let me just uh make sure i
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
have the right one
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh oh actually that was the one the one
 
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
that i just opened was the most recent
 
02:39:50.960 --> 02:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
that i just opened was the most recent
actually

02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
so i might suggest postponing this one
 
02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:06.150 align:start position:0%
so i might suggest postponing this one
until

02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
monday you could still vote on hb2
 
02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
monday you could still vote on hb2
though

02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
and and and then over the weekend you
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
kind of know what we're doing and it'd
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
be easy to integrate our vote i think
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay so let's let's go to
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay and this would simply delete the
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
delete that section and the
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation contained in it
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
right so so since this is so simple
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
can you pull up 38 so we can all
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
remember and
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler wasn't with us
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
earlier so he probably needs to see it
 
02:40:56.640 --> 02:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
earlier so he probably needs to see it
again

02:40:57.510 --> 02:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler we we had
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
mr david wetter's in here
 
02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh this morning uh and uh
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
we got more detail about this 200
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
000 it it it is an ongoing program
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
they did uh overlook uh including in an
 
02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:34.389 align:start position:0%
they did uh overlook uh including in an
hb1

02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
this 200 000 that is an hb 2
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh would be good to uh earn a federal
 
02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:42.870 align:start position:0%
uh would be good to uh earn a federal
match

02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
match
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
so this two hundred thousand gets
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
matched by another six hundred thousand
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so that's eight hundred thousand
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
dollars that comes
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
in on a revenue line if we accept the
 
02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:55.110 align:start position:0%
in on a revenue line if we accept the
idea

02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh and that eight hundred thousand
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars is going to
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh a contractor who's meaning
 
02:42:01.279 --> 02:42:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh a contractor who's meaning
maintaining

02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining
 
02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
the basically the architecture
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's uh sending out
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
something called an administ admissions
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
discharges and transfers message
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
to receiving systems that have
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
interfaces and so it's a it's an
 
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:22.710 align:start position:0%
interfaces and so it's a it's an
important

02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
aspect of the way that care is getting
 
02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:28.070 align:start position:0%
aspect of the way that care is getting
coordinated

02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
between the state and the communities
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
and between communities
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
and so there they have a plan to
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
expand the number of clinical users in
 
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so um so the idea though
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
is because it's an ongoing program it
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
was really in hb2
 
02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that uh even though
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
they'd forgotten the budget
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
that it got added back and while adding
 
02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
it back
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh there was a recognition that some
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal money would come along with it
 
02:43:05.990 --> 02:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
six hundred thousand
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
so um so the idea became
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
in our discussion well why don't we just
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
and delete section 38 because
 
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's this is already ongoing operations
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's an
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
ongoing program and and and to bring it
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
over into hb1
 
02:43:28.469 --> 02:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
um as a as a net increase
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's what we discussed
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
earlier i think
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh um ms khalis steve do you
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
did i do you think i said that right do
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
you want to change anything i said
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
no i think your description of that was
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative irf i still have a
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
question as to whether they need
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand dollars as a
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
request for an hb2 or eight hundred
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars as
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
which they get once they match it with
 
02:43:59.269 --> 02:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
the six hundred thousand dollars of
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
02:44:03.349 --> 02:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh if i'm a representative i was able to
 
02:44:03.990 --> 02:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh speak
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
with henry lipman the director of
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
medicaid services and he did confirm
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
that we do need the 200
 
02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:11.910 align:start position:0%
that we do need the 200
000.

02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
may i follow him yes um
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is what about the
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
well we can get federal match for the
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
so i think what representative irf is
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
asking is this really an
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
eight hundred 800 000 project there's a
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
number less than that i mean just
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
because we can get federal money
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding from the
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay first do you have a follow-up well
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
i'm just i would just
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
i mean no but i would suggest that i'm a
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
little bit confused by that because it
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
if that's the match ratio you could we
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
could do 50 000 general funds
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
get the 150 match and have the 200 000
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's really what my underlying
 
02:45:05.460 --> 02:45:05.470 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:06.790 align:start position:0%
question is
[Music]

02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you great and i i think the answer
 
02:45:10.950 --> 02:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
back from ms police is that it's
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
it is in fact an 800 000 project and the
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
200 000
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
is needed to get the match to support
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
the total project
 
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
and that this money is going to a vendor
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
who's maintaining the architecture and
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
doing the updates
 
02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
and expansions
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
maybe she could just speak to confirm
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
that that they really were
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
once 200 000 was in hb2 they would have
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
been able to match it
 
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
i would think that if the 200 000 was
 
02:45:43.359 --> 02:45:44.389 align:start position:0%
i would think that if the 200 000 was
budgeted

02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
um in-house bill 2 for us to uh add the
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
federal we would have had to go to
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:03.910 --> 02:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you have any questions uh
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative weiler you're you're
 
02:46:07.269 --> 02:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
you're you're sort of seeing this kind
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
of this detail for the first time oh i
 
02:46:11.269 --> 02:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
think i think keith was right we got to
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
show those 800 000 and that's the way
 
02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:13.510 align:start position:0%
show those 800 000 and that's the way
it's

02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
it makes some shortcuts we have any
 
02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:23.349 align:start position:0%
it makes some shortcuts we have any
other

02:46:23.349 --> 02:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
conversation around this um
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%

02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
because mr ripple and miss police just
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%

02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay do you have the
 
02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:51.760 align:start position:0%

deletes the section 38
 
02:46:54.160 --> 02:46:59.429 align:start position:0%
deletes the section 38

02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler that that 804
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
000 decrement in there for agency income
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
we asked about that earlier and and that
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
was a
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
a a small mistake in the draft process
 
02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
that ms klisch recognized and
 
02:49:23.110 --> 02:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
is taking the opportunity to just fix it
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes so so far this afternoon
 
02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
um i've noticed that we've been adding
 
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
um i've noticed that we've been adding
back

02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh expenses to that back um
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriations to the budget this is the
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
second one i mean obviously we just did
 
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
the county one
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
um i assume these are coming out of the
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
found 127.7 million dollars that
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
the chairman just spoke to us about and
 
02:50:04.469 --> 02:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
the hesitancy i have about voting even
 
02:50:08.309 --> 02:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
for this 200
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
um and i did i did vote for the county
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
cap because
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
i obviously um have been concerned about
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
that right along but i
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
my hesitancy is here's 200 000
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it's going to get the first
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's getting the first decision of house
 
02:50:27.670 --> 02:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill one
 
02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
how to spend this found money
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i i mean i guess i need to stack it
 
02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:34.950 align:start position:0%
and i i mean i guess i need to stack it
up

02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
against something else that might cost
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
200 million dollars that someone might
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that's that's sort of the dilemma
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm in we're now
 
02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
we're adding back money into the budget
 
02:50:54.230 --> 02:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
but we're doing it we're doing them in
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
isolation i haven't seen house bill one
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen what we're doing as a
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
total in house bill one
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
am i making myself clear is that oh i
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
think so
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh subsystem optimization was the word
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
they taught me in grad school
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
wow i've never heard that word before
 
02:51:13.110 --> 02:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's where i went to grad
 
02:51:13.120 --> 02:51:14.469 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's where i went to grad
school

02:51:14.469 --> 02:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
so so if you if you would be more
 
02:51:18.479 --> 02:51:19.830 align:start position:0%
so so if you if you would be more
comfortable

02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
holding off the vote on this hb1 change
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
until monday i i i
 
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think i would be fine with that uh our
 
02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:29.670 align:start position:0%
i think i would be fine with that uh our
goal

02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
goal
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
is is to lay out
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
a view of hb1 of the amendment
 
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
i would i would appreciate that because
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to see the full picture um
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
before i am i have already voted for the
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
county cap
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
um so i would like to see
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
a whole picture of how much money we are
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
adding back
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
into the bus budget and where
 
02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
i think that's a reasonable request and
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i i can hold off a vote until monday
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay did you say
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
something to representative weiler did
 
02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
you say yes i think yes i have
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion okay what would go go
 
02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay she's saying we're adding this back
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
in of 127
 
02:52:30.309 --> 02:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
million have you decided earlier in the
 
02:52:30.319 --> 02:52:31.030 align:start position:0%
million have you decided earlier in the
day

02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
to go with what the governor had in this
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
in this budget or if you're still
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
working from representative earth's
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
working papers
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
where we cut uh quite a bit of money out
 
02:52:42.469 --> 02:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
um hb1 hhs budget
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
have you added that all back everything
 
02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
that that we
 
02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
that representative thing took out if
 
02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
then we are adding new money but if we
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
if we're just still working from where
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
we started with a
 
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
big deduction then we're just still
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
adding back money that we had took it
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
away early
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think um technically the
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
the correct answer is that until we
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
got a ways and means update uh we were
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the same trajectory that we've been
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
on for the last week or two
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
assuming the ways and means estimate was
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
was the gold standard well i was
 
02:53:28.230 --> 02:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
i was uh misled when she said we're
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
adding back money from 127 million
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we still have started from a
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
different place
 
02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
than the governor was if i'm
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir to be fair we really hadn't i
 
02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.630 align:start position:0%
yes sir to be fair we really hadn't i
hadn't

02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
hadn't
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh clarified that uh in the morning i i
 
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've just been holding off for a ways
 
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
and means update and
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
i've just assumed that until we know
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise we
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
continue to do what we're doing unless
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
we know better
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
there was also some thought at the
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
meeting i was out of
 
02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
speeding up some tax cuts and using some
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the money that way so
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we'd be cautious about
 
02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:09.750 align:start position:0%
um you know we'd be cautious about
adding

02:54:09.750 --> 02:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
adding
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
anything back some of the things we've
 
02:54:13.590 --> 02:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
deducted already and and representative
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
earth found
 
02:54:15.990 --> 02:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
places in the budget that the governor
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
had spent less
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
than what the uh agency had put in so
 
02:54:23.990 --> 02:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
until we add it all up i don't know as
 
02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
we're adding more money to this budget
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
as it came to us or
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
still spending less thank you
 
02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes sir and while you're away one of the
 
02:54:35.030 --> 02:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
things that we
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
we did uh and we voted on and turned out
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
to be six to nothing so i
 
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't mind voting in your absence was
 
02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.870 align:start position:0%
i didn't mind voting in your absence was
um

02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
we we agreed that the department
 
02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
would use the same enhanced fmap
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
process or estimates that they had used
 
02:54:59.110 --> 02:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
for the primary medicaid account
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
and by using that same assumption on
 
02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:02.309 align:start position:0%
and by using that same assumption on
other

02:55:02.309 --> 02:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
medicaid accounts it added back
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
um or it was basically found money of
 
02:55:10.469 --> 02:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
about 12.5 million
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
so so even on the same trajectory we
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
were on with ways and means earlier
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
today we did
 
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
but um but but i think i think we're all
 
02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing that we shouldn't
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
vote on this one
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
item until we see the whole picture on
 
02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:34.309 align:start position:0%
item until we see the whole picture on
monday

02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative wallner i didn't mean to
 
02:55:38.150 --> 02:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt you did you no no no
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that that was exactly my point
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
um we have already we have already done
 
02:55:45.510 --> 02:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
that with the county cap
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
um but like you said we did have 12
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
um additional this morning so
 
02:55:56.230 --> 02:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
um you know that comes into the picture
 
02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:56.950 align:start position:0%
um you know that comes into the picture
too

02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that off maybe that balance maybe
 
02:56:00.469 --> 02:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
that helps balance out part of the
 
02:56:04.389 --> 02:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay so i think we have three more
 
02:56:08.230 --> 02:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
things to talk about
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to talk about the sununu
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
youth center and some
 
02:56:14.469 --> 02:56:14.479 align:start position:0%
some potential language questions like
 
02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
pardon me lots of hands lots of hands
 
02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren question or
 
02:56:22.399 --> 02:56:23.510 align:start position:0%

just to make sure that we're coming off
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the same base
 
02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
do you recall receiving my copies of the
 
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%

02:57:18.389 --> 02:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
the the i've i've sent some images
 
02:57:22.870 --> 02:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
of snips twice
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
but any case uh monday to answer your
 
02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:26.870 align:start position:0%
but any case uh monday to answer your
question

02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
is uh it's it's on the house calendar is
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
a as a work session
 
02:57:34.469 --> 02:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh i'm um i've got it down that we're
 
02:57:34.479 --> 02:57:35.830 align:start position:0%
uh i'm um i've got it down that we're
gonna

02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's the right term
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
for us but we're going to exact
 
02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
hp 254 hb 600
 
02:57:47.269 --> 02:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
um i've got
 
02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
section 19 hanging out there and we're
 
02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to add
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
section 34
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
to a discussion and maybe a vote on
 
02:57:58.080 --> 02:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
to a discussion and maybe a vote on
monday

02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
monday
 
02:58:03.510 --> 02:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
so sections 19 and 34
 
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
are still outstanding i think
 
02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an hb1 discussion in
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
votes and we're going to have an hb2
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
discussion in votes
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the idea on the hb1 and 2
 
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh and and this is this is where i don't
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
want to over commit mr ripple and i also
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
want to admit i'm not
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
exactly sure what this thing look is
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
going to look like
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm thinking that we may have
 
02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
something to review on monday that looks
 
02:58:32.880 --> 02:58:34.550 align:start position:0%
something to review on monday that looks
like

02:58:34.550 --> 02:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
division three's hb1
 
02:58:40.389 --> 02:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
amendment proposal and that we can
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
review it
 
02:58:44.710 --> 02:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
and look at the big picture and and see
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
where all the moving parts are
 
02:58:51.670 --> 02:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
that that's that's for monday and then
 
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
i have intentionally left tuesday
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
and wednesday unscheduled
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
in case we have crises and we need
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
we need to just push it you know keep
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
keep working for another day or two
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
but if everything goes great we could
 
02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
potentially be done monday
 
02:59:15.670 --> 02:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
or tuesday does that
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah
 
02:59:19.429 --> 02:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you and maybe
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
if representative weiler has any updates
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
on when he's going to do the
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
budget briefing that would be helpful
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
that determine representative weiler how
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the budget briefing to
 
02:59:34.150 --> 02:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
02:59:39.349 --> 02:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
preliminarily with the speaker
 
02:59:40.710 --> 02:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're having a three-day
 
02:59:42.469 --> 02:59:42.479 align:start position:0%
session on uh
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
seven eight and nine he's gotta make
 
02:59:46.630 --> 02:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
some arrangements but we tentatively
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
talked about the sixth of
 
02:59:50.230 --> 02:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
the uh tuesday before the three-day
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
session so it'll be
 
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
four-day four-day session
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be a zoom it would be an
 
03:00:02.150 --> 03:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
in person
 
03:00:06.309 --> 03:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
reaping on the ship yeah
 
03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
at the sports arena very likely
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes really well i i don't think they can
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
do a 400 person zoom yet
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
no i don't think i think they can excuse
 
03:00:18.479 --> 03:00:21.030 align:start position:0%
no i don't think i think they can excuse
me

03:00:21.030 --> 03:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:24.309 --> 03:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
so so that's outside of our divisions
 
03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility well so however
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
however he does it it'll likely to be
 
03:00:31.830 --> 03:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
so representative wallner your hand is
 
03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
up well i
 
03:00:38.230 --> 03:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
also wanted to ask um chairman weiler if
 
03:00:41.910 --> 03:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
um what day he thinks we will exec
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
the full committee will exact house bill
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
one and two
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
the 25th of march
 
03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
i better get those to janet so they can
 
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
make sure i make the calendar
 
03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative if your hand is up oh i'm
 
03:01:04.950 --> 03:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead representative
 
03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't the 25th of march
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
next week yeah yes
 
03:01:13.590 --> 03:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we have had to be in this
 
03:01:18.630 --> 03:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
trying to remember if i told her to put
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
it in there i i read that you got this
 
03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:24.070 align:start position:0%
it in there i i read that you got this
week

03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i didn't see it in there that's why
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay so it would be in house calendar 16
 
03:01:36.309 --> 03:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
which is the most current yeah last
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
night but i didn't
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
all right so so if you can
 
03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
mr ripple since you're so facile would
 
03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:48.550 align:start position:0%
mr ripple since you're so facile would
you

03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:01:51.030 --> 03:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
bring up house calendar 16 and take us
 
03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:52.070 align:start position:0%

march 20 25th
 
03:01:59.590 --> 03:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
25th i can do that i'll pull it up now i
 
03:02:01.269 --> 03:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
did confirm i looked through it last
 
03:02:03.030 --> 03:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
night and i did not see a full committee
 
03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
exec session schedule but i'll pull it
 
03:02:36.870 --> 03:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
there are currently division two and
 
03:02:40.790 --> 03:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
three work sessions scheduled but no
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
full committee exec
 
03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i guess at the time i
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
i think division one is finished but the
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
other two hadn't given me definite
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
my apology i i i've been trying to say
 
03:03:07.590 --> 03:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
the 24th of march
 
03:03:10.550 --> 03:03:10.560 align:start position:0%

the
 
03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
calendar on
 
03:03:35.190 --> 03:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:38.230 --> 03:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
friday the 26th
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
because as you note the calendar will
 
03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:41.760 align:start position:0%

03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right it will all right so
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
we agree in this in this division and i
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
get the other divisions to agree as well
 
03:03:56.389 --> 03:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
because i see karen had
 
03:04:00.150 --> 03:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
something on the 25th so i can tell you
 
03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
something on the 25th so i can tell you
that

03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking our work will be done
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
by then sir
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%

03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
into the calendar for next thursday
 
03:04:18.790 --> 03:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:27.750 --> 03:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative walter your hand is still
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you sorry representative
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
regarding uh representatives comments
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:04:46.469 --> 03:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
what we're voting on we already have
 
03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
voted on five of the different
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
accounts have a four or five or some
 
03:04:51.349 --> 03:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
number a couple days ago
 
03:04:52.710 --> 03:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
are we still waiting to vote on those
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
coming up i think it was like disability
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
and medicare and medicare
 
03:05:02.469 --> 03:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
whole exact session on friday
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
those let me try to answer that when
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
when we voted the 51 million ad back
 
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
for the medicaid and then you know 17
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
million for something else
 
03:05:17.030 --> 03:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
though those those were uh
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
to build our increment list
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
to where that that wasn't votes
 
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
to to definitively put it in hb one
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
no that's fine so we did i don't
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
recognize we did vote on that right
 
03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's all we had votes
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective what we were
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
voting on was
 
03:05:39.510 --> 03:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
our our increment list
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
which also works as a decrement list if
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
we were to take
 
03:05:46.230 --> 03:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
a cut so that's what i thought we were
 
03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:48.790 align:start position:0%
a cut so that's what i thought we were
doing

03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.510 --> 03:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i still would like to to
 
03:05:51.520 --> 03:05:52.389 align:start position:0%
okay so i still would like to to
introduce

03:05:52.389 --> 03:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
a conversation on uh the sununu youth
 
03:05:55.600 --> 03:05:56.550 align:start position:0%
a conversation on uh the sununu youth
center

03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
center
 
03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
a personnel hb2 and um
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
and just flash the forensic hospital
 
03:06:03.670 --> 03:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
right up
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh to make that's in your inbox but i
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to just get synced on on what i
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
think we're doing with that
 
03:06:14.469 --> 03:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
so so um mr ripple could you show
 
03:06:16.870 --> 03:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
that intent language i put together on
 
03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:18.469 align:start position:0%
that intent language i put together on
sysc

03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
03:06:18.479 --> 03:06:22.550 align:start position:0%
sysc
please

03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.110 --> 03:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
so so representative weiler we were
 
03:06:25.120 --> 03:06:26.469 align:start position:0%
so so representative weiler we were
talking

03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
talking
 
03:06:28.230 --> 03:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
gosh i don't know when that was was that
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
just yesterday maybe
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
and what i thought i heard you tell me
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
was that we wanted to um
 
03:06:39.910 --> 03:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
put something into hb2 dealing with
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
our thoughts around closure of the
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
so i drafted this language which
 
03:06:46.479 --> 03:06:47.990 align:start position:0%
so i drafted this language which
subsequently

03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently
 
03:06:50.309 --> 03:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
i ended up missing the that meeting with
 
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
mr dejoy
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
due to the my car clock being wrong
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
um but so so mr ripple
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
has talked to mr dejoy mr dejoy
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
i think was under the impression that
 
03:07:10.150 --> 03:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
our language coming out of our division
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be that we would shut the sununu
 
03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:14.710 align:start position:0%
would be that we would shut the sununu
center

03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
center
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of this by by the end of this
 
03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:18.389 align:start position:0%
at the end of this by by the end of this
biennium

03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
and and when i had considered this
 
03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:21.590 align:start position:0%
and and when i had considered this
language

03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:07:23.910 --> 03:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
that just felt to me too quick so this
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's why i wrote
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
it this way and and
 
03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that we have language to
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
review from mr
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
joy today but but i thought i would at
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
least show you
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
what i had been thinking uh and then you
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
can tell me
 
03:07:41.910 --> 03:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know forget this and we're going to
 
03:07:43.030 --> 03:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
go a different way
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
and this is the first well i although i
 
03:07:50.469 --> 03:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
emailed it
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
to a copy to you this is probably the
 
03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
first time you've had a chance to
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
can anyone hear me yeah i had it muted
 
03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:12.790 align:start position:0%
can anyone hear me yeah i had it muted
sorry

03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:08:17.030 --> 03:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry um my discussion with him
 
03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:18.469 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry um my discussion with him
was

03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
we think we can give them one year
 
03:08:26.550 --> 03:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
so it would be at the end of of uh 2022
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
which would be uh june of
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
june 30th 2022 rather than 2025
 
03:08:37.750 --> 03:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know and because it just keeps
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
dragging on and
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal report we looked at we
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
looked at that
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
earlier today there's a an audit out
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
which doesn't speak very well about the
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
synonymous senate it's
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's been released uh representative
 
03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
walmart i think has a copy
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i probably uh you do as well of the
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the audit and that along with
 
03:09:11.750 --> 03:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the the uh what i read in
 
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
the alvarez and marcel
 
03:09:18.790 --> 03:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
report uh it's just going downhill fast
 
03:09:23.190 --> 03:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
over there and so
 
03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
john dejoy felt that there was a
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
possibility of getting it done
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
within a year once we passed this budget
 
03:09:31.349 --> 03:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
they've got a year
 
03:09:34.630 --> 03:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
and he says most of the uh one of his
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
ideas was most of the
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
people there can go into alternativeness
 
03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's some that
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
need a little more security than others
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that can be done
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
in in a form that's done over in orford
 
03:09:49.590 --> 03:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
at the beckett uh company or beckett
 
03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
at the beckett uh company or beckett
organization

03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then if we put out a bid
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the county jails most of which have
 
03:09:56.640 --> 03:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
to the county jails most of which have
room

03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
room
 
03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
and sometimes an extra wing almost
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the one or two or three murderers
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
that we can't let out can be isolated in
 
03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:08.469 align:start position:0%
that we can't let out can be isolated in
a

03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:10:12.309 --> 03:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
jail and you know there's enough distant
 
03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
learning now and so on they can be given
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
they can be given education that way and
 
03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:19.269 align:start position:0%
they can be given education that way and
uh

03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know people can visit them as
 
03:10:22.870 --> 03:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists or whatever
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
but it is likely these people will age
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
out of the juvenile system and go right
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
into the
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
mature prison so
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any thought to let
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
them out so we don't need to go to any
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
halfway house for them but
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's so few of them that
 
03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
if we put out if we put out a rfp to all
 
03:10:45.190 --> 03:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure one would one or two would bid
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
on it
 
03:10:50.710 --> 03:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh i know rockingham county has extra
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
space so
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be the way to deal with
 
03:10:56.469 --> 03:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
with the handful
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
of murderers and uh
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
the rest could be dealt with with less
 
03:11:03.429 --> 03:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
thing and then we would
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh close the place down and there's some
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
thought to
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
either put it on the market or repurpose
 
03:11:11.990 --> 03:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
it somehow
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the things he mentioned was
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
in the state of new york cuomo went to a
 
03:11:20.790 --> 03:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
prison that was set up for
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
youthful offenders there were 200
 
03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:25.110 align:start position:0%
youthful offenders there were 200
employees

03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
there was this special prison with no
 
03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:28.469 align:start position:0%
there was this special prison with no
one

03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:11:31.750 --> 03:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
in it and again
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
he was more worried about employing of
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
200 people elsewhere in the state
 
03:11:39.670 --> 03:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
government so another thing that
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
was uh brought up by mr
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
de joy is that
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
if biden is out to forgive
 
03:11:54.469 --> 03:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
monies that the the federal government
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
put up to build youthful prisons with
 
03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that we need to
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want to keep the youthful
 
03:12:02.309 --> 03:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
prisons going just so we
 
03:12:03.670 --> 03:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay us back we'll
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
forgive the debt
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
which would would be a big help if we
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have to pay
 
03:12:11.030 --> 03:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
10 million back if we close it and stop
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
using it or we try to repurpose it
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
we try to sell it so that's a
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
possibility as well he felt
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
strongly so he thought we could save 10
 
03:12:22.630 --> 03:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
million within this biennium
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
if we have it closed by the second year
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
and it and with the talk we had i'm
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
sorry you missed it it went on for about
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense and he had numbers
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
and he showed me a spreadsheet
 
03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
so i was hoping that uh he would get
 
03:12:40.950 --> 03:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
together with mr ripple and we'd have an
 
03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:42.070 align:start position:0%
together with mr ripple and we'd have an
amendment

03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
has he contacted you mr ripple
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
yes he has i heard from him this morning
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
and he sent me a few
 
03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
i think it would be multiple amendments
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
and he sent me a few of those sections
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay so we could we could put them in my
 
03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
okay so we could we could put them in my
name

03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
name
 
03:12:59.590 --> 03:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
and present them because i have i've
 
03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:00.070 align:start position:0%
and present them because i have i've
discussed

03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
it with him and and told them that i
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
approve them and if he would send you
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
the language
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
which i looked at that i would be happy
 
03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay so so one task is the language you
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
see now
 
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't appear to provide any
 
03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
usefulness that we should just get rid
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
of this language
 
03:13:24.389 --> 03:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah it it would be like like mr ripple
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
said it'd be multiple
 
03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:28.469 align:start position:0%
said it'd be multiple
amendments

03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i was hoping that somewhere in there
 
03:13:32.469 --> 03:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
we could say that the grounds will be
 
03:13:34.950 --> 03:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
repurposed to provide an ongoing tax
 
03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
stream to the city and state
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
and potentially a one-time revenue
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
stream as well
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
well i think that's a good intent but i
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:13:45.269 --> 03:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we could put it in there it's it's
 
03:13:47.429 --> 03:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
like ten years ago i think
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative walden representative
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
northern probably remember ten
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
ten it was maybe 15 years ago we put
 
03:13:54.150 --> 03:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
laconia in
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
with similar language and here we are
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess it doesn't matter if we have
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
it in there and it doesn't so it doesn't
 
03:14:02.479 --> 03:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
it in there and it doesn't so it doesn't
matter

03:14:03.030 --> 03:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
matter
 
03:14:06.070 --> 03:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
okay so mr ripple we we can just uh
 
03:14:10.870 --> 03:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
we can just trash this language
 
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
so um representative edwards
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes this is mary jane um
 
03:14:21.990 --> 03:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree with the things that
 
03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:23.269 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree with the things that
um

03:14:23.269 --> 03:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler just um spoke about
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
i've been here for a long time and we've
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
been working on this sununu issue
 
03:14:35.190 --> 03:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
for a number of years um
 
03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it feels like we're going to have to
 
03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:39.190 align:start position:0%
and it feels like we're going to have to
set

03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
set
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
some pretty aggressive deadlines
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
or it's not going to happen yep it just
 
03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:47.590 align:start position:0%
or it's not going to happen yep it just
drags

03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
drags
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
um and it i think it's finally going to
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
take someone saying
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is the date we've got to work
 
03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
this is the date we've got to work
towards

03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
towards
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
this date and we have to have it done
 
03:15:01.750 --> 03:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
i guess the last several times i mean
 
03:15:04.830 --> 03:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
i've been on a number of bills
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
amendments everything imaginable and i
 
03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
i guess in some ways i guess we were
 
03:15:11.670 --> 03:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
just sort of like too nice
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
because we never actually said this is
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
the deadline
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that i think that time
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
that time has come yeah so just so you
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
know i i think experience is the best
 
03:15:28.469 --> 03:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
teacher and so i appreciate you sharing
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
your experience with me
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
on that um the the reason i was hesitant
 
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
to go with a
 
03:15:37.349 --> 03:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
quicker timeline is because i've heard a
 
03:15:39.190 --> 03:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
lot of concepts from
 
03:15:42.389 --> 03:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
some really smart dedicated people on
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to the kids that
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to be
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the sununu center if we like for
 
03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
example if we were
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
to agree to hb254 there's
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a demographic a set of
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
demographics of people that would no
 
03:15:56.800 --> 03:15:57.670 align:start position:0%
demographics of people that would no
longer

03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
longer
 
03:15:59.670 --> 03:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
go to the sununu center they would go
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere else well
 
03:16:04.630 --> 03:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
so far the somewhere else sounds like
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
concepts that that people haven't
 
03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
turned into capabilities yet and i don't
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
i haven't
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
seen a plan to go from concepts to
 
03:16:15.200 --> 03:16:16.710 align:start position:0%
seen a plan to go from concepts to
capabilities

03:16:16.710 --> 03:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
03:16:19.590 --> 03:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
and and so i'm just reluctant as a
 
03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
and and so i'm just reluctant as a
planner

03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
planner
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
to say okay all the kids out of the
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
sununu center on this date
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
without first knowing that there's a
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
place for them to go
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
and and if and and and if
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
and if it's just one of those chicken
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
and egg things where there's never going
 
03:16:39.190 --> 03:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
to be a place for them to go until we
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
say they gotta leave
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah then okay i can buy that but but
 
03:16:43.760 --> 03:16:44.309 align:start position:0%
yeah then okay i can buy that but but
that's

03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that's why i went with the later
 
03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:47.990 align:start position:0%
that that's why i went with the later
date

03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
date
 
03:16:51.510 --> 03:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
i do think that the system of care that
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
we started developing in the last budget
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
is going is already working on providing
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
a number of those kinds of
 
03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
of places that in a number of programs
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
i mean there there's a lot of things
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
going on around the country
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
um around keeping kids at home and being
 
03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
able to send
 
03:17:13.030 --> 03:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
services into families and trying to
 
03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:13.429 align:start position:0%
services into families and trying to
keep

03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
keep
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
kids in the place where we probably all
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
agree they should be
 
03:17:19.990 --> 03:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
and helping families take care of their
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
own their own kids so
 
03:17:24.630 --> 03:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of things going on and
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:17:29.910 --> 03:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
our since our numbers have gotten so low
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
we should be able to put this together
 
03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
in a year and have a pretty good plan
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
um i saw uh represent senator
 
03:17:44.790 --> 03:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
john dejoyce he was a representative at
 
03:17:45.750 --> 03:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
one point i
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
saw his um suggestion about the idea of
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
the county jails for those very serious
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
offenders um the youth would have to be
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
separated obviously from the adults
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
um but that was a suggestion i had not
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
seen before and i think it was
 
03:18:07.030 --> 03:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
really had some merit um it would be an
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
interesting because
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
those those young people were tried as
 
03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
adults and were probably
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
well will definitely go into the adult
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
system when they turn 18.
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i think kathy can probably tell me
 
03:18:21.990 --> 03:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
if i'm right or not
 
03:18:25.349 --> 03:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
because she's an attorney right she
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
used to work in this she works in this
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
field for a long time
 
03:18:33.190 --> 03:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
so uh representative nordron
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um and i was
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
thinking when we have this discussion
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
we should make sure that maura the
 
03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
child advocate is invited so she
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't come and participate
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what the discussions
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
have been with
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
but i think it'd be important to include
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
her when we have that on our agenda
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
thanks i agree i agree
 
03:19:01.349 --> 03:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
um okay so let's let's talk practicality
 
03:19:03.269 --> 03:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
here for a second
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
mr ripple um given where you're at and
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
what you have
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
when do you see the best case and worst
 
03:19:11.279 --> 03:19:11.830 align:start position:0%
when do you see the best case and worst
case

03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
for having hb2 language for us to look
 
03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
for having hb2 language for us to look
at

03:19:16.630 --> 03:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
well i have informal language that's
 
03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
been sent to me by
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
mr dejoy and he's about to send me three
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
more pieces
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
um i could
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
share that with the committee if if you
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
all would like me to
 
03:19:33.510 --> 03:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
as far as formal amendments from ols i
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
think we would end up giving it to them
 
03:19:36.550 --> 03:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
on monday morning and hopefully would
 
03:19:40.229 --> 03:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
have everything back by monday afternoon
 
03:19:42.790 --> 03:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to representative weiler on
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
the sharing of mr de joy's documents
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
i welcome it does that mean that we
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
should put it on the uh
 
03:19:54.389 --> 03:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
lba website because because i think
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's a related
 
03:19:59.670 --> 03:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
question well i don't
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know until it's informal language i
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
don't know is it
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a preliminary thing
 
03:20:08.550 --> 03:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
once we have a formal
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
amendment would be more appropriate
 
03:20:14.710 --> 03:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
but you know we could be an announcement
 
03:20:15.910 --> 03:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
you agree with that mr ripple based on
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
i i think it will be okay since the the
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
content that these amendments haven't
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
been discussed publicly or
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
anything like that i think it would be
 
03:20:31.590 --> 03:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
fine to wait until we have a formal
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
ols amendment all right thank you
 
03:20:38.630 --> 03:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
so so so the game plan is to send them
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
and and you'll start sending them off to
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
ols and hopefully we could know by
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
monday afternoon that's the best case
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
what do you think the worst case is
 
03:20:49.439 --> 03:20:51.349 align:start position:0%
what do you think the worst case is
tuesday

03:20:51.349 --> 03:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
03:20:53.590 --> 03:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
well i think if you i think if you're in
 
03:20:55.269 --> 03:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
agreement as to the language you want on
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
monday morning
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
then the worst case scenario probably is
 
03:20:58.560 --> 03:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
then the worst case scenario probably is
tuesday

03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.670 --> 03:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
let's let's use sysc first thing
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we do i had put hb 254 as the first
 
03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
that we do i had put hb 254 as the first
thing

03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we'd need to do 254 first and then
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then do syst
 
03:21:24.150 --> 03:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes ma'am mr chair um
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
254 actually
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
will have a lot it will be need to be
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
the language there is going to need to
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
probably i assume would have to be
 
03:21:36.080 --> 03:21:37.429 align:start position:0%
probably i assume would have to be
incorporated

03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
incorporated
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
into um the sununu amendment
 
03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
right um that that's a
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's an integral part of of making
 
03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:47.269 align:start position:0%
that's an integral part of of making
this

03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:21:50.950 --> 03:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
work so i i think you're right
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i think when i sat down last night
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
trying to do that myself i didn't know
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
how to do that
 
03:21:58.710 --> 03:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that that's why i wrote that little
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
intent paragraph instead
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
but uh so so mr ripple are you are you
 
03:22:03.760 --> 03:22:04.389 align:start position:0%
but uh so so mr ripple are you are you
also

03:22:04.389 --> 03:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that the two the key sections
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the 254 language
 
03:22:11.990 --> 03:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
need to find themselves into hp this hp2
 
03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.309 align:start position:0%
need to find themselves into hp this hp2
language

03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that they need to they
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
certainly could and i believe that may
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
be part of the
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
language that mr dejoy is going to
 
03:22:21.120 --> 03:22:24.150 align:start position:0%
language that mr dejoy is going to
provide

03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
all right mr representative weiler one
 
03:22:29.429 --> 03:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
of his suggestions was
 
03:22:33.110 --> 03:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
incorporate 254 and hb2 the language of
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
it and then
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
retain 254 so if something happens in
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
the process
 
03:22:39.990 --> 03:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
we'd still have that option to do
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
something with 254.
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
i think if we incorporate it in hb 2
 
03:22:47.830 --> 03:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
then when we come to the time for retain
 
03:22:49.030 --> 03:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
bills we probably won't have to do
 
03:22:49.990 --> 03:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
anything with it
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
assuming everything works the way we
 
03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:53.990 align:start position:0%
assuming everything works the way we
hope

03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
hope
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i think it's it's all of us support
 
03:22:55.920 --> 03:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
and i think it's it's all of us support
it

03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
so i think at this point we have a game
 
03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
plan are there any questions about what
 
03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
plan are there any questions about what
we're

03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:23:05.110 --> 03:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do over the weekend
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
on monday i'm not seeing any
 
03:23:12.229 --> 03:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
so there's two other topics uh and
 
03:23:15.750 --> 03:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
i i think we just need another 15
 
03:23:17.429 --> 03:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
minutes and we can adjourn it's been a
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
long day
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
um can you show the personnel
 
03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph that uh that you've drafted
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
why don't you talk us through this or
 
03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
maybe people just can read it for
 
03:23:42.830 --> 03:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
30 seconds and then you can talk us
 
03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i think most of you have read it and
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
i i just would want to
 
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh immediately just point out that the
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
100 and the 10 million
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
are are still in flux they're they're
 
03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:17.830 align:start position:0%
are are still in flux they're they're
tbd's

03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
tbd's
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
um i i didn't know what kind of uh
 
03:24:23.110 --> 03:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
guidance we were going to get coming
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
coming down
 
03:24:27.670 --> 03:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
so so so this was an area where i
 
03:24:27.680 --> 03:24:28.070 align:start position:0%
so so so this was an area where i
thought

03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
we might have a shock absorber depending
 
03:24:31.830 --> 03:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
on what we heard
 
03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
so that i think all the language here
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
is is is pretty useful but the hundred
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
ten million i think are still tbd
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to do you want to speak
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
to this now
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
mr ripple or did i just steal your
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
thunder no i i think you summarized
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
everything it's a 10 million dollar back
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the budget production that's
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
specific to personnel costs um
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
just to explain how the 10 million
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
dollars was arrived at
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
each on average positions in the
 
03:25:07.520 --> 03:25:08.229 align:start position:0%
each on average positions in the
department

03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
cost about 50 000 in general funds uh
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
between salary and benefits
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's an approximate number but i believe
 
03:25:17.190 --> 03:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
it is pretty close and
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
lastly there's a fiscal reporting
 
03:25:20.550 --> 03:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
requirement contained in here as well so
 
03:25:21.750 --> 03:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
the department would need to come into
 
03:25:23.190 --> 03:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal and identify
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
specifically where they've made those
 
03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
specifically where they've made those
reductions

03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
so now that i've just heard you say that
 
03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
is is this um is there any sort of
 
03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
i i hate to use the word enforcement in
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
this context but that's kind of where
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going is
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
what if they don't report what happens
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
they will i don't need to worry about
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
that it's not only a reporting
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
requirement they also need to provide to
 
03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:49.429 align:start position:0%
requirement they also need to provide to
das

03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
das
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
the exact accounting units and class
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
lines to be reduced and the section will
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
have the force of law so it will require
 
03:25:57.190 --> 03:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
them to reduce personnel related class
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
lines by this 10 million dollars so
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
everything contained in here has the
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
force of law so i'm i'm assuming the
 
03:26:04.710 --> 03:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
department will
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
is there a conversation questions
 
03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any yeah yeah
 
03:26:24.550 --> 03:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
do you have a question uh representative
 
03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
do you have a question uh representative
weiler

03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
just to comment that this is not
 
03:26:29.110 --> 03:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
untypical of what
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
all of us have seen before dealing with
 
03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
all of us have seen before dealing with
hhs

03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
more than any other department this is a
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
typical thing
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
when we get done with the other uh
 
03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
sununu youth center
 
03:26:45.190 --> 03:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
it may incorporate retraining
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
and and so on and relocation even for
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
the employees but that will be over and
 
03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:52.469 align:start position:0%
the employees but that will be over and
above

03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
above
 
03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
this and that will begin only happen
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
when the
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
sununu center is closed because i think
 
03:27:01.110 --> 03:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
they've got the about 200 employees
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
there and many of them
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
they want to go to work in in one of the
 
03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
like the glen hill or the
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital where they're
 
03:27:09.590 --> 03:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding people
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
so and if if they needed retraining or
 
03:27:15.190 --> 03:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
go back to school we might even work out
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
something in the
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the budget of closing the sununu
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
youth center i think there is something
 
03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
to do all of that so but this is not
 
03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
untypical of what we've done in the past
 
03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
with hhs and
 
03:27:30.550 --> 03:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
putting it back in the budget cut so
 
03:27:33.030 --> 03:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
they know how to deal with it thank you
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir i i think as far as numbers as i
 
03:27:38.070 --> 03:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
recall the sununu center
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
for some reason 116 is in my head
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
of how many uh authorizations they have
 
03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
of how many uh authorizations they have
and

03:27:44.870 --> 03:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
i could have sworn that whenever they
 
03:27:49.269 --> 03:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
talked to us they were talking about 96
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
people so
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
i think you're right i think it's i
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
any any 90s questions comments
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
so so i think we'll go to another place
 
03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:03.590 align:start position:0%
so so i think we'll go to another place
then

03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:28:05.590 --> 03:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
what's if you would pull up my language
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
on the forensic hospital
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then representative rogers i'm going
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
to ask you to
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
repeat for the public and the committee
 
03:28:16.150 --> 03:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
your your two
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
i sent this late last night and it was
 
03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
i sent this late last night and it was
uh

03:28:30.710 --> 03:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if everyone's had a
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it i've gotten
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
confirmation from representative rogers
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
and representative walner that they both
 
03:28:40.229 --> 03:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
looked at it and then
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative rogers do you want to do
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
you want to make your observations
 
03:28:46.710 --> 03:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
sure let me just go back and look at
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
them again now
 
03:28:51.190 --> 03:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
basically the first one was related to
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
the first bullet
 
03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
about uh you you prefer different
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
language to the town or municipal
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
museum municipalities and this is comes
 
03:29:00.160 --> 03:29:00.870 align:start position:0%
museum municipalities and this is comes
from

03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
experience being from concord and having
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
served on the council
 
03:29:06.630 --> 03:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
is that um instead of just saying
 
03:29:08.309 --> 03:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
municipal involvement
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that um i would like
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
to say that that it would be
 
03:29:12.479 --> 03:29:13.830 align:start position:0%
to say that that it would be
coordination

03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
um so that instead of just having them
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
talk to someone
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the public works department or
 
03:29:21.429 --> 03:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
something like that that they actually
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
do talk
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
to the the city or town manager or uh
 
03:29:26.950 --> 03:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the select board or the
 
03:29:26.960 --> 03:29:27.429 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the select board or the
mayor

03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
mayor
 
03:29:28.950 --> 03:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so that they're
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
they're talking to somebody in charge of
 
03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality
 
03:29:34.229 --> 03:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
and not talking to just one department
 
03:29:35.190 --> 03:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
head so
 
03:29:37.590 --> 03:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
quite often if you talk to a department
 
03:29:39.190 --> 03:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
head or a department employee it doesn't
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
work its way up
 
03:29:42.710 --> 03:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
to the mayor and the city council and so
 
03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
you don't get the policy leaders there
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
talking about it
 
03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that language
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
maybe say um
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
coordination or something or direct them
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
towards the policy leaders
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing is is i was
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we could
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
also ask for operational costs or an
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
operational plan because
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
where the the the project isn't going to
 
03:30:03.760 --> 03:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
where the the the project isn't going to
go

03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:30:07.190 --> 03:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
into operation in the time frame of this
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
i think that one of the questions we all
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
had this time around
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
and two years ago was um what what is
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
the operational plan of this facility
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
and what are the costs going to be
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
because that's obviously something that
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
while at night that's going into effect
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
now it will be in effect in the next
 
03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
now it will be in effect in the next
budget

03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
and is obviously a concern we have
 
03:30:30.630 --> 03:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
because you don't operate a 60-bed
 
03:30:32.550 --> 03:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
facility with no people
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
and if we have one amendment someplace
 
03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
else in house bill one or two
 
03:30:38.389 --> 03:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to be cutting a hundred staff
 
03:30:40.710 --> 03:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
people and then we have this
 
03:30:43.110 --> 03:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
how many staff people are we adding to
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
in fact make this operational
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think we we should have the right hand
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
knowing what the left hand is doing
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
um so i would like us to have something
 
03:30:53.349 --> 03:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
in here asking for when
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
they the various information is gathered
 
03:30:56.630 --> 03:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
that at least
 
03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
we are shown that they're thinking about
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
an operational plan for this
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
may i respond sure okay
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
so so once again i find ourselves in
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
violent agreement with one another
 
03:31:14.710 --> 03:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
oh my god first the first bullet
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
the the first bullet was my uh
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
late night attempt to to to get the
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
coordination and that you had mentioned
 
03:31:24.080 --> 03:31:24.469 align:start position:0%
coordination and that you had mentioned
and

03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:27.429 --> 03:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
and so uh so i think that first bullets
 
03:31:27.439 --> 03:31:27.830 align:start position:0%
and so uh so i think that first bullets
just

03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh begging to be um edited uh to your
 
03:31:35.190 --> 03:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
liking uh and then the last bullet on
 
03:31:37.269 --> 03:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
cost estimates will be included with a
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
target being plus or minus 15
 
03:31:43.190 --> 03:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
that that sort of was again my attempt
 
03:31:43.200 --> 03:31:43.510 align:start position:0%
that that sort of was again my attempt
to

03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
to get it what you're saying that we
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to understand what the annual
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
operational costs are are going to be so
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another place where
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're i think
 
03:31:56.790 --> 03:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
your thoughts find a
 
03:31:59.190 --> 03:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
foothold and we can just find the right
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
words there
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
i do have to say say that i did start
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
out by
 
03:32:05.190 --> 03:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
email and return to you saying that i
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
thought it was a superb plan
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i was thanking you for doing it so i
 
03:32:10.150 --> 03:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
do you
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
do that i i was going i was thinking
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
about making you say it publicly but
 
03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
well i should have i'm saying it now i i
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
do think it's a great start plan and
 
03:32:22.150 --> 03:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for doing it you're
 
03:32:23.190 --> 03:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
very welcome
 
03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so representative weiler you've had
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up
 
03:32:29.590 --> 03:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it's down now did you have a
 
03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
question or comment well i was going to
 
03:32:31.600 --> 03:32:32.389 align:start position:0%
question or comment well i was going to
ask

03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask representative rogers
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure concord has
 
03:32:40.229 --> 03:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
cities uh water and city sewer
 
03:32:43.269 --> 03:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
is that true yes it is so that would
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
that would be a big
 
03:32:48.070 --> 03:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
deal to be adding a 60-bed hospital
 
03:32:50.229 --> 03:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
where there's nothing now unless they
 
03:32:51.910 --> 03:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
knock down some other buildings
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that's you know that that
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
might have to go into the planning there
 
03:32:58.150 --> 03:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
might have to be additions or
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
a bigger water main or something like
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
that so that's the kind of thing why you
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
got to get involved with
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
municipality because you just can't
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
throw it up and then discover you don't
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
have enough water or enough sewage
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
so right those are those are important
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
considerations to be looked at
 
03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
and get some idea of the flow and so on
 
03:33:18.070 --> 03:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i just
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't understand what
 
03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
it just it just means we couldn't agree
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
any more completely
 
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
all right but i guess i'm also in
 
03:33:34.710 --> 03:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay i'll uh and and then uh
 
03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative wallard had emailed me
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
separately as well
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i think uh one of the takeaways i
 
03:33:45.190 --> 03:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
got from her
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
email was uh
 
03:33:51.750 --> 03:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to remind everyone that
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating getting a hearing
 
03:33:54.399 --> 03:33:55.910 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating getting a hearing
together

03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:33:59.110 --> 03:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
on the 12th of april and
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh with the point of talking about um
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
this issue and so if we if we kind of
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
like where this is going
 
03:34:09.269 --> 03:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
then i would start to encourage people
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
03:34:13.269 --> 03:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
who we might want to invite to get them
 
03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
to our hearing on the 12th of april
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
so um and and who knows after we hear
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
from people we might just
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
throw this out and start fresh but but
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
um all right uh representative waller
 
03:34:28.229 --> 03:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
did you have more to add
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.030 --> 03:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little i'm a little concerned
 
03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:43.590 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little i'm a little concerned
about

03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
um some of this
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
i i want to be sure that we hear from
 
03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
as you know this is sort of something i
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
always go to but
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
i want to be sure we hear from people
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
other than the department
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i think we pretty much know where
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
the department stands
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
i mean they want a 60-bed they want a
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
60-bed facility um
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
i would i'm really
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
wanting to know what would be
 
03:35:19.590 --> 03:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
a right size facility
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that i'm going i'm not
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
the department is the is the place where
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to find that out
 
03:35:29.830 --> 03:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you i think this is this is
 
03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
you know if you i think this is this is
fine

03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
fine
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
um but i i really really want to hear
 
03:35:40.309 --> 03:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
what um what others think
 
03:35:43.190 --> 03:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
i mean remember last two years ago this
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
was a big
 
03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
issue in the budget and we we ended up
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
passing something that said a 25 bed
 
03:35:51.439 --> 03:35:52.950 align:start position:0%
passing something that said a 25 bed
facility

03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and then in the senate
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
156 also says a 25
 
03:36:04.830 --> 03:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
bed facility so
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm concerned about
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
jumping right to the 60 bed facility and
 
03:36:12.560 --> 03:36:13.269 align:start position:0%
jumping right to the 60 bed facility and
they

03:36:13.269 --> 03:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we know that's what the department
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
wants at this point i'd like to hear
 
03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:18.479 align:start position:0%
other opinions so
 
03:36:20.710 --> 03:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
i really need more input than just the
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
department so
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i would just want to draw
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
your attention
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
to the places in this document where
 
03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's uh i've used the phrase 60 beds
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and all of them are qualified with
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
the term not to exceed
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
60 beds and you know and
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
and we're asking them to do research and
 
03:36:42.239 --> 03:36:43.590 align:start position:0%
and we're asking them to do research and
report

03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so so part of that i've i've tried
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
to anticipate
 
03:36:50.309 --> 03:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
that maybe if they really think about it
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
and start coming up with costs
 
03:36:54.150 --> 03:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
and coming up with project plans maybe
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
they'll want to come back and say ah
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
25 was the right number so so that's
 
03:37:01.269 --> 03:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
that's why i put a not to exceed into
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
this document
 
03:37:07.349 --> 03:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
thank you yes ma'am uh
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren you had your
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
hand up for a moment
 
03:37:18.630 --> 03:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
i do um so i was just going to suggest
 
03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know where the senate will be in
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
their discussions
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
if they already will have started
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the budget but
 
03:37:28.710 --> 03:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
it might be good to have somebody from
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
the senate finance committee come and
 
03:37:30.880 --> 03:37:31.750 align:start position:0%
the senate finance committee come and
join

03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
join
 
03:37:34.229 --> 03:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
us for the 12th if there anyone's
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes and then i think if um
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
i think sort of to to that point if uh
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
where i've talked about the distribution
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the report
 
03:37:53.670 --> 03:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh i i i made it up i said on the house
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
and senate respectively
 
03:37:59.030 --> 03:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna need uh the report to go to
 
03:37:59.040 --> 03:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
you're gonna need uh the report to go to
hhs

03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
ea public works and finance
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
and and i and i think those are the same
 
03:38:06.479 --> 03:38:07.429 align:start position:0%
and and i and i think those are the same
committees

03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
committees
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
that we should try to involve on the
 
03:38:10.840 --> 03:38:13.269 align:start position:0%
that we should try to involve on the
12th

03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
12th
 
03:38:17.110 --> 03:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
so um are there any other
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
comments or questions you take a look at
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
it the whole point of this document was
 
03:38:21.279 --> 03:38:22.070 align:start position:0%
it the whole point of this document was
really

03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
just to just to try to capture what i
 
03:38:25.990 --> 03:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
thought i was hearing people
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
saying and thinking and and um
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
so that we have some some way to focus
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing on the 12th
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
so um there's there's really no action
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
on this other than
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you think about it some more
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
and you want to send
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
me some replacement words or some
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
additional words i'd love that
 
03:38:52.950 --> 03:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
i i want to come back to just one more
 
03:38:52.960 --> 03:38:53.429 align:start position:0%
i i want to come back to just one more
thing

03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:38:56.070 --> 03:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
did mr ripple did we did we what did we
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
that was the laconia school was that in
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
our purview or out
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i was muted that's that was
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to division one
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay it's out all right so i think
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
um i think we did a lot today um
 
03:39:19.990 --> 03:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
did we forget something mr ripple on the
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think so you've done everything
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
okay well it's been a long day and and
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
people have been really
 
03:39:31.189 --> 03:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
um great so so thank you i
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
i think it people not been so great we'd
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
we'd be here until 10 o'clock so
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
enjoy your friday evening um
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
any are there any parting comments for
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
the good of the committee
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
sorry i missed so much oh you were busy
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
you brought in some some great
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
information well
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay so on that point will we be getting
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
something in writing
 
03:39:57.189 --> 03:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
or or or and i forget what you said
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
about whether or not we were going to
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
have a target
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like it now with this
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:11.189 --> 03:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you thank you go
 
03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you thank you go
ahead

03:40:14.550 --> 03:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am go ahead well
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
what does that mean it i mean i realize
 
03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
you probably won't
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
need to make the reductions that you had
 
03:40:24.880 --> 03:40:25.670 align:start position:0%
need to make the reductions that you had
had

03:40:25.670 --> 03:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:40:29.110 --> 03:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
had to previously because you filled in
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
the hole that was in between the
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
ways and means estimates and the
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
governor's estimate
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
but will division three be given
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
um a number of
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
new money that they can add to the
 
03:40:47.910 --> 03:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
budget the governor gave us that list of
 
03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:48.469 align:start position:0%
budget the governor gave us that list of
his

03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
his
 
03:40:51.150 --> 03:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
other priorities or um
 
03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:52.389 align:start position:0%
other priorities or um
[Music]

03:40:52.389 --> 03:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:40:56.550 --> 03:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
well from the chairman of the committee
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
yes you won't be given a target but i
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
still think
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
that from our interviews with the
 
03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
department heads and bureau chiefs and
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
all those that
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
they cannot get up to what the 2021
 
03:41:11.670 --> 03:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
budget was
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
so rather than have them have a lot of
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
money that probably is just going to
 
03:41:18.710 --> 03:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
not be spent and relapse because i think
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
from something the governor said the
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
other day
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
the lapses which were expected to be 76
 
03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:26.229 align:start position:0%
the lapses which were expected to be 76
million

03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
from this fiscal year may well go to
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
150 million so
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that is from hhs because
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
they just couldn't expand that fast so
 
03:41:38.710 --> 03:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
have them struggle to expand in these
 
03:41:42.389 --> 03:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
new areas
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
i i support this back of the budget cut
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
because and you know we we can restore
 
03:41:49.510 --> 03:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
much of it but if
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
if we knew more of the of the vacancies
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
and where they're having trouble filling
 
03:41:56.790 --> 03:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
agencies and bureaus
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
i would cut back the money to those
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
places rather than have them struggle to
 
03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:01.830 align:start position:0%
places rather than have them struggle to
find

03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
people and then have it only half filled
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
and still not doing half the job they
 
03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough people to do so
 
03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'd rather still stifle it a little bit
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
from from the growth because i think the
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
growth has naturally been stifled just
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of available people
 
03:42:21.429 --> 03:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
so rather tie up money there that will
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
likely lapse
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
i would still like to see us reduce that
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
budget a little bit
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
but not as much as we originally started
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
out so
 
03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
if we all look at there and see what the
 
03:42:35.189 --> 03:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
departments are and go back to uh
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative earth's
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
figures we might still find agencies
 
03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:41.750 align:start position:0%
figures we might still find agencies
that

03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't need as much money as as was put
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
in there because i don't think they can
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
spend it and the ones that have been
 
03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
newly created
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
without statutory authority i'm i'm a
 
03:42:53.670 --> 03:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
little bit wary of of them just deciding
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
what they think they need and just
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
putting money in it rather than
 
03:43:00.790 --> 03:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
looking for statutory authority so
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
i was not impressed with that i guess
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
they called it the health equity which
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
would have been refugee
 
03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
i didn't think we had that bigger
 
03:43:10.630 --> 03:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
refugee population that we needed to
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
spend so much money on it so
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
those are things i'm wondering about but
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
anything you know when we get together
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
and discuss it
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
great but you would probably find
 
03:43:25.189 --> 03:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
some of the things i found that you know
 
03:43:26.790 --> 03:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
they couldn't they couldn't expand as
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
fast as 24
 
03:43:31.830 --> 03:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
in one year so it's almost wasteful
 
03:43:31.840 --> 03:43:33.189 align:start position:0%
in one year so it's almost wasteful
spending

03:43:33.189 --> 03:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
spending
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
so a question i would have then um
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
if we are not if we're not going to be
 
03:43:39.359 --> 03:43:41.189 align:start position:0%
if we are not if we're not going to be
spending

03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
spending
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
more in the budget um
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
and and filling in up to the governor's
 
03:43:47.760 --> 03:43:48.870 align:start position:0%
and and filling in up to the governor's
level

03:43:48.870 --> 03:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
or doing some of the other things that
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
he brought in as his priorities
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to be doing that but
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have x this new revenue
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
how would we when will we see how that
 
03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
new revenue would be
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
would be um proposed to be used
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
well that's that's some of the
 
03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
discussions we had today
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
with the speaker the majority leader and
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
you know what what can we do to convince
 
03:44:16.399 --> 03:44:17.510 align:start position:0%
you know what what can we do to convince
people

03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
to pass this budget and you know
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
most of them are not impressed with
 
03:44:22.800 --> 03:44:24.550 align:start position:0%
most of them are not impressed with
these

03:44:24.550 --> 03:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:44:27.269 --> 03:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
new programs at hhs they're more
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
impressed with
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
what can we do to help property taxes
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing so
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of the money may go that way but
 
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out what
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
what's going to appeal to the widest
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
audience that they would vote for a
 
03:44:40.239 --> 03:44:41.269 align:start position:0%
audience that they would vote for a
budget

03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
and one of the kind of things that you
 
03:44:44.150 --> 03:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i have seen through the years that
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
people are demanding
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
like i went and looked at revenue
 
03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
sharing and realized
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
that was very outdated legislation
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
it and it has been suspended every year
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
since 99
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and most of the most of the the revenue
 
03:45:04.150 --> 03:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
sharing stuff was written in 1970
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
and it talked about taxes sharing
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
portions of taxes like the
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
taxes that have long since disappeared
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you know things like uh
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
stock you know where you put
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
put taxes on the stuff in stock and
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
trade and that kind of thing
 
03:45:24.550 --> 03:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
i read these taxes that were going to be
 
03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
shared in 1970 and they
 
03:45:28.389 --> 03:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
none of them exist anymore so i thought
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
but so
 
03:45:31.110 --> 03:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i gave up on that thought
 
03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
because the revenue sharing
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
apparatus is gone however there is some
 
03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
thought about
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
going uh they've also suspended remember
 
03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
we passed
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
laws saying they were to get 40 of meals
 
03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
and rooms
 
03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that's also been suspended in
 
03:45:46.640 --> 03:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
and that's also been suspended in
several

03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
several
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
budgets so maybe we would be able to put
 
03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
more money into the
 
03:45:53.910 --> 03:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms taxes that would go back
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
to towns
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
and hopefully would directly reflect
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
property taxes so
 
03:46:01.269 --> 03:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
and that that'd be popular i think with
 
03:46:01.279 --> 03:46:02.710 align:start position:0%
and that that'd be popular i think with
everybody

03:46:02.710 --> 03:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
so those are the things that were
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
discussed that
 
03:46:07.990 --> 03:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
might help pass a budget rather than
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
just keep building
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh more health and human services
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
services that
 
03:46:15.510 --> 03:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're not certain are called for one of
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
the things that we did hear
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
the most talk about in the in our talks
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
and some of it in the
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing transitional housing
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
you want transitional housing for people
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
coming out of drug treatment
 
03:46:29.040 --> 03:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
coming out of drug treatment
transitional

03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
housing for people coming out of the
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral health hospitals transitional
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
housing of people coming out of prison
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
so you know and none of this has been
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
addressed very seriously
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
and of course it would have to be
 
03:46:47.279 --> 03:46:48.830 align:start position:0%
and of course it would have to be
somewhere

03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
um where nobody would say not in my
 
03:46:51.279 --> 03:46:52.550 align:start position:0%
um where nobody would say not in my
backyard

03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things i brought up was you
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
know some of these shuttered
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
shopping centers if they're on a a busy
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
way fair
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
where the people could walk to a job and
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
you turn
 
03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
some of the portions of it into housing
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
then maybe that would work perfectly or
 
03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
then maybe that would work perfectly or
maybe

03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:47:10.710 --> 03:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
they'd be nearby enough other places to
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
get jobs so those some of the things i
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
was thinking of
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
and right away the governor said oh no
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
not not shopping centers but
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
they i think we've all seen some some uh
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
shuttered shopping centers around
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
they can be repurposed but anyway
 
03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
something just just some things we all
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
thought about kicked around
 
03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
but anyway i hope we all do the same
 
03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:36.630 align:start position:0%
but anyway i hope we all do the same
great

03:47:36.630 --> 03:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:47:39.349 --> 03:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and so will we see these will
 
03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
we see some of these proposals
 
03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
on monday or tuesday i don't think
 
03:47:46.150 --> 03:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
they're fleshed out that fire yet and
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
and going to have a meeting again i
 
03:47:49.269 --> 03:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
think on tuesday
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh because the the uh
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
ways and means are going to come back
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
with some more numbers
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
and so representative
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that that we
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
really need as division three
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
to to be moving towards a vote and
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
that we i i was hoping i know it was an
 
03:48:13.110 --> 03:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
aspirational hope but i was hoping that
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
we could actually
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
vote on an hb1 amendment on monday
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
if mr ripple can pull a rabbit out of
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
his hat and get it produced
 
03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
and and and he can't even start until
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
this weekend so he is his sunday
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh is has been
 
03:48:37.189 --> 03:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
claimed this is time sunday
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
so are we i just want to verify
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
the division three's plan to have
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
discussions on our version of the hb1
 
03:48:50.309 --> 03:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
that we're on track for doing it monday
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
is my goal representative nordgren has
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
her hand
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
yes sir i was i was just looking for an
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of my question
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're so we're on track for for money i
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
would support yes
 
03:49:08.229 --> 03:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay so representative norden your hand
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
is up
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah a couple of things i would just
 
03:49:11.920 --> 03:49:13.189 align:start position:0%
yeah a couple of things i would just
remind

03:49:13.189 --> 03:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
remind
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
people that the last budget put a lot of
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
money into education funding
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
which was a huge tax cut for many
 
03:49:22.560 --> 03:49:23.670 align:start position:0%
which was a huge tax cut for many
communities

03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:49:25.910 --> 03:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that's not included in the
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
um i would also comment that
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
i don't consider this last year a normal
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
year for spending or anything else with
 
03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:38.150 align:start position:0%
year for spending or anything else with
coleman

03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
coleman
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think obviously health human services
 
03:49:43.990 --> 03:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
did lapse money but i think some of it
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
could have had to do with the fact that
 
03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
their staff was otherwise occupied with
 
03:49:49.830 --> 03:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
the crisis
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then i i wanted a little more
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
clarification on
 
03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
what uh the democrats on the committee
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
could expect
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
on monday are you just going to bring in
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
a budget for us to
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
look at already prepared or
 
03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
what do you plan to represent us on
 
03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:10.150 align:start position:0%
what do you plan to represent us on
monday

03:50:10.150 --> 03:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
monday
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a great question and
 
03:50:14.469 --> 03:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity to ask me
 
03:50:17.510 --> 03:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
or for me to ask you what the standard
 
03:50:17.520 --> 03:50:18.630 align:start position:0%
or for me to ask you what the standard
is

03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
how how did how was the democrat
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
proposal presented to the republicans
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
because if that's the standard please
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
tell me so that i can meet that standard
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
well we already did meet that standard i
 
03:50:34.080 --> 03:50:34.630 align:start position:0%
well we already did meet that standard i
mean

03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
so we went line by line and so
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
we ended up there it wasn't a democratic
 
03:50:43.990 --> 03:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
budget we did it all together
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
and and we presented it to the full
 
03:50:48.389 --> 03:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
so this wasn't just a democrat budget
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
and we gave it to the republicans we
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
worked every day
 
03:50:58.150 --> 03:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
line by line every page of the budget
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
in the end we agreed or we didn't agree
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
but then that division three was brought
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:51:08.550 --> 03:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
full committee of finance
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
so we've already not taken all those
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
steps so i guess that's what i'm
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify and what to expect on
 
03:51:16.319 --> 03:51:20.229 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify and what to expect on
monday

03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
i i think what we're going to present to
 
03:51:23.830 --> 03:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
you on monday is
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh a draft amendment or maybe an actual
 
03:51:30.150 --> 03:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb1
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.030 --> 03:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
i would i would hope that you would have
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
an overnight to look at it
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
i i i that's probably a reasonable
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
request and depending on how
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
how things go um
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know we i i'm trying to schedule
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
things really intensely today
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
and on monday and we've left tuesday and
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
wednesday blank
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
so we do have a little bit of flex in
 
03:52:05.520 --> 03:52:06.469 align:start position:0%
so we do have a little bit of flex in
here

03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
but but i'm i'm i'm trying to keep it on
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
us on an aspirational schedule and and
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
then we've got some
 
03:52:22.389 --> 03:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative yes this is really a this
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of a question for kevin and
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe he won't maybe he doesn't maybe
 
03:52:33.030 --> 03:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
he won't want to answer it or
 
03:52:36.870 --> 03:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how it would work but
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
if this is going to be an amendment
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
that changes house bill
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
one i mean i assume it will
 
03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
add some add some funds and some lines
 
03:52:52.389 --> 03:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
and take away some funds and other lines
 
03:52:52.399 --> 03:52:53.189 align:start position:0%
and take away some funds and other lines
and

03:52:53.189 --> 03:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
it's up and down will we be seeing an
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
03:53:01.830 --> 03:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the entire house bill
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
one i mean the whole the whole document
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
with all the ups and downs i wouldn't
 
03:53:10.630 --> 03:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
ask him to do that i
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
i think we're focused on the division
 
03:53:15.269 --> 03:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
three mission of dhhs and the veterans
 
03:53:15.279 --> 03:53:16.469 align:start position:0%
three mission of dhhs and the veterans
home

03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know that
 
03:53:22.150 --> 03:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
on on on monday we need to be bringing
 
03:53:24.150 --> 03:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
in division one and division two
 
03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
i i i that that sounds odd to me
 
03:53:30.150 --> 03:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
no did i say something i say something
 
03:53:31.990 --> 03:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
about division one and two i'm sorry
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
would i i may have misunderstood you my
 
03:53:34.720 --> 03:53:35.670 align:start position:0%
would i i may have misunderstood you my
apologies

03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm really trying to understand is
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
what kind of a document
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
will we receive will it be
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
the division three which is
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
health and human services will it be
 
03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
that budget
 
03:53:54.469 --> 03:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
with lines that go up or down i mean
 
03:53:54.479 --> 03:53:54.950 align:start position:0%
with lines that go up or down i mean
because

03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
if you take money away from some general
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
funds you're going to lose some federal
 
03:53:58.239 --> 03:53:58.950 align:start position:0%
funds you're going to lose some federal
funds

03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:54:00.630 --> 03:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i i don't know what you have in
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
mind and so will we see the whole
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
health and human service budget with a
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
with adjustments
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
on different lines or will we just see
 
03:54:14.710 --> 03:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
some sort of a piece of paper that
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
outlines where additions and
 
03:54:20.630 --> 03:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
subtractions are happening
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
does mr mr ripple do you understand what
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to say
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
i i do understand and i think it ends i
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
think it depends on what the final
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
proposal ends up being so i'm not sure
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
what it'll look like at this point
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we could and we could end up
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
with a very large document
 
03:54:44.309 --> 03:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
is that right i mean if it's the whole
 
03:54:44.319 --> 03:54:45.429 align:start position:0%
is that right i mean if it's the whole
budget

03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:54:49.990 --> 03:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
that that potential exists um but i
 
03:54:54.150 --> 03:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
think it really depends on what's
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
hashed out over the weekend i'm still
 
03:54:57.910 --> 03:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
not sure at this point
 
03:54:59.750 --> 03:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
what that will be or what the resulting
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendments will look like
 
03:55:04.229 --> 03:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
i think we've eliminated 100 pages
 
03:55:05.590 --> 03:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
through uh
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
all federally funded or all other funded
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that's almost half the pages in in
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
that section
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's a couple hundred pages there so
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
this you know those are the ones we're
 
03:55:16.630 --> 03:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
gonna have to revisit again
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
and there's others ones we already
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
looked at and added back almost to the
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
full amount
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so that took out another i don't
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
know 12
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
pages or so there isn't very many left
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
03:55:31.590 --> 03:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't expect to see much
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
changes unless we can find out vacancies
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of reluctant to give us
 
03:55:36.319 --> 03:55:37.510 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of reluctant to give us
those

03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:55:40.229 --> 03:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler i i do have a
 
03:55:40.239 --> 03:55:41.189 align:start position:0%
so representative weiler i i do have a
document

03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:55:44.550 --> 03:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
dated 11 march or or the data is
 
03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:45.269 align:start position:0%
dated 11 march or or the data is
effective

03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
on 11th of march i'll i'll i'll share it
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
with you where they've
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
listed vacancies and and kevin i
 
03:55:57.189 --> 03:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know the right name for the
 
03:55:57.199 --> 03:55:57.830 align:start position:0%
i don't know the right name for the
level

03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:56:00.150 --> 03:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
that they've given it to me at there's
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's those are
 
03:56:04.469 --> 03:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
there's about 14 or 15 items
 
03:56:06.630 --> 03:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
what what level is that is that called a
 
03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
department or what is that
 
03:56:09.750 --> 03:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if those were at the
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
division level they might have been a
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
um some some were at the division level
 
03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
and some look like they were at the
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
bureau level
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
so i i do have some data it's not line
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
by line by any all right
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
but that that'll be a big help
 
03:56:31.120 --> 03:56:33.910 align:start position:0%
but that that'll be a big help
representative

03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:36.070 --> 03:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
well i guess i would just say i'm pretty
 
03:56:36.080 --> 03:56:37.269 align:start position:0%
well i guess i would just say i'm pretty
despondent

03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
despondent
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
because never before has one
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
party ever spent the weekend coming up
 
03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
with a budget to present to the other
 
03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:47.269 align:start position:0%
with a budget to present to the other
party

03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
party
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative weiler knows that that's
 
03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
not how we've ever done things
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
i've been presented before in
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
one division the chairman did all the
 
03:56:59.760 --> 03:57:00.870 align:start position:0%
one division the chairman did all the
work

03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
and presented it to us so here we go
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
so things are done differently all the
 
03:57:07.199 --> 03:57:08.150 align:start position:0%
so things are done differently all the
time

03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.150 --> 03:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
i guess uh it's happy hour somewhere
 
03:57:25.670 --> 03:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
so so so maybe we should go find it
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh i i think uh i think we've talked
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
through this
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
and um we're uh we're getting ready to
 
03:57:34.469 --> 03:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
adjourn is there any
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
last thing before we we adjourn for the
 
03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:38.309 align:start position:0%
last thing before we we adjourn for the
weekend

03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
03:57:40.469 --> 03:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
and officially we'll see each other
 
03:57:44.070 --> 03:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
again 9 30 on monday morning
 
03:57:50.870 --> 03:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.880 --> 03:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
