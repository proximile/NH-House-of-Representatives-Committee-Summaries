committee uh dealing with with housing
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
issues my name is represent my name is
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob Lynn uh I represent
 
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh Rockingham District 17 that's the
 
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
town of Windam uh New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
here in support of HB 60 um this bill if
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
I I think I have my facts correct on
 
00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
this I believe this bill um has passed
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
the house three times now um uh over the
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
last two or four years I don't know I
 
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number but I'm I'm
 
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
pretty sure I'm right that it's passed
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
the house three times now and I hope it
 
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
will pass again this time this is a bill
 
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
that basically I mean we could if we had
 
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
to label this we could um label it I
 
00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
suppose a contract means what it says uh
 
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
bill um I think if you asked members of
 
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.590 align:start position:0%
bill um I think if you asked members of
the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
public if you have a lease for a year
 
00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
what's the term of the lease they would
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
say very naturally a year but under our
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
current law that is not the case if
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with restricted what's
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
called restricted property and I I think
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
restricted rest that restrictive
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
property does not mean that you are a
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
large landlord and you own you know
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds or or what or thousands of
 
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
units you can be the owner of
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
restrictive property if you own a 2unit
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
apartment a duplex that you don't live
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
in in other words you live in one house
 
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
and you have another duplex it can be as
 
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
small as that that's that would
 
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
constitute restricted property so it can
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
apply to a number of very small
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
landlords and under the law under a
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
under a Supreme Court decision from 2005
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I have to
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
emphasize that that was long before I
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
was ever a member of the Supreme Court
 
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
um there's a there was a case called
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
diesel witz
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh vers versus uh some company I don't
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
remember the name off hand um but
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
basically um what that Court decision
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
said is that if uh if you have a lease
 
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
for a term of a year and the year is
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
up you the tenant can simply say I'm you
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
know i' I want to leave I'm I'm the
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
lease is over I'm leaving and that's it
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing you as a landlord
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
can do about that nor nor should you as
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
the landlord be able to do anything
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
about that you signed a Year's contract
 
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's over it's over but from the
 
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
landlord's perspective the landlord
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
cannot evict you simply because the
 
00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
lease is over that does not under the
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
Court's reasoning in that case that does
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
not constitute good
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
cause so to be let me make sure to be
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
completely fair if you don't pay the
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
rent of course you can be evicted even
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
you know not whether it's a year or not
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
if you don't pay the rent of course you
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
can be evicted if you're if you um are
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
disruptive or you damage the property or
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
um various other reasons sure that would
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
be good cause but Simply Having the
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
lease end does not constitute good cause
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
and I submit that that just is is sort
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
of a flagrant affront to basic contract
 
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
principles and more importantly I think
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that there are there's a practical
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
implication to this
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
what it means and if you read the
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
Court's majority decision um the
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
majority really sort of Embraces this
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
reasoning if you read the Court's
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
decision what it says is that you know
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
tenants are fungible they're just from a
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
if you have restricted property the only
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
thing you should worry about is like
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
getting your money and not and the
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
property not being damaged and other
 
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
than that you know it's one one tenant
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
is fungible with another and it
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
particularly says and I can't quote I
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
can't remember to quote the language but
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
it particularly says that landlords
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
ought to make the decision as as to
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to have this
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
tenant essentially for the Long Hall at
 
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.110 align:start position:0%
tenant essentially for the Long Hall at
the

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
beginning because and I guess under this
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
under what I think is the kind of
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
convoluted reasoning of the court in
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
that case um be because they're going to
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
say if you make once you make that
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
decision Vision the tenant is there I
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
mean as Justice Netto pointed out in a
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
in a uh really I think very U pre and
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
concurring opinion the result of the
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
Court's decision is that once you let a
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
ten once you make a lease with a tenant
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
the tenant is there for Life unless the
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
tenant does something else that's a
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
basis for removing the tenant it's not
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
enough that the lease is over so stop
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
and think about this the implications of
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
this you are a
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
landlord and you've got to decide about
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
whether you want somebody to be a
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
tenant suppose you have somebody uh you
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
know sort of a a a marginalized a person
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
that you might that might be considered
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
a marginalized person in the sense that
 
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they have a bad credit rating um
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
or maybe they have um some kind of a
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
minor criminal record or something that
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know as a landlord well do I want
 
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
this person or not so stop and think if
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
if you're a landlord and you have the
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
right to have a lease for a year mean a
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
year you might say all right you know
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
got some questions about this person um
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
but it's only a year I'll I I'm willing
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
to take the chance for a year and if
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
things don't work out the at the end of
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
the year I'm just going to say I'm not
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
renewing the lease but and so you may be
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
persuaded I'm going to I'm going to take
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
my CH a chance on this tenant but if as
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
the law is now you allow that person to
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
come in you're stuck with that person
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
literally forever now if you know if the
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
if the per if you can prove that the
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
person did something wrong and you know
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh um and it's serious enough sure maybe
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
you can get him out for that reason but
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
it's not enough but you as the landlord
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
are going to know I'm going to have to
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
jump through all these hoops if if if I
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
think that this person might be you know
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
might be a drug user of some kind I
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
better be able to get evidence that's
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
going to be able to prove that and you
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
know will will other tenants be be
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
willing to to testify will I have some
 
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
evidence or will they be afraid um you
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
you have to factor in all of those kind
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
of things it just doesn't make any sense
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
and I submit that it really has the
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
effect of reducing the availability of
 
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
housing to PE perhaps people that should
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
be most um would find it most hard
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise to get housing um so I hope U
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
for all those reasons that this
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee will look favorably on this
 
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh and I'm happy to answer um any
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions that uh members of the
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony are
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
there any questions for representative
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
Lyn representative Holland
 
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:28.120 align:start position:0%
Holland thank you Mr chair is there
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
anything in state law that requires the
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
tenant to provide notification to the
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
landlord that they're not going to renew
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
the lease there's like a timeline or is
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
that just in the lease itself I mean
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
unless it I I don't think there is if
 
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's if it's you know if the if you have
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
a lease that says a year um I think you
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
know I I could be I stand to be
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
corrected but I don't think that that's
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
that you need to do I mean maybe the
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
least would say you know you're going to
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
give 30 days notice or something before
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
the but if it doesn't say that I don't I
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
don't think there is but I could be
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
correct I could stand to be corrected on
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
that can I ask a followup on that so so
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
I I think um the the issue here really
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
is because you mentioned it in your
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that you really as the
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
landlord what you really want is
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
stability because you want the rent to
 
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
come in because you probably have a
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
mortgage on the building and and your
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
bank is going to be want your their
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
money as well and so the issue really
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
here is in the notification part you're
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
saying that that the the individual once
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
they get in there they're going to be
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
there forever and the landlord can't
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
make a change but by so so right now the
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
the tenant doesn't have to tell the
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
landlord at least we think until the end
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
of the lease whether they're going to
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
renew so that adds to instability to the
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
landlord but the landlord may not want
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
the tenant and so and and there's cause
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
you mention it in terms of eviction why
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
they could get rid of it but it would
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
seem two months seems a little bit harsh
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of like the time frame and so
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
my my question really is it's hard
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
during the first year of the lease but
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
during the second year of the lease the
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
the tenant would have a one-year record
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
where they've adequately paid the rent
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't done it broken anything
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
terrible in the apartment and so
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be mindful to have a clause
 
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
in there that the renewal came up say
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
maybe in the second year of of his lease
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
six months in that he'd had adequate
 
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
time to to if they didn't want to renew
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
the lease or the landlord didn't want to
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
renew the lease that there was enough
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
time for the tenant to react because a
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the marginalized groups that you
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
met you talked about they don't
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative can you just finish up
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
your question please I'm sorry was that
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
enough of a question about length of
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
notification yes you know what you you
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
actually I I representative I thank you
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
for that question because you you
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
actually raised a very good point that I
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
neglected to mention last year this bill
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
as as presented last year had a 30-day
 
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
not period when the bill got to the
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
Senate um I believe it was Senator inis
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
who raised the issue of well wouldn't it
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
be better to increase the notice to for
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
for example I believe he suggested 60
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
days and so I and I said at the time you
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
know that that that makes sense to me
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
and so as I introduced the bill they
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
still Senate still didn't pass the bill
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
by the way but nonetheless um but I I
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
thought that that made sense and I
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
increased it I should also um uh
 
00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:29.790 align:start position:0%
increased it I should also um uh
indicate

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
that I've had um discussions with um
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
with um another witness who's going to
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
testify here repres uh OT uh Barry from
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
who a longtime uh and very good attorney
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
with with New Hampshire legal assistance
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
um about the the you know would it he
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
had suggested among other things um
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to increase right
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
now you'll notice the bill says uh that
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
that it applies to a lease of 6 months
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
or more or a tency of 6 months or more
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
he raised the question um would it you
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
know would there be uh some flexibility
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
and obviously this bill is in the
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee it's not it's no longer my
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill it's it's for the committee's
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
decision but um would there be some
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
willingness or at least on on my part as
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
a spon as a prime sponsor to consider um
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
extending that six-month period to a
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
one-year period and candidly from
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
speaking just for myself and I
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
understand the committee may have
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
different views but um speaking just for
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
myself I that would you know that would
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
be if if that would gets support from a
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
significant number of people who who
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
right now don't support the bill I that
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
would be a compromise that personally I
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
would be willing to make understanding
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have a completely
 
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
different view on
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
that I'll set representative
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
keran thank you chair um so just to
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
understand does this Bill enable a
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
tenant to be evicted without cause um
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
based on the expiration of the lease
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
even if that tenant had remained in the
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
residents with permission from the
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
landlord for years after the lease has
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
expired would if yes if the Le in other
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
words I think under current law if for
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
example let's say you have a year's
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
lease and the the year end the year ends
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
and the landlord doesn't you know both
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
sides want it to continue under the
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
under the law the that is converted into
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month tency um basically so
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
and and it can go on as long as both
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
parties want it to this bill would say
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
that after you know if if the landlord
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't evict it doesn't ask the tenant
 
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
to leave after the one-year period um
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
the 60 days would still apply the
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
landlord could by giving 60 days notice
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
um have the tenant
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
leave follow up yes please um would you
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
object to the addition to the bill that
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
requires the court to seal the record of
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
an eviction um based solely on the
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
lease um well you know I don't I mean I
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm I guess what I would say
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
is I I'm not sure that I would because
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
for for for this reason it seems to me
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the the whole idea of this bill is
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
to say that a contract means what it
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
says so if if you have that theory if
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a leas for a
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
year doesn't shouldn't that mean that
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
both parties who having signed that
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
lease have the expectation that at the
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
end of the year the the lease is over
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
and that either party can can you know
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
end it and so if the if in your example
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
the tenant decides I'm not going to I'm
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
not going to honor the contract I'm
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to force the landlord to evict me
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
to go to court to evict me you know
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe if that's something a future
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
landlord should know that you know
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
this because when the leases you know
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
both sides should be bound by
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
contract right any other questions for

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
axman
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
so mik in your initial testimony you
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
alluded to
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh the willingness of people to invest
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
in real estate and my question is sort
 
00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:36.990 align:start position:0%
in real estate and my question is sort
of

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
twofold have you looked at who owns
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
rental properties in New Hampshire my
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
research says that the vast majority of
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
rental properties in New Hampshire are
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
owned by Mom and Pops by small
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
investors and my experience is that many
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
people who have owned rental properties
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
Mom and Pops for lack of a better term
 
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.789 align:start position:0%
Mom and Pops for lack of a better term
uh

00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
and are increasingly hesitant to invest
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
in rental properties and own them
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
because of the difficulty of terminating
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
Tendencies and the the primary area that
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
I've I've seen this has been with the
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
fact that the end of a lease is not the
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
end of a lease have you looked at that
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
have you got any experience with that or
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
is what are your thoughts on that
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
well in in terms of if if you're asking
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
have I done sort of Empirical research
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
on that no I have I have not done
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
Empirical research on that um uh I think
 
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
I I think that um landlords would and I
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
I and I you know again haven't done
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Empirical research but I have no reason
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
to to doubt your your statement that you
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
know most rental properties in New
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are owned by sort of the mom
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
and pop uh kind of people I have no
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
doubt about that and I and I do know
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
that it you know
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
getting getting a tenant to leave that
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to leave whether it's
 
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
because of the end of the lease or they
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
haven't paid the rent or whatever that's
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
you're you're right that is you know
 
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:19.559 align:start position:0%
that is a hassle and and
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
um this isn't going to be a Panacea
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
passing this bill isn't going to be a
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
Panacea for ending that but I think it
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
does it does help it does move the ball
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
in the right Direction um and so um I I
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
hope again that's why I hope you'll pass
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
it okay um representative um
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
Miner thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr lynon I apologize if you've
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
answered this in some way and I might
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
have missed it but if this the contract
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
ends at the end of the
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
lease and then now there other co uh
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
just month-to-month tenant as at the end
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
of a lease and you've decided I don't
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
need to evict them or they don't need to
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
leave and I'm going to keep them because
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
they've been great right so after the
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
end of the term of the lease now that
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
they're month-to-month
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
tenants you still can't well can you use
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
the expiration of the lease and just
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
have them leave say no I'm tired of it
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
or will they still have to be evicted
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
for other cause now at this point as a
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tenant well well under
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
under if this law were to pass
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
um you you would be able then to give
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
the 60-day note in other words Once the
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
lease is up under under current law they
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
become month to- month tenants but under
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
current law as per that case you can't
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
evict them um just because you know
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're month-to-month tenants
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
they they're they're basically entitled
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
to stay theoretically forever um under
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass um you would have
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
to they're month-to-month tenants but
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
you would have to give 60 days notice so
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
you would have to allow them to stay for
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
2 months um you know you'd have to give
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
them notice that they before you could
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
uh evict
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
them thank you representative
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for coming to
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
testify this morning um just uh this is
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
basically a follow up to the question
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
that was asked by my colleague on the
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
other side of the room um and just for
 
00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:32.919 align:start position:0%
clarification um based on this bill if I
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
have been living in a rental unit for 7
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
years and I've paid my rent on time
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
every month and I've never damaged the
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
unit or bothered the other tenants or
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
annoyed anybody um and the lease has
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
expired but the landlord has been happy
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
to have me say since I was a good tenant
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
that at after 7even years the landlord
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
could evict me with 60 days notice and I
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
have to tell you this actually happened
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
to me so I haven't I haven't made this
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
story up um So based on this bill after
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
7even years of being a good tenant I
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
evicted uh that's correct and I guess
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that that I I
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's a harsh result
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll say that for this
 
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.430 align:start position:0%
and I'll say that for this
reason

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
my my belief you know I I actually W I
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually was a landlord back in the
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
1980s I owned one two two uh one duplex
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
but since I've not i' so but I haven't I
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
sold it in the late 80s have never been
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
a landlord since then so I have no skin
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
in the game for landlords um but
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is and I think it's
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very you know uh uh
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
worthwhile business uh something that we
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
need but that landlords are basically in
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
the business of investing in real estate
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
and renting properties because because
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
they want they want to make a a living
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
at that they want to they want to make
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
money at and so what I would say is if
 
00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:07.470 align:start position:0%
money at and so what I would say is if
that's

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
true it it strikes me that it would be a
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
very unusual situation for a landlord to
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
decide to evict a tenant just you know
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
well I you know by flipping a coin I
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
think today I'm going to evict this
 
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
tenant or that there there normally is
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
some reason for that
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
um and you know again I you know if
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're saying it it could it could there
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
have been only a really bad reason in
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
your case I I maybe I'm not saying that
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
that never happens but all I am what I
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
am saying is that it strikes me that
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
that it's not a big problem of landlord
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
sort of you know just arbitrarily on a
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
whim deciding to get rid of somebody
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
because for the very reasons that your
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
that your colleague pointed out it's a
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
hassle to get somebody out and then to
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
get somebody in the landlord is almost
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
always going to lose some money so
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
presumably they don't want to do that
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
unless they feel they have a good reason
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
it may I just make a follow-up Point
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
real quick is it a question or is it a
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
point it's a point all right this is a
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing I'm going to ask you to
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
only ask questions to the the witnesses
 
00:25:25.389 --> 00:25:25.399 align:start position:0%
please representative
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
here so I think I'm I'm sympathetic to a
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
lot of your arguments and where I'm
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
struggling is in the Practical effect on
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
the ground today when we have
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
effectively a 0% vacancy rate and I'm
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
thinking about my own
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
community so what I'm struggling with is
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
what happens to these tenants when they
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
are evicted without cause in this
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
particular Market um my question to you
 
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.190 align:start position:0%
particular Market um my question to you
is

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
what do you see that practical reality
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
looking like where do you see these
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
tenants going and do you think that
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
passing this bill will further
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
exacerbate our huge homelessness crisis
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
that we have in this state you know I I
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
this uh I I thank you for the question
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
and I I I guess the short answer is I
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
don't see that because you know if you
 
00:26:23.789 --> 00:26:23.799 align:start position:0%
stop and think about you know I know
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
that that's been an argument in fact I
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
think that apparently it had some
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
persuasive effect with at least enough
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate to but I think if
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
you stop and analyze look at this
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
analytically let's assume and I agree
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
with you that you know there's a very
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
low vacancy rate I mean there's no
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
question that there there's housing
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
shortage but let's let's take it even
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
further let's assume that there was no
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate there was absolutely zero
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate the argument that this is
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to somehow increase homelessness I
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
think doesn't really with stand
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
analytical scrutiny because it basically
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
is a one in and one out situation if you
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
assume that that there's absolutely no
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and that you know everybody
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
that is that is not in a rental property
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
is homeless then even if you assumed
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
that this would increase the number of
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
evictions and and you know candidly
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps it would to some extent but even
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
if you assume that that's true okay so
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
you have one person who is newly
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
homeless that person in with No Vacancy
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
rate is replaced by somebody who now
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
become who was homeless and now becomes
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
un homeless and so it it seems to me you
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
know if you logically now if you know if
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
you logically carry that through there's
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
no even in a you know not perfect No
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
Vacancy rate there's no reason to
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
believe that it's any more likely
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
that someone who is evicted will become
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
homeless than there is to to believe
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
that somebody who becomes a new tenant
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't come from the homeless I mean I
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
I I just think it you know it's a it's a
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
nice talking point for people who oppose
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
the bill but I think if you look at it
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
hold okay seeing no further questions
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lyn thank you
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
okay so we have um over 20 people um
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
looking to testify so I'm going to ask
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
everybody to keep their testimony at two
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to ask the uh Vice
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
chair to keep track of that for me um
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%

uh 25 which is W five in Manchester and
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
um by my Reckoning at least half of the
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
people probably more of the people who
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
are my constituents are renters um in
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um approximately
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
151,000 uh people are renters or there
 
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.990 align:start position:0%
151,000 uh people are renters or there
are

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
151,000 renter households I've sent out
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
two um uh pieces of paper one is my
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
testimony the notes for my testimony the
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
other one is from the national uh
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
low-income housing Coalition um which
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
has some data about um the um uh
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
availability of of housing in the state
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
um and um I also emailed my testimony to
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
you because there are some links and I
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
wanted you to have them live so you can
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
just look at their um research
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
um as as was reported the vacancy rate
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
in the state now is 6% and a healthy r u
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is considered about 5% um
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
half of all the households renter
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
households in New Hampshire are cost
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
burden which means that they are
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
spending more than 30% of their income
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
on housing over 30,000 of those
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
households are severely cost burdened
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
which means they are spending 50% or
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
more of their income on housing I spoke
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
to an um a retired person who is
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
spending six 60% of her income on
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
housing and um she's on social security
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
so she doesn't have a lot to spare
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
um most of the people um who are
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
severely cost burdened 64% of them um
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
are of the people who are severely cost
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
burden um make both less than $30,000 a
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
year and they rely on social security or
 
00:30:57.519 --> 00:30:58.750 align:start position:0%
year and they rely on social security or
suppl

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
suppl
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
security income for their um for their
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
income landlords require prospective
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
tenants to demonstrate that their
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
monthly income is representative I'm
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to wrap up if you can
 
00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
please okay um if this bill is passed
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
this will create chaos um there will the
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
people who are being forced out of their
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
housing um will be uh sent out into a
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
market that they cannot afford most of
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
these people are paying more than they
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
can afford on rent they they're hanging
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
on by a thread and uh they don't have
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
the money to move they don't have the
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
money for security deposits so I'm
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
asking you not to cut that thread um and
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
I am open to questions thank you very
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
lease agreements should lease agreements
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
have terms that Define the length of the
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
agreement at all should they even be in
 
00:31:58.399 --> 00:31:59.110 align:start position:0%
agreement at all should they even be in
the

00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
lease um well uh leases do protect
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
tenants from you know increases in rent
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
um I spoke to a woman who at the end of
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
the her lease saw her rent go up 650 per
 
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:14.919 align:start position:0%
or $650 a month so she has was at that
 
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
time looking for a second job in order
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
to keep that apartment because she can't
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for another one um yes so I I
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
agree that aase is a good thing I think
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
at this point in time with the housing
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
crisis we have and homelessness crisis
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we have which was has been a a big
 
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.710 align:start position:0%
that we have which was has been a a big
um

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
um a big issue um in the last election I
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think that now is a very good
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
time for us to be ending 40 Years of
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
protections for
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
renters um in order to you know make
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
contract law more more consistent in the
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
state we're talking about the human cost
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
here there are going to be a lot lot of
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
people that are going to be forced to
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
move some of them are going to be
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
um some of them are going to be homeless
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
some of them are going to move in with
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
their families others are going to quit
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
their jobs and leave the state and so
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
that is the ground truth that is what is
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
likely to happen if we pass this Bill
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reed thank you
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative um
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
we heard just now in previous testimony
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
that ostensibly this would not add to
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
our fast in the nation homelessness uh
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
growth rate um in your
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
expertise would you say that a person
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
coming out of homelessness to attempt to
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
rent has working against them the fact
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
that they are homeless and in other
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
words a market that is heavily skewed
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
towards landlords and landlords have
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
their pick of any tenant they want they
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
are unlikely to give a homeless person
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
or person coming out of home
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness that unit and in addition
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
if a person has been evicted that makes
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
it all the harder for them to get
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
housing yes that's that's true I would
 
00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
agree and and furthermore I would say
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
that you know the cost of of moving and
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of getting a new apartment you
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
know uh the average cost of a
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment in New Hampshire
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
is $1,800 a month um to prove you make
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
three times that would mean that you
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
would need to prove that you make
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
$5,400 a month
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
you have to have that first month's rent
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
you have to have um a security deposit
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
which is usually the same as a first
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
month's rent and um you need a moving
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
costs um you know you may have had uh um
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
um your furniture and storage um and in
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
general one of the things that um we're
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
seeing with people with homelessness is
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
that they they have other issues you
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
know they have mental health issues they
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
have and those and and or they
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities there are people that
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
cannot work and make enough money to
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
satisfy landlords and it's a landlord's
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
Market because of the vacancy rate being
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
so low people are building more houses
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
that takes years between permitting
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
construction and then you know getting
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
people into into houses and many of the
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
houses being built in Manchester are
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
renting for $3,000 a month you get
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
kicked out of a $1,200 a month apartment
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to rent a $33,000 a
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
month um one-bedroom apartment on on on
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
Canal Street for $3,000 a month that's
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
just not going to
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
happen see no other questions thank you
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative all right thank you next
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%

00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
welcome oh um representative stop if oh
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
oh no if they have I'll talk to you
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
about that go ahead Senator um good
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh the housing committee um my name is
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
Tara Reen I am the senator from district
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
15 representing Bo conquered and
 
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton I'm a former practicing
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
attorney and a large part of my business
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
was representing landlords I have done
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of evictions over the course of
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
my career and I was never at a loss to
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
find a cause for that eviction not only
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
the list in 540 uh colon 2 Roman 2 um is
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
there but the other good cause um is a
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
very broad excuse for um evicting
 
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
somebody and we never came upon um uh an
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
eviction that um couldn't be done for
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
some reason uh I will also note there's
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
nothing in a statute anywhere that
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
limits raising the rent and sometimes
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is a landlord's way of evicting
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
somebody is that um that huge rent
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
increase that they know that they can't
 
00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:04.910 align:start position:0%
increase that they know that they can't
uh

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
afford um I will say um that housing is
 
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
such a crisis nowadays it's the very
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
reason this committee is has been formed
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
and is sitting here um there is um such
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
a dir of Housing and I and over my last
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
10 years of my career I worked at the
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Community Loan Fund with
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income uh tenants and I
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
will say yes if they are evicted and
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
they're very low income they are going
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
to be homeless I guarantee you they're
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
going to join the um the uh roles of the
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
homeless so housing is extremely
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
critical at this point what else happens
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
when housing is lost is the per where
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
that person lives and their whole
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
support Circle disappears with that when
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
they leave that location um their
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors that help them watch their
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
children maybe the schools that their
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
children's go to the ride share that
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
they do to get to their job so a loss of
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
housing for a low moderate income person
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
is um is more than just housing
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes Senator I'm going to ask you
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
to wrap up if you could absolutely thank
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
you um so I would say that letting
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
tenants remain in their housing if
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
there's no legitimate good cause is the
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
fair and Equitable thing to do and it's
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
easy to dehumanize it and say it's it's
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
a matter of contract law and I suggest
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
that maybe we revisit this topic in 5
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
years orever how many years it is that
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rate is at 5% um instead of
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
under 1% as it is now thank you Mr
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you senator for your
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions representative
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
buolo yes um I have a question so you
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned something very interesting
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
which is that under good cause a
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
landlord for economic reasons could
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
raise the rent and then use that as
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
presumably something to push the tenant
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
out or um to to end the lease otherwise
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
um if term expiration was a uh good
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
cause to end a lease wouldn't that then
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
stop the perverse incentive of landlords
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
having to raise the rent to get rid of a
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
tenant and they could just say because
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
the lease is over I I I think I I think
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
what you say has logic to it certainly
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
but there's uh landlords do lots of
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
things that aren't increasing the rent
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
they say they're going to remodel the
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
apartment and when the tenant moves out
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
they they paint a wall and that's the
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
remodel and they rent it to somebody
 
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
else so landlords find ways around this
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
now um without uh there's the the the
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
part of it at the end of the expiration
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
is there's no judicial involvement at
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
that point it's the landlord telling you
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
that your um your lease is up that
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to leave so we will never
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
get eyes on if there are not legitimate
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay see any other questions thank you
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you next up I'm going to
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm state
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative hope Damon I serve half
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
of Sullivan County I won't list my nine
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
towns takes a while um I am also a
 
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
former landlord sort of in another life
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
decades ago my husband and I owned an
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
old in that we converted to apartments
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
and had cottages and we had nine units
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
for a number of years um I'm here to
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to the bill
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
primarily because new law is supposed to
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
solve a problem or have a purpose and I
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
don't see what problem this is
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
solving the law is very clear in 540 col
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
2 all the rules or rather all the
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
reasons why tency can be terminated
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
including the other good cause statement
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not clear to me what legitimate
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
reason a landlord would have for
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
terminating a tenant that is not
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
included in that statute
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
already and therefore reading between
 
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
the lines I wonder what not so
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason would be covered by
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
statute the current vacancy rate for
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
rental properties in New Hampshire is 8%
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
% it has been below 1% for The Last 5
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
Years 5% is considered a balanced Market
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
we need to keep people in their homes as
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
Senator re noted in their Community
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
where it works for them so that we have
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
them as
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
employees as parents as people that we
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
serve so I won't take more of your time
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
except to say I simply don't see the
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you thank you
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative questions for
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you parenthetically I
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate all your work I enjoyed being
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
on this committee last year thank you
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
for being a former
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
Holland good morning thank you for
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
having me I'm Sarah Holland um I am a
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
realtor and I am currently the the chair
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
of public policy for the New Hampshire
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors I am here to
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
show our support for this bill um and I
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
will make this short and I will submit
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
my written testimony um but the
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
important thing to note about this bill
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
is that no matter which way this goes
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not going to solve the housing
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
crisis um it is simply going to provide
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
more certainty for both both sides both
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants to understand the
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
terms of their agreement and their
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
relationship that they entered into it
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
provides guard rails it provides notice
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
um and the current interpretation of the
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
law as previously um noted here today
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't take into account the
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
landlord's property rights and how they
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
use their property and the important
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
life changes that they may also be going
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
through um they may have signed up to
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
take on a tenant um for a year or two in
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
order to you know maybe dabble in it to
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
provide um opportunities in their
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
Community um but maybe they go through a
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
life change and this is not something
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
that they can take on for life um and
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
they need a way to get out for a lack of
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
a better phrasing um representative
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
Thaxton notic noted earlier that Mom and
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
Pop landlords and this interpretation
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't you if they're not bringing more
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
units online because they are afraid of
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
getting tied into these leases and a
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
legal battle that they're also not in in
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
um anticipating um as taking on as a cop
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
so there was most recently an article I
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
think it was last week and I'm happy to
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
send that along to you that contractors
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
and other folks who are looking to bring
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
to convert units from commercial to
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
residential and make rental units more
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
widely available that they're not able
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
to get through that zoning approval
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
process so there are other ways that we
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
can look at this to provide more housing
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
for a lot of folks um however you know
 
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
providing more notice and transparency
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
for both parties of a of a rental
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
transaction um is is not the way to
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
solve housing so we support this Bill
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
00:44:32.599 --> 00:44:34.549 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
representative

00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you for your testimony thank
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just seeking clarification
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
on sort of the the case you're you
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
provided of somebody who gets into being
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
a landlord for a couple years and they
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
want out so so my my understanding is
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
that if they want out and they decide
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
that they want to stop running this
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
property that that is good cause under
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
existing statute am I wrong about that
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
what kind of getting out are you talking
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
about what are you your imaginary case
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
study here yeah it's not necessarily
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
imaginary right so there are a lot of
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
folks who who get into this and for a
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons including the legal
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
implications and having to take somebody
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
who who they have had a relationship
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
with over the years to court in order to
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
vacate that property
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
um that's a reason for folks to number
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
one not get into offering run
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
widely available um or to have them um
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
pull back and maybe open their rental
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
units up to other members of their
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
family or um to other folks who are are
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
deserving in other ways for variety
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's many different reasons why this
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
could happen um but just a a property
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
owner changing their mind about how they
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
wish to use their property they
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go through a legal
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
process in order to do
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
so representative Reed thank you Mr
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you taking my question you
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
said one of the um benefits to this was
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
the introduction of certainty for both
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
parties and I think we can all
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
understand easily how the certainty on
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the part of the landlord is beneficial
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
for the landlord the landlord has
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
complete control over that situation
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
after the um expiration of the lease um
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
can you please explain to me considering
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
there are far more renters in the state
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
than landlords how the certainty that
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
you will lose housing at the end of that
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
contract contract as opposed to the
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
certainty that as long as you continue
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
to pay your rent on time continue to be
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
a good tenant uh that you will keep your
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
housing how is the certainty that you
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
are going to lose your housing
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the vast majority of
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
people who are tenants and also the
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
workers that we desperately need in this
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
state sure thank you for that and I
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a very divisive
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
issue um and I have clients that are on
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
both sides of this so I definitely
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
understand and empathize um however as a
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
as a property owner um you should have
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
the right to decide how to as a
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental property right dispose of
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
your property and being able to provide
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
notice based on the terms of a lease a
 
00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:11.079 align:start position:0%
contract that you signed with that
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
tenant that explains the terms of that
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
agreement you're just providing them
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
notice that yes I agree that at the
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of this lease term we have we
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
have given ourselves 12 months to be
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
able to have this Arrangement and we
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
know I know longer wish you to be in my
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
property that that gives them at least a
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
small amount of time I understand that
 
00:47:38.109 --> 00:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
for some and in this housing situation
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
not the most appropriate amount of time
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes given the availability of
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
property um in rentals
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
that there is transparency that the
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
lease is what it says it is and I think
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
every tenant should go into that lease
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
under understanding what those terms are
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
and if they don't like them to advocate
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
for something that makes sense for them
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
so I again you know I understand that
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
this is divisive but this is relative to
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
a private property right and those
 
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.630 align:start position:0%
a private property right and those
property

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
owners are who we are representing at
 
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:14.910 align:start position:0%
owners are who we are representing at
this

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
moment quickly please thank you I
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate you appreciating that it's
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
divisive that that was not my question I
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
don't think I heard the answer to my
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
question which is how does this help
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
people who currently because of our law
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
go into that contract with the
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
understanding that they will have
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
security afterwards how is the certainty
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
that they will not have that housing um
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
something that's beneficial to tenants
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
the benefit to tenants is the
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
question the contract as it is written
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
and the terms of that contract should be
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
what the tenants should be understanding
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
and reading there should be no unless
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
the lease States and it's previously
 
00:48:56.359 --> 00:48:57.390 align:start position:0%
the lease States and it's previously
agreed

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
that they can stay over then they should
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
not have that expectation that they can
 
00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:04.430 align:start position:0%
not have that expectation that they can
stay

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
stay
 
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.910 align:start position:0%
stay
over

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
Grant can you tell me if a tenant
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
decides they don't want to leave how
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
long it takes to get that tenant out of
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
that apartment or whatever and how much
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
does it cost to the landlord
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
so it does take quite a bit of time so
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
the end so when an eviction process has
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
begun it can take um several months to a
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
year and possibly longer depending on
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
how that judge um receiving that case
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
decides to accommodate that tenant and
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
may require or allow them to stay in
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
that unit um for additional an
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
additional time period so the there are
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh metrics associated with this
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
but it is a large cost in time and money
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
eviction thank you represent
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
Paige this may have been a better
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
question for Senator Reen but following
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
up on rep Grant's question do you have
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
an an estimate of sort of a typical cost
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
for going through that proceeding I I
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
don't it ranges from Court filing fees
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
um which um could be you know under 100
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
to you know hundreds of dollars um plus
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
the survey as well as the time and and
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes lost rent as well because a
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
tenant may not continue to pay rent at
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
during those that process and I'm sure
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
there's um other people willing to speak
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
to that as well representa so um thank
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
you um Victoria Mark
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
welcome you just turned it off there hi
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
my name is Victoria maritz um I live in
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm originally from the Lakes
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
Region but I left for school and moved
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
back for uh for work um I live in a
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
studio apartment in Manchester and um it
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
took me four months to find that
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
apartment um this December a couple
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
months ago my heat and hot water were
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
out for most of the month um and I
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
complained to my landlord about it and I
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
started searching for another apartment
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe wouldn't have those issues um
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
but of course I couldn't find one um
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
because there aren't other apartments
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
and now with this with this law
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
potentially going through I'm scared
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
that my landlord will end my uh lease in
 
00:51:53.069 --> 00:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
March because I've complained about
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues to find someone who
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
who is willing to put up with those
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
issues given the current housing market
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
um even with the generous 60 days notice
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
with this law it's still it took me four
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
months to find this apartment it's
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
likely going to take me the the same to
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
find another if I can find one um and it
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
just feels like I if I'm evicted or if
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
my lease ends and and my landlord
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't want me to stay my mom and pop
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
landlord doesn't want me to stay then I
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
will likely have to leave the state like
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
most of my my siblings and most of my
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
friends have people my age to
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
neighboring states that are easier to
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
rent in um and I just feel like that the
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
just cause eviction law was put into
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
place to override this you know issue
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
that everyone is talking about about
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
leases being a contract because the
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
landlords have so much more power than
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
the tenants especially I mean they have
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
the privilege to own property and they
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
also and especially in this housing
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
market have so many more options than
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
tenants to
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
um to replace to replace someone when
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
when they don't to put someone into
 
00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.150 align:start position:0%
when they don't to put someone into
their

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
housing thank thank you very much any
 
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
Norman and I know you asked for five
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could keep it to two
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Alexander I

there's so much to talk about I'll talk
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
about as much as we can and the time
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%

advising on housing
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
issues so there's several things about
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
this to consider um I do agree it should
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
be balanced between landlord and tenant
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
contract uh housing providers absolutely
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
do not want to evict it's a measure of
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
absolute Last Resort it's fairly painful
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
to evict it's expensive it's time
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
consuming you end up with an apartment
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
that has to be renovated before it can
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
be um put back on the market so there's
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
no rash of evictions that I can possibly
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
foresee If This Were to pass uh however
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
there are times when it is very
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to evict someone that is
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
causing uh an issue that not non-paying
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the rent if you're attempting to
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
evict someone let's say that's uh a
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
disturbance um Dam um causing harm to
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
other people or threats to other people
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
that say or someone that's dealing drugs
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh there's a number of reasons why you
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
would want to evict somebody that's just
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
become a nightmare of a tenant and all
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
of those have to be proven in court um
 
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
so there are reasons that you can evict
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
but there they're many times just
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
impossible to prove so having this
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
provision would be good and I do think
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
it would be beneficial to people that
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
are marginally qualified tenants I know
 
00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:50.839 align:start position:0%
landlords that have marginally qualified
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
Tenants come to them and say I'd love to
 
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
take a risk on this person but if I'm
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
going to be stuck for for life you know
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to take the risk Mr Norman
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
I ask that you wrap up if you could okay
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
well there's there's so much more I've
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
been in the business for 35 years I have
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
48 units I have some experience I I open
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
to questions and and do please read
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
through all the testimony there's a lot
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
more to be said Thank you any questions
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%

could it's Cara Anne rhen Heiser
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
sorry um dear chairman Alexander and
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity this morning to address
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 60 um as I mentioned my name
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
is Cara rodenhiser and I'm the director
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
of the home forall Coalition and I'm
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of the coalition to
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
voice our strong opposition to this bill
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
and underscore the significant harm it
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
would cause renters and communities
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire the bill threatens
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
to destabilize housing security for many
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
renters permitting landlords to evict
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who have lived in their
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
homes for 6 months without providing any
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
reason it opens doors to arbitrary and
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
unjust evictions leaving families
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to sudden displacement and
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
creating a pervasive climate of fear and
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
uncertainty for renters but particularly
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
those who are low-income or in
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities the
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
consequences could be incredibly
 
00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.670 align:start position:0%
consequences could be incredibly
devastating

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
devastating
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
including increased risk of homelessness
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
and economic instability which are two
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
issues New Hampshire is already
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
struggling to address furthermore
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
eliminating good cause predictions
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
undermines Decades of progress in Fair
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
Housing and anti-discrimination efforts
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
when landlords aren't required to
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
provide a reason for eviction it becomes
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
far easier to conceal discriminatory
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
practices targeting individuals based on
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
race disability family status or other
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
protected characteristics
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
Beyond those legal concerns the bill
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
threatens stability of entire
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
communities severing vital connections
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
to Schools jobs and essential services
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
and this bill is not really about
 
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
creating fairness or ensuring landlords
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
have adequate tools to address problem
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
tenants these tools already exist and
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
are utilized when necessary data from
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
Institute has shown that eviction
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
filings in the state have uh risen 66%
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
between 2020 and 2023 uh returning to
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels these numbers
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that landlords already have
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
sufficient mechanisms to pursue eviction
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
when it is warranted what landlords need
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
are stronger support systems to ensure
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
successful ten tencies not legislation
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
that further erodes housing stability
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you wrap up okay and so
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's been noted that this bill has been
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
defeated uh several times over the past
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
year for good reason uh lawmakers have
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
recognized harmit poses and introducing
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
this bill again during a historic
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
housing crisis is deeply misguided um so
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of home forall I urge you to
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh consider opposing House Bill 60 and
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
work towards solutions that strengthen
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
our communities rather than weaken them
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Paige thank
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um so we heard from a uh prior
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
speaker who was concerned who was a
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
tenant who was concerned concerned about
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
having complained about maintenance
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
issues in their
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
apartment um so if this bill should pass
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
that tenant could be evicted without
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
cause at the end of their lease period
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
right if this bill should pass does that
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
person then have any recourse if they
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
feel they've been retaliated against
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
for making a VI a legitimate complaint
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
about their living conditions in their
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
building so I am not a legal exper
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
expert but I will say in my experience
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh working with landlords um as part of
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
my role uh with home forall uh that is
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that um tenants uh there's a
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
power differential landlords hold a lot
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
of power and tenants um are often afraid
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
to go to their landlord with um concerns
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
even something as simple as not having
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
heat um in their unit already because
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
they want to have a positive
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
relationship with their landlord if
 
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
there is now a fear of if I bring an
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
issue to a landlord's attention I could
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
be evicted I think uh that power
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
differential will grow um and whether or
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
not um a tenant has access to supports
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
for recourse um I would say that uh they
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
might feel in that moment they
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
don't represent
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
Miner thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
for speaking do you think
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
that taking away the security of the
 
01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
contract ending at the end of the
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
contract would cause more housing
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
providers to do month-to-month
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
tencies rather than even giving them
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
that one-year lease and now causing them
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
to only be secure for 30 days
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
potentially I think that could be a
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
possibility which could be devastating
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
to um folks with um assisted uh rental
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
assistance so a housing Choice voucher
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
um where often a 12-month lease is
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
required that would make it even harder
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
for voucher holders to utilize their
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
voucher in New Hampshire uh but I can't
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of landlords but I
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
imagine it could it could have further
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the crisis we're seeing
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
now okay seeing no other questions thank
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you um I
 
01:01:40.589 --> 01:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
see you had written testimony if you can
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
get it to the committee that'd be great
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
Klein thank you Mr chairman I realize
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
the time is short um my name is David
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
Klein I have rental properties in the
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast Area I only want to because of
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
the time short I just want to address a
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that I heard um in
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
terms of time of evictions that that
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
time will vary depending upon the case
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
and what the defendant does and how it's
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
handled I had an eviction that ended up
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
the end of last year it took 11 months
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
because it got appealed and it got cut
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
short because the defendant did not file
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
a brief on time and the Supreme Court uh
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
dismissed the eviction short probably 90
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
60 to 90 days fees vary depending upon
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
whether you're hiring attorney you do
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
have court entry fees Sheriff's fees
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
second set of sherff fees when you get
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
the rid of possession um there are and
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why landlords are reluctant to
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
evict are you always almost always lose
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
rent on these things the apartments come
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
back more damaged in eviction cases than
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
they do on ordinary tenants who want the
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
security deposit back that means not
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
only do you have to pay to fix up the
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
apartment but you have to pay for the
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
Lost rent During the period of time then
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
for someone like me we've hired a
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
management company we have to pay the
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
management company a one month's fee for
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
rental of the apartment so it's very
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
expensive we do not evict arbitrarily we
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
think about it we try and work it out
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
with the tenants and one of the things
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
about the homelessness eviction on the
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
record if the tenant
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
leaves after the at the end of the 6
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
notice period there's no grounds to
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
evict they will not have an eviction on
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
their record as far as other apartments
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
the general statistic Nationwide is 33
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
to 40% of Apartments roll over every
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
year so there is a constant Supply and
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
and taking up of that Supply throughout
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
this state and every state even with
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
this bill the defenses to eviction set
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
forth in RSA 540 colum 13 still exists
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
they're uneffective there is a statute
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
against retaliation by the landlord
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
against the tenants particularly making
 
01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
complaints about maintenance two public
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh authorities so that those defenses
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
are still there the rent withholding is
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
still there none of that is affected by
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
this bill given the time constraints and
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
to not make you stop me I will stop
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%

empty no rentals have been done for six
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
months in my old apartment um my life is
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
still upside down I I stretched
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
financially I feel hopeless I was
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to share with friends my
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
respect was tremendously decreased and
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
medical issues have
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
increased 6 months and I'm still
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
unsettled I would want anyone maybe you
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
or your constituents with mothers and
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
fathers in rented Apartments to think
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
about this and hopefully to be able to
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
live in peace not with thoughts that the
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
landlord could put you out for no
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
reason Miss yes please think of uh the
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
human factor it could change a loved
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
one's life and not for the good I think
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%

Mr represent
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you so much for your
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
testimony I think your story is a
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
powerful example of the actual human
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
cost rather than treating people like
 
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
numbers um so my question is do you
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
think your particular situation and the
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
story that you provided and I welcome
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
you to uh provide any more details to
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
your story that you didn't have time to
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
I would be interested in hearing that do
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
you think that your story is unique or
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
unusual in terms of how housing is
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
affecting your
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
life I don't think so but this there's
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
also this senior Factor you have to
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
think about I'm not able to go out and
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
make more money to afford someplace you
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
know that it is really you know livable
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
and that's just a fact of life at this
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
point I do what I can um it's just me
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
living alone um I think there other
 
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
seniors you don't want to see your
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
mother or father on the street you know
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
you have to stop and think about that
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
too what this bill would do um they need
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
time if you're going to move you need
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
time to find someplace and they're just
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
not out there
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
anymore it took me a
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
year before I found anything
 
01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and you know I'm really in a much
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
smaller place than I had before and the
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
one I had before was
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
Tiny which like I said sits I'm rented
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
and nothing has been done to it so I
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
just don't know what else to say thank
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
you other questions thank you very much
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
hello I am Mary Smith from Manchester
 
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:32.910 align:start position:0%
hello I am Mary Smith from Manchester
New

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am strongly in support
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill um if anything I think it's
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
been watered down to make it more
 
01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:43.719 align:start position:0%
passable I would encourage this
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
committee to make the um the mandatory
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
60 days shorter to 30
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
days um I deal with bad tenants all the
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
time I'm not a landlord myself I'm a
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
rener and even in my personal experience
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
Renning I've asked my landlord for a
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
lease because I was interested in that
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
security that you can get for a
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
long-term lease and she said no and I
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
think that's perfectly acceptable
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
because that is her right this is a
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
property rights issue and there is a
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
human element many people here have
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
talked about the human element and I
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
think landlords help protect communities
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
from Bad tenants who are not a nuisance
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
to just the landlords they are a
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
nuisance to everybody who lives on the
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
premises or around the premises and so
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
giving landlords the ability to
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
evict and making that stronger in these
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
cases I don't think representative Lynn
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
would put this in if there was no uh
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
particular reason uh he is familiar with
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
the courts because he served as chief
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
justice on the New Hampshire Supreme
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
Court and if this was being upheld by
 
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
the courts then uh this bill wouldn't be
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
in front of you today and you wouldn't
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
be listening to people's testimony on it
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
so um if you have any questions relating
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
to you know any of my testimony I'm I'm
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
welcome to hear them thank you very much
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony any questions
 
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
for your testimony any questions
representative

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
Reed hi Mary nice to see you again hello
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you for your
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
testimony um in your opinion which is
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
more of a nuisance maybe a tenant that
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
has like you know loud music or whatever
 
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
might be a nuisance uh in your situation
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
or having unhoused people everywhere in
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
your community and you yourself looking
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
at the chance of being unhoused which is
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
nuisance I think the solution to I mean
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
you describe the unhoused people as a
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
nuisance I don't believe they're a
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
nuisance but um I think the solution to
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
that is something we've already heard in
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today which is loosening the
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
restrictions on building housing and
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's no part of this bill that's in
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
front of you today to be approved by
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
this committee that speaks to uh like
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
loosening those housing restrictions
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is just about what the
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
contract that the tenants sign with the
 
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
landlords and the landlord's rights to
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
for coming this morning to
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
testify um given the current uh housing
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
situation and the housing crisis in New
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
Spill I think uh any language that that
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
people have brought today about the
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
homelessness crisis and the the very low
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate less than a percent here in
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh that it is tangential
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
to this bill and not related and so
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to your question do I think
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
this is the right time yes I think any
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
time is the right time for this bill and
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's a shame that this bill even has to
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
be put forward because this is something
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
that should already be upheld by the
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
courts that is not being and that's why
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is in front of you thank you
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
very much testimony appreciate it
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
sky and I I know we're we're running a
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
bit behind I plan on powering through
 
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
lunch but if there's members of the
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
committee that need to leave um for
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reason um feel free but um I
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
didn't realize I thought an hour was
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
enough time but apparently not so um
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep moving forward go
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
ahead okay thank you uh um thank you
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander members of the
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh for allowing me time today
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca Sky I'm the executive
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire State
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging um and the uh New
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Commission on Aging um
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
advises against providing landlords the
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
rights to evict at the end of the lease
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of um of Advance written
 
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.830 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of um of Advance written
notice

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
um given the housing crisis that our
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
state is um is in at this time um this
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
is not the right time for this bill um
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
the one on one in and one out argument
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
suggested by representative Lynn puts
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable at greatest risk for
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
homelessness take for instance um an
 
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
older adult who ask for grab bars in the
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
shower and other accessibility features
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the apartment that will cost the
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
landlord for a landlord looking to
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
maximize their income who can fill that
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
um apartment easily
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
why would they not hesitate to evict a
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
person at the end of the lease putting
 
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
that older adult out on the
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
street re reinforcing why this bill will
 
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact the growing
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
older adult population in our state
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
older adults experience poverty at
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
higher rates than the general population
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
income generally declines as one as one
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
ages um the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
Institute uh in a recent report said
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
that the supplemental poverty measure
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
rate in 2022 for Granite Staters age 65
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
and older was
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
14.4% higher than the general uh uh SPM
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
for granite Staters aged 18 to 64 which
 
01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.430 align:start position:0%
for granite Staters aged 18 to 64 which
was

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
8.4% uh those with mobility issues face
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
add added hurdles uh the US Census
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau issued a report in October 2023
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
that found that less than 20% of housing
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
stock in New England is age ready that
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
is having step-free entry and bed and
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
bath on the first floor I know of a
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
couple who um moved to a Residence Inn
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
during the winter months um because the
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
accessibility issues of their apartment
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
are exacerbated during the winter months
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine um and they choose
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
that because they can't find alternative
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
housing um Miss if you could yep um if
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
you flip to the backs side of um this uh
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
testimony picture speaks of thousand
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
words um we had at the commission
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
meeting in November 2024 we had a Dr Dr
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%

this is uh from one of her slides and it
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
represents the housing cost burdens for
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
adults age 65 and older in New Hampshire
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
and yes it represents those who rent and
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
those who own thank you thank you Miss
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
Sky um I see in your test mod you have
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
some links so if you can send us an
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
electronic copy of that that' be great
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you any
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
questions represent bu um so I'm I'm
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
really glad that you brought up uh the
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact especially you
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
know people who are elderly my question
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
is there are quite a few housing
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
providers who are elderly so what would
 
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
be the impact of a lengthy and expensive
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
eviction process if you're a housing
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
provider that's elderly who depends on
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
this income that they get from a rental
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
when they have a rental property that is
 
01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.830 align:start position:0%
when they have a rental property that is
not

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
providing so I am unclear um as to the
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
difference between so a landlord going
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
through an eviction process after the
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
passage to this law versus going through
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
an eviction process um that's already
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
available through the law how's the cost
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
any different they're going to have to
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
go through the same steps and processes
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not um I'm an expert on the older
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
adults Nur State not necessarily um in
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
the housing field okay all right thank
 
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%

Hampshire thank you thank you for your
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions from Miss
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
Evans representative
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
Daxton hi so in reading this and
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about it as a as a real estate
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
agent and as a property owner I and I
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
recognize that there would be greater
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
challenges for somebody with
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities it's easy to picture that
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
why would they not see a longer term
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
lease I
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
mean they You Can a tenant could
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
negotiate for a longer term lease if I
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
if I was disabled which I hope that
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
soon uh I would and I was concerned
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
about housing why would I immediately
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
accept a one-year lease why wouldn't I
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
say to the landlord I'm going to I need
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
to stay here for a period of years and
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
negotiate for a three or four or five
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
year lease and and build an escalator in
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
or something like that thank you for the
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
question um uh I think people with
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities and Chase is here also he
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
can speak to this but um have a really
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
hard time finding um apartments to rent
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
so that going to someone already and
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
then asking for like a 5-year lease
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
would pose more problems for them to
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
then uh be able to rent an
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
apartment well I I don't followup
 
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
followup I I don't mean to be
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
argumentative but a a tenant like that
 
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
which has probably got fairly stable
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
income well if you're disabled and
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
you're you have you have a fixed income
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's stable right but not large I I
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
totally totally understand that totally
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
agree with that uh but they could they
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
could make the case for themselves that
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
they they it could be most landlords as
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
almost everybody in here has agreed
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of what side you're on are
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking for Dependable stable tenants so
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
if I know that I have someone who's
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
disabled and they are looking for long
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
term and they have stable income which
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
is honestly the biggest issue most of
 
01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
the time with a tenant and I can agree
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to a term of
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
increases uh built into to the least not
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
un unheard of I would think that would
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
make them more desirable as a tenant
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
rather than less desirable and I
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
understand it may just be an
 
01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable question that they're
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
wanting to just whatever I can get I'll
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
take but they may be able to move
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
themselves up the list by saying not
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
only will I take this for one year but
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to take it for a period of
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
years and I will I understand that your
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
costs are going to go up so I'm willing
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
a okay um I think I can get back to you
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
with more detailed information but not
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
everybody starts out renting as disabled
 
01:23:50.910 --> 01:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
so people become disabled um as they are
 
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
renters and this law would allow
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
landlords to just evict them because of
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
the because they because they want to
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
for no no cause but that happens but I
 
01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
um I will get back to you because I
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't know why Miss Evans um I we have
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
the council for developmental
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities here hopefully they can
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
help answer your question as well that
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to answer that better
 
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh representative Reed
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
my question I had a I have a follow-up
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
because I had an original question but I
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
need to kind of piggy back off of what
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
was just said so in the
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
example that was just offered to you by
 
01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
the Committee Member that a landlord
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
might be willing as we don't frequently
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
ever see negotiate a longer term longer
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
than one-ear lease because the person
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
has stable income would the current
 
01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
law not benefit that landlord more in
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
other words you could negotiate for the
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
12 months and if you decide later you
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
need more rent you are free to raise the
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
rent and if the tenant can't meet that
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
rent demand then you could then evict
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
would that not be more beneficial to the
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
landlord currently I think so yes I
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair please thank you um so
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
aside from the very poignant human costs
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
that you've pointed out and has been
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out repeatedly we know that the
 
01:25:15.070 --> 01:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
human cost argument does not get
 
01:25:18.189 --> 01:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
traction with everybody so I want to go
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
to the economic kind of realities is it
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
not true that many of the members of the
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
dis ability Community also hold jobs
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
even if just part-time and that they are
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
filling those worker needs that we
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
desperately have and so when you put
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
their housing at risk once again we are
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
pushing out the people who do the jobs
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
that we desperately need
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Gibbs thank
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
this morning to
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
testify do you have any information on
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
whether any tenants with disabilities
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
have actually um had any success in
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
negotiating long-term lease and whether
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
those long if if they have whether those
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
long-term leases have um continue to be
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
affordable given that they would
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
probably include an escalator for rent
 
01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question at this
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
moment I do not but I will definitely uh
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
get that information to you by the end
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
of the day that'd be great thank you all
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to call on Chase Eon um
 
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities believe you should already
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
have my testimony uh my name is Chase
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
eagleson I serve as the policy and
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
planning coordinator for New Hampshire
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
Council development disabilities we are
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
a federally funded state agency that's
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
mandated in all states uh to advocate
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
for the rights and responsibilities of
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
individuals uh within the development
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
disabil disabled community
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
um we come uh as may not be surprised in
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill uh as was
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned 2005 uh this type
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
of lease which is a hold over lease was
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh unanimously uh
 
01:27:09.119 --> 01:27:10.830 align:start position:0%
uh unanimously uh
determined

01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh that they need to protect tenants
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh with holder releases and again was
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh upheld in
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
2015 uh overturning this decision would
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
create uh significant hard ship for
 
01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
individuals within a disability
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
Community it's already very difficult
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
for individuals within that Community to
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
find safe stable and especially
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
accessible housing you know less than 2%
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
of housing in United States is
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
accessible uh and that's for individuals
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
with physical disabilities and uh
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities don't just
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
manifest when you're born they can
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
develop over time uh they come with
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
aging they come with any sort of thing
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
throughout life
 
01:27:57.790 --> 01:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
and uh allowing for this type of
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
eviction to occur would allow for a lot
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
more tenants uh who are developing any
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
type of disability or who have a
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
disability to be evicted due to their
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
disability and in my opinion that is not
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
just cause that is discriminate
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against people with
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities that's what this is opening
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
up uh and based in historical memory
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is something that will occur if
 
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
this is something that will occur if
this

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
passes already without this bill being
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
in place individuals with disabilities
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
face a two to three times higher rate of
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
eviction than individuals without
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities we ask you wrap up yeah of
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
course uh and displacement uh that
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
occurs from eviction
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
shatters fundamental security forcing
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
children forcing families forcing people
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
who desire to be part of the community
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
to benefit the community it shatters
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to continue to do that and
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions thank you Mr
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
eagleson is it not true that there's
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
already mechanism in law to prevent a
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
person with a disability from being
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
evicted under current law and um in the
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
case you described wouldn't you say that
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
those individuals who are evicted at
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
higher rates would have cause to sue
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
under the human rights law
 
01:29:26.669 --> 01:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
under the human rights law they might
 
01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
but if this bill passes they could be
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
evicted and they could not be said that
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's because of their disability they
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
could just be evicted and told that they
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
want to end the lease so it wouldn't
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
really be something they can
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
prove okay so just to follow up there's
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
there's currently a renovation eviction
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
right so if I say oh I need like you
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
know to renovate the property for to
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
make it an Airbnb you can already evict
 
01:29:54.189 --> 01:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
based on that I guess I'm I guess guess
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
I'm confused at how you're making the
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
connection of landlords will
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily evict because they are
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
disabled I I don't see the connection
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
there I think that's the exact point
 
01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
they already have enough mechanisms to
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
evict someone because of their
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
disability doing adding this will only
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
add to the amount of options they have
 
01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.590 align:start position:0%
add to the amount of options they have
and

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
that's again adding more discriminatory
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
purposes for evicting someone with
 
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
disability okay thank
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
you represent Reed thank you Mr chair
 
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify so what you're
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
saying is whilst currently there's
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
enough ambiguity in law that perhaps
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
landlords could be evicting unjustly
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh the unprotected oh I
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
didn't like the fact that he's a Yankees
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
fan or the very protected um they're
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
disabled and I really kind of that that
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
puts me out a little bit um there's
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
enough ambiguity in current law that
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is already happening and we can't
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
really go after it cuz it's kind of
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguous but this being absolutely no
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
cause would allow landlords to just kick
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
anyone out if they didn't like their
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
skin color or how they express
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
themselves or a disability or
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
anything thank you for your question yes
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
that's exactly my point uh this opens up
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
for any type of discrimination whether
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
it be again due to their race due their
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
disability due to any preconceived
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
notion of not wanting them to be
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
there thank you for your testimony
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to ask to if
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
you could refrain from asking would you
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%

01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions of witnesses that'd be great I

believe that was technically I was
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
asking for clarification on what he had
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
previously said great thank you thank
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%

Antman good morning honorable members of

the House housing committee uh I will be
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
brief thank you for hearing my testimony
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
today my name is Alyssa Antman I'm a
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
resident of conquered and I am here in
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
hb60 this bill as you've heard would
 
01:32:11.310 --> 01:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
already um harm marginalized populations
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
including the lgbtq plus and disability
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
Community leaving people without a place
 
01:32:19.470 --> 01:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
to live while we can assume best
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
intentions from landlords in my
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
experience not all landlords are
 
01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of all identities um my
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
identity as an lgbtq plus and disabled
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
person puts me at a higher risk of
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
housing insecurity and this bill only
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
exacerbates this issue and I'm going to
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
share my story very briefly like I said
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
in 2016 I rented a studio apartment with
 
01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
my partner at the time it was small our
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen sink only a few feet from our
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
bed and one window that only stayed open
 
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
when propped up by a piece of wood it
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
was home however it was never truly a
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
safe space for us when we signed the
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
lease to the apartment our landlords
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
warned us you girls need to stick
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
together and no boys over which was not
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
a problem for me um however it was clear
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
that they didn't understand or want to
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
understand that we were romantically
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
involved they touted their traditional
 
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
family values and quickly it became
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
clear how unaccepting they would be of
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
our true relationship we were living out
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
of different motels at the time and had
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere else to go and only enough
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
savings to cover one month's rent and a
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
security deposit um the longer we stayed
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
the more question we got from our
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
landlords they began to overstep and
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
intrude and they poked around our
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
personal lives and during regular
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our apartment our
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
landlords even interrogated us as to why
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
there was only one bed in the apartment
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
it was incredibly intrusive and it's
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
extremely demoralizing to hide and mask
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
Your Existence because you're in
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
constant fear for your housing security
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
as someone who also lives with a mental
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
health disability a landlord could
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
decide they don't want to rent to
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
someone with a disability and it
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the first time I've been
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
exposed to hurtful and dangerous stigma
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
around that this bill gives landlords
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
the power to evict people like me by
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
providing them the tools to do so in
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
State statue hiding my identity is not
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
an option if I need to access emergency
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
services in a crisis moment the last
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
thing I should worry about is their
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
presence leading to my possible eviction
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
my story is just one story among
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of Granit stators who would be
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
harmed by this bill this could happen to
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
someone in a similar situation today if
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
this bill passes
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
everyone deserves equal access to
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
housing um for that reason I'm asking
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
you to vote in expedient to legislate so
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
that people from already marginalized
 
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
groups aren't left without a place to
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
live thank you for your time thank you
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
Miss Sam and for your testimony is there
 
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.270 align:start position:0%
Miss Sam and for your testimony is there
any

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
helloo thank you for the opportunity to
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
be able to speak to you about hb60 um my
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
name is Jennifer Chisum I am the
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
coalition to end homelessness and we are
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill as you could
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
probably imagine um and so I have
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
submitted some written testimony um and
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
we'll also be Distributing our um state
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
of homelessness in New Hampshire reports
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
um that should happen later this week um
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
I will keep my comments brief today
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
however um so given the state of
 
01:35:33.149 --> 01:35:33.159 align:start position:0%
homelessness and housing instability in
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now an ounce of
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
prevention is currently worth at least
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
10 pounds of cure and instead of pre
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
preventing evictions hp60 would
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately move the needle in the
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
wrong direction and so we do understand
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
that sometimes evictions do need to
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
happen and New Hampshire already has to
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
just cause statutes in place that are um
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
effective um the question had come up
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
about how hb60 would impact homelessness
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
and so on its surface it may seem that
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
evicting one family when their lease
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
ends and replacing them with new renters
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
is a net zero situation but it's just
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
not that simple once their housing is
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
lost for no cause under hp60 many New
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families who pay their rent on
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
time and comply with the terms of their
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
leases will require significant
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
community support and resources from
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
places like nonprofit programs or local
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
welfare offices in order to restabilize
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
and obtain new housing that is safe
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
stable and affordable it's a lot of work
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
especially right now um for individuals
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
families households um to find new
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
housing as you have heard already from
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
other people um so we are extremely
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about families even those
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
families of median income um and so the
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
number of people and families who were
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
homeless in New Hampshire from January
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
to December of 2023 um jumped to
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
2,335 individuals which is an increase
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
of almost 50% over 2022 is numbers um
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
and so just to note these numbers do not
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
take into consideration anybody who's
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
doubled up um and so staying in an
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
unstable situation with maybe friends or
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
family um we are also particularly
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the post potential
 
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
impacts of hb60 on Aging adults in the
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
granite state no cause eviction laws
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
such as hb60 have been shown to
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
negatively affect uh the elderly
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionately ask you to wrap up
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
yep um and so just given the
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
vulnerability of this population the
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
current eviction laws offer
 
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
significantly more protection to aging
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
tenants um in New Hampshire is an
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
quickly aging State the number of older
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
adults um is uh projected to double
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
within the next 20 years um and so with
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
effective eviction laws already in place
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the negative effects of no cause
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
evictions um on families and vulnerable
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
populations um we respectfully encourage
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh the committee members um to vote
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
against hb60 thank you thank you for the
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there

01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's been demonst
 
01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
research has demonstrated that um
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
eviction without cause has a dis
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
disproportionate impact on um seniors or
 
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing can you point us to that
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
research on where this has happened

elsewhere and how that has had that
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
impact yeah I'd be more than happy to

maybery good morning good morning I was
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%

name is Matt mayber I'm the CEO of the
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire homebuilders Association
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to spend a whole lot of
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
time together this year cuz we're going
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
to tackle this Challenge and Conquer it
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
quick backstory on me because a lot of
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
you have seen a 50-year-old all right
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
fine 60 year old white male working for
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of Rich
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
developers I'm gay I'm a disabled
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
veteran I lost my housing during the
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
economic downturn I lost my housing
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
because I was gay been there done that
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
we oppose this because we actually would
 
01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
like to see it go from 60-day notice to
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
30-day notice because we have to
 
01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
remember these are all adults and at
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
leas is a contractual relationship not a
 
01:39:36.239 --> 01:39:37.310 align:start position:0%
leas is a contractual relationship not a
moral

01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
moral
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
obligation this is not a onesided
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
agreement we're not making you stay
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're not making you
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
leave I've been a housing provider and
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
I've been a tenant and I can guarantee
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
you that the minute you serve that
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
60-day notice or a 30-day notice the
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
tenant stops paying rent you start
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
losing money and they stick around
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
you're going into court and you're
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
losing more
 
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
money any tenant can ask for a new
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
contract they can ask for an extension
 
01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.430 align:start position:0%
contract they can ask for an extension
in

01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
writing if they choose not to do that
 
01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
that is upon
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
them also one thing that we should
 
01:40:23.589 --> 01:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
factor in that costs go up taxes go up
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
my taxes in Rochester went up $1,400
 
01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.310 align:start position:0%
my taxes in Rochester went up $1,400
this

01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
year oil and heating have gone
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
up but yet no one's talking about that
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
the tenants should participate in that
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
in their rent
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
payments it keeps getting pushed back
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
onto the housing
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
provider and I'm glad you find it funny
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
ma'am but there are folks who actually
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
make a living from providing housing and
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
when you're asking them to do more
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
putting more constraints on them will
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
close that siphon of housing down even
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
further so chairman I see you moving
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
forward so I'm going to shut up but
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
happy to take your questions I said
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend a lot of time
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
together and landlords don't arbitrarily
 
01:41:11.709 --> 01:41:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
consistency I'll stop thank you for your
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr bber questions
 
01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:17.990 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr bber questions
representative

01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify this morning ma um
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
when the costs for a landlord increase
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
when the taxes increase and when the uh
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
cost of oil and and other expenses for
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
heating and so forth um when those
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
increase don't the landlords raise the
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
rent yes
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
ma'am but if you're if you're in a lease
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
and you're in a contractual agreement
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
signed by two
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
adults you're locked into that rent so
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
when your contract has an expiration
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
date on it and you've known
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
for 11 months 29 days when the
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
expiration date of that contract is
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's up for
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
negotiation follow up follow up Mr
 
01:42:08.109 --> 01:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
chair when the lease is up doesn't the
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
landlord raise the rent then you're
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
making a lot of assumptions ma'am
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
because sometimes people like to have it
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
the consistency of a long-term tenant
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know uh the representative mentioned
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
about negotiating a multi-year lead with
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
a rider in
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
there my my members and myself would say
 
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes please we'd love to have
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
you stay for multiple
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
years housing providers don't look for
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities to ask people to
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
leave profits come from having someone
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
stay for multiple years but if the rents
 
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
and cost of providing housing go
 
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
up isn't it fair and appropriate to ask
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
increase or should they just be locked
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
Life quickly representative Gibbs thank
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
you sir um but when those costs go up
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the lease is expired doesn't the
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
landlord raise the rent can't the
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
landlord raise the rent is there
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
anything stopping the landlord from
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
raising the rent or not raising the rent
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
they may choose to eat that cost they
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
may like the the 10 that they have they
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
may whatever their situation is it's not
 
01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:27.830 align:start position:0%
may whatever their situation is it's not
an

01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
automatic it is a choice it is a choice
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
to stay is a choice to move is a choice
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
to increase the rent is a choice to ask
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
for a multi-year contract or in advance
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
if you're nine months into a lease you
 
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
could say to the housing provider hey in
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
a couple months it's coming up can I get
 
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
a new contract I want to
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
stay there are options on both sides
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
ma'am represent
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
re thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
Mayberry and as you know I uh you all
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
in oh my apologies I think I did that go
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
ahead so rude Mr
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
chair um agree on what has been
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned today as one of the solutions
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
or perhaps even the the biggest solution
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
to the housing crisis which is the
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
easing up of restrictions on buildings
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
so I want to start with the fact that we
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
are in agreement on at least that much
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
um my question and I may have follow-ups
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
um is that you talk about the contract
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
and much has been made about the
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
contract this is a contract between two
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
adults contract is it is it not true
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
that contracts inherently have to be
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
within the bounds of the current law in
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
other words you cannot sign a contract
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
in violation of Law and so when you sign
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
that contract as to grown adults you are
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
signing the contract with the
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that whatever is in law is
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
also applicable so in other words when
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
the people are entering into contracts
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
currently they're entering into a lease
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge including the
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
landlords with the knowledge that you
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be no cause evicted at the end of
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
that lease that's already negotiated in
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
question the contract has a beginning
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
date and an end date and the terms and
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
conditions within that are agreed to by
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
two adults and if you have questions of
 
01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
counsel so just to be very clear in case
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
you may be able to answer it now um so
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
the terms and conditions in that
 
01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
contract have to be legal they cannot be
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
illegal and so all parties both parties
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
are aware of that when they come in to
 
01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
negotiate that contract so they are
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
negotiating the terms and conditions of
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
that contract
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
that is within the bounds of the law
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
currently that means that the
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
understanding between both parties and
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
if landlords don't like this they don't
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to rent anything out that the
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that yes you get to
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
stay here because it's the law so long
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
as you don't violate the the conditions
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
of that lease that's already being
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
negotiated in is it
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%

01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
question okay represent bolo uh thank
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I have a it's much
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
much a lot of us have been talking about
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
the housing shortage which I think a lot
 
01:46:47.950 --> 01:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
of us recognize as a major problem in
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire my question is um in your
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
experience um representing home builders
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
um does making it harder to end a tency
 
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
making it harder to end a tency does
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
that incentivize or disincentivize
 
01:47:02.189 --> 01:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
investors to invest in building
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
additional housing
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
units it
 
01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
units it
completely

01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
completely
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
disincentivizes it why why do they need
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
hassle be people want to make you know
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
their business model is to provide
 
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
housing at terms that everyone can live
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
with and go with
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
the harder you make it the less excited
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
people are about providing it when you
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
have that extra room in your basement or
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
thanks to Chairman Alexander we have a
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
kickass Adu Bill coming through that we
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
help sales through this committee
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
hint that should provide additional
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
housing for
 
01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
folks thank
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed thank you Mr
 
01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed thank you Mr
chair

01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
thanks to my Adu bill um so you said
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
that uh that landlords at in large do
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
are not looking for reasons to PE kick
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
people out I would argue that the fact
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill exists and has kept coming
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
back is in fact the landlords looking
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
for reasons to kick people out that are
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
not currently allowed things like what
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
we've heard um who we love and and what
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
we like and how we live so my question
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
is when you're talking about that and
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
you're saying that as soon as you evict
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
someone they stop paying rent are you
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
aware that that if you go to court with
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
them the fact that they stopped paying
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
rent puts them in a much weaker position
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
in court and so in fact they are advised
 
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
largely to continue to pay the existing
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
rent and many of them who are listening
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
to the legal advice actually do continue
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
to pay the existing rent are you aware
 
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.149 align:start position:0%
to pay the existing rent are you aware
of

01:48:45.149 --> 01:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
that I've been there I've lived it and
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
the you know it's nice living in Utopia
 
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
but they stop paying the rent and so
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
when you have to take them to the court
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's more legal fees upon the housing
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
provider to try to go get the rent that
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
is legally obligated to you so you're
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
ring up more cost and you're allowing
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're losing even more rent
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative I and representative what
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
you can do I can gladly meet with you

Val good morning my name is Will arell

01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
director of Crossroads house which is
 
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
the second largest homeless shelter in
 
01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.709 align:start position:0%
the second largest homeless shelter in
the

01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
state we um take care of individuals and
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
Families both in Rockingham and straford
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
counties uh we also serve as the warming
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
shelter for all of Rockingham
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
County um we currently are maxed out in
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
our beds and we have about 112 beds so
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're all full uh we have a waiting
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
list of a couple of hundred
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
people um both of those in terms of the
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
filling the beds and in terms of our
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
weight list those have have been
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
increasing over the last several years
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting to note that the
 
01:50:28.109 --> 01:50:28.119 align:start position:0%
folks that are coming to us are not
 
01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
typically what you would Envision as
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
homeless uh these are for the most part
 
01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
not individuals that are drug addicts or
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
individuals that are ex incarcerated
 
01:50:42.189 --> 01:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
these are individuals like that women
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
who was here earlier
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
testifying um people in their 60s and
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
70s um with underlying health issues
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities who have been pushed out um
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
out of their homes most mostly because
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
they're unlimited incomes and can't
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
afford to stay in their homes and as a
 
01:51:08.189 --> 01:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
last resort as the uh they come to us uh
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
unwillingly um many of them having
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
transition from their houses to a car
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
and then to us um because they see it as
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
a as a a a an issue of dignity
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
and um so I'm speaking purely uh uh in
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 60
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
because we see this continuing in terms
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
of um having people come to us and this
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
is not just crossover's house it's the
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
whole shelter system is really at
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
capacity and bursting at the seams and
 
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
we really uh anything like this that we
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we think is going to uh impact um
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
the whole housing system and our ability
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
to house individuals in a negative way
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
we have to stand up and say no because
 
01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
we know we're going to we're going to
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
continue to see more people uh come to
 
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
us we can't uh address the the all the
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
need right now but um we also know that
 
01:52:13.390 --> 01:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
if if you could wrap up that'd be great
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
sure um that the average state for us is
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
about 60 days the fact that more and
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
more people come to us uh uh make it
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
more difficult for us to place people
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh in housing and uh so for for those
 
01:52:28.669 --> 01:52:28.679 align:start position:0%
those reasons we oppose this thank you
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
for your testimony representative Paige
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so first and
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
foremost thank you for your
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
work um so my question is we we've been
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about uh cost to landlords
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
the cost landlords assume in going
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
through an eviction process and I'm I'm
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to that I'm a landlord I
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
understand what folks are talking about
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
um we H what we haven't heard a lot
 
01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
about is the cost of serving folks who
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
are displaced through bills like this uh
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm curious what you've seen in
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
terms of increased costs um as you're
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
seeking to serve more and more people
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
affected by this crisis yes so that
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
there is um ju just uh in terms of what
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
we do on a day-to-day basis there's a
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
cost to that and there's a we we uh our
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
cost is about $120 a day and that
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
includes bad meals uh case management
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
and and so forth um there is additional
 
01:53:29.430 --> 01:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
cost to the individuals uh that uh would
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
they they have to pick up from their
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
communities um bring their children to
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
the shelter and and all that get disrupt
 
01:53:37.229 --> 01:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
gets disrupted so breaking up of
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
communities and families and so forth so
 
01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:43.159 align:start position:0%
that's huge um and then there's the cost
 
01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
of trying to get those individuals back
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
into housing and and what that costs um
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we believe
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
believe very strongly in is that uh in
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
order for us to help both individual
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
residents and families stay in housing
 
01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
um and build these really good strong
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
relationships with landlords there has
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
to be supportive services and Supportive
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
Services also come out a cost but we
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
believe that that is serves the the
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
tenant and it serves the landlord um in
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
very strong ways and I think that
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
there's um as you go forth and you have
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
these conversations about uh how do we
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
better house individuals particularly
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
individuals with uh disabilities mental
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
health issues and so forth that that has
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
to be part of the equation and that
 
01:54:32.589 --> 01:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
comes at a cost so there there are many
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
pipeline any other questions yes
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
represent read thank you um and thank
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and your work uh
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
which is much needed so we heard uh
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
testimony from a previous person that in
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
repeated testimony that this is
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
something that can be negotiated with
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
the landlord when you move in you can
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
negotiate a long contractor or what have
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
you um is it your experience in the
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
people that you've worked with that they
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
felt that and I will just add in the
 
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
market that is heavily skewed towards
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
landlords with 6% vacancy that they felt
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
empowered or emboldened at all to
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate with their
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
landlords I will say that those
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who are homeless at our
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
disadvantage first of all many of them
 
01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
have been homeless for quite a long time
 
01:55:32.109 --> 01:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
for a variety of different reasons um we
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to be in partnership with them as
 
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
we have these conversations with
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
landlords so that they feel they they're
 
01:55:41.709 --> 01:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
getting uh well represented and and they
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
feel like somebody's looking out for
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
them um it it is really hard and and we
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
do this every day to recruit landlords
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
and to get them to understand or or have
 
01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
a willingness to work with us um so we
 
01:55:56.669 --> 01:55:56.679 align:start position:0%
do that on a daily basis and they and
 
01:55:59.310 --> 01:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
and to the credit of some landlords they
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
are willing to spend with us and W with
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
our tenants or with our residents um to
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
get them rehoused but that is the
 
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule we really uh again
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
what this creates is a bottleneck on the
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
front line on the front end of things
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
with the weight list and then on the
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
back side because we can't place people
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
fast enough because we have to build
 
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
those Rel relationships with landlords
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
and make them feel comfortable that if
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
anything goes wrong we're going to be
 
01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
there for them and if something is
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
broken in those that apartment that
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to help them get
 
01:56:36.669 --> 01:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
through that but that's again an
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule not all shelters
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
are able to do that we do that because
 
01:56:44.589 --> 01:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
we know that um residents sometimes need
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
that assistance and again we're about
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
really trying to find a middle ground
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
between the needs of the landlord and
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
the needs of the tenant and I think
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way forward but right now
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
where we sit um in our housing um the
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
our tenants particularly I mean our
 
01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
disadvantage representative
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify this morning um in
 
01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:15.709 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify this morning um in
your

01:57:15.709 --> 01:57:15.719 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
experience uh when you try to get your
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
clients into housing is it in fact
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
possible for you and your client to
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate the terms of a lease with the
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
landlord are the landlords willing to
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
negotiate the terms of a lease for
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
instance to make it a longer term lease
 
01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:35.719 align:start position:0%
rather than a one-year
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
lease um unfortunately I'm not that
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with it but I believe that when
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
we negotiate leases we we are at a
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
disadvantage again and so we are trying
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
to negotiate leases that are favorable
 
01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
to the landlord because we want to make
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
sure we build that relationship over
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
time and um I'm guessing but I think
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
that in most cases they're one-year
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
leases represent Miner thank you Mr
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
chairman it goes along the lines of
 
01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
everything that was basically just
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
answered but in your experience dealing
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
with landlords do you find that they
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
would prefer to do a month-to month even
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
over a one-year lease because at the end
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the lease they still have to deal
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
with eviction stuff and it's just more
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
timec consuming we don't we we don't
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
commit to one two-month leases because
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
we don't want people coming back to the
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
shelter so we're looking at at least a
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
oneyear lease um with the with the
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
stipulation that we're going to be there
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
to work with the tenant over time and
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to remain with the tenant as
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
long as they need us um we we just that
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be awfully traumatizing for a
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
tenant to get a month Le month-to-month
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
lease and get evicted have to come back
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
to the shelters especially a family or
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's elderly disabled um that
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
that would that would not work well and
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we pursue can
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
I just follow up yep would be having the
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
oneyear lease and the landlords or
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
housing providers being comfortable with
 
01:59:10.069 --> 01:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
a one-year lease taking on a risk uh
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
possibly do you think that
 
01:59:16.109 --> 01:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
having the ability to terminate it at
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
the end of the one years if things are
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
not going well makes them a little more
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
comfortable even accepting them
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
well it it it happens sometimes I mean
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes those relationships don't work
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
out and they end up coming back to the
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
shelter I I will say that in uh 90 about
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
97% of the cases where we place people
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
in housing those relationships are are
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
are successful a year after um so they
 
01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
stay stably housed so our experience has
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
been that that they're stably housed but
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
but I I don't uh see um where we gain
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
any by having a bill that allows people
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
to uh terminate uh housing for no cost I
 
02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
just you know again I I fear that the
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
roles of the homeless are going to
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
continue to grow in the state and as we
 
02:00:09.069 --> 02:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
were already somebody already testified
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
um we had a 50 52% increase from 2022 to
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
2023 um we're in a very precarious State
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
um there you know we have to really care
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
for our vulnerable population so this is
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
as much as you know
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
like I understand the contractual piece
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh and the ownership piece but this is
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
also a
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
human um um uh story many I mean all the
 
02:00:40.149 --> 02:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
people that come to us yeah if you are
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
ever ever on the Sea Coast and you want
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
to come in and visit and you want to uh
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
sit with folks and they can tell you
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
their individual stories it is you know
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunate that they're there with
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
us but um these are very real stories
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
and they they're they're stories about
 
02:00:58.589 --> 02:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
people who should not be at a place like
 
02:00:58.599 --> 02:01:01.069 align:start position:0%
people who should not be at a place like
Crossroads

02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
Crossroads
 
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
Marsh good
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Todd Marsh I am the
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
President president of and uh
 
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire local

Welfare Association uh my planned
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
five-minute remarks will be a bridged
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I understand why um it's great to
 
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
see so many familiar faces in front of
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
me and behind me uh the New Hampshire
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
local welfare administrator Association
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
is a professional organization that
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
educates and supports our Municipal
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
members to Foster humanitarian and
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible assistance
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
practices uh made up of small towns all
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
across the state including larger
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well uh
 
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
um page two again a bridged um as you
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
are as you are aware landlord
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
protections already exist many already
 
02:02:06.510 --> 02:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
exist imagine a mother of two lease not
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
being renewed not because of owed rent
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
not because of her family's Behavior
 
02:02:13.709 --> 02:02:13.719 align:start position:0%
damages to her their apartment reporting
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
mold um or planned Renovations but
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
because she simply practiced her rights
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
as a tenant she inqu ired to have the
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
sink fixed Express concern the
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
electrical outlet Sparks or she
 
02:02:29.149 --> 02:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
practiced her rights as a human
 
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
being by turning down an unwanted
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
Advance by her
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
landlord good luck trying to prove that
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
all of those lastly imagine a state
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
where a verified good cause for eviction
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
is replaced by fear replaced with dis
 
02:02:48.149 --> 02:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
discretionary retribution resulting in
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
the loss of a very basic need housing
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
not not practiced by most landlords of
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
many we have heard from supporters that
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
an unfair contractual agreement exists
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
weighted towards renters and not it
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
weighted towards uh renters and not
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
landlords as renters can choose not to
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
renew a lease and landlords cannot
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
different compared to other types of
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
contracts why because the ability to end
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
a very basic need to all of us housing
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
is a power imbalance heavily weighted in
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
favor of landlords that is why the
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
existing law focuses on verifiable
 
02:03:32.589 --> 02:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
reasons to evict and there are many and
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
not discretionary ones without cause I'm
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to wrap up please
 
02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:40.830 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to wrap up please
absolutely

02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
also in the last three tries the change
 
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
has been presented as Pro housing by
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
increasing landlord discretionary
 
02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
flexibility giving people the chance uh
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
at housing that may not they they may
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
not otherwise have our associate our
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
association believes that too many
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
consequences would be outweighed and
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
outnumbered flexible de in outnumber of
 
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.669 align:start position:0%
outnumbered flexible de in outnumber of
flexible

02:04:02.669 --> 02:04:02.679 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
decisions I will lastly say that I know
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
all of you support increasing housing
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities you are sensitive to
 
02:04:13.229 --> 02:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers increasing housing throughout
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
our state begins not by not decreasing
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
housing by closing doors behind our
 
02:04:20.199 --> 02:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
housing by closing doors behind our
residents

02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%

Paige thank you Mr chair so my question
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
is back to sort of Co the costs question
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
costs of passing this
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
bill um are your members in Municipal
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
Welfare Offices seeing increased costs
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
with the current surge uh in the UN
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
unhoused and do you think that we could
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
see additional costs um in Municipal
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
Welfare Offices if this bill Le to
 
02:04:55.470 --> 02:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
additional homelessness we are um and we
 
02:04:57.629 --> 02:04:57.639 align:start position:0%
do but believe that this bill would lead
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
to additional
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%

been in the law for the last 40 years 40
 
02:06:32.430 --> 02:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
years and landlords appear to be doing
 
02:06:34.549 --> 02:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
just fine if you look at what rents are
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%

02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
important and I know you understand this

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
withstanding the current law developers
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
are dying to do more to do more
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
developing they're not running away from
 
02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
being landlords
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
now one of the handouts I gave you is
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
the eviction law itself RSA 54 section
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
two and I just want in addition to the
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
laundry list of specific good causes
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
there is other good cause and this goes
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
this is just essential it says it
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to any
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
legitimate business or economic reason
 
02:07:20.669 --> 02:07:20.679 align:start position:0%
and need not be based on the action or
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
inaction of the the tenants in addition
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 540 section 16a provides
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for a hearsay exception so
 
02:07:32.549 --> 02:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
when T when a landlord brings a
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
behavior-based eviction if they keep
 
02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
basic business records they don't have
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
to call the
 
02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:42.629 align:start position:0%
to call the
witness

02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.270 --> 02:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
now the one of the things that I think
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
one of the represent there that may not
 
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
there may not be understanding of is
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
even if there is no leas all landlords
 
02:07:57.149 --> 02:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
in the state have to have good cause for
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
eviction except for the few exception
 
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
such as owner occupied single family
 
02:08:05.069 --> 02:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
home I'm sorry owner occupied four unit
 
02:08:05.079 --> 02:08:05.870 align:start position:0%
home I'm sorry owner occupied four unit
or

02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
less um and single family homes
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise all tenants leaste or all
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
tenants whether they're in um any kind
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
of housing with no lease they still has
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
to the landlord still has to prove good
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
cause to evi Mr bar if you could wrap up
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
for us that'd be great a contract is a
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
contract the law specifically recognizes
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
the the adhesion contract where the
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining power between the parties is
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly uh uh unequal so that
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
what you get is a take it or leave it
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
proposition and that's exactly what the
 
02:08:44.189 --> 02:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
market has
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
today um I should also mention that the
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
way the bill is written now it will
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
eviscerate all good cause protections
 
02:08:56.669 --> 02:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
because after 6 months every six months
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
the tenant can be evicted for no cause
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
at very least no matter what you do at
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
least extend that to once a year let me
 
02:09:07.709 --> 02:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
point out that in order to uh to rent a
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
new apartment you have to have first
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
month's rent and a security deposit
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's almost $4,000 if you have to do
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
that twice in a year that's as much in
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
total income as a person on SSI has
 
02:09:24.549 --> 02:09:24.559 align:start position:0%
probably three4 of the income of
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
somebody on Social Security that's just
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
not doable Mr Barry thank you for your
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
testimony are questions take any
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Nick Taylor I'm the
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
director of housing action New Hampshire
 
02:09:56.189 --> 02:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
we're an organization that advocates for
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
pro housing policies in increasing
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
access to housing our members include
 
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
developers landlords housing financers
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
property managers homeless service
 
02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
providers and Supportive Service
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
Providers so we run the gamut here we
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
are in opposition to House Bill 60 I'm
 
02:10:13.549 --> 02:10:13.559 align:start position:0%
not going to repeat many of the points
 
02:10:14.910 --> 02:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
that have been made you all know it's a
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
tight housing market and that if someone
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
is evicted it's going to be really
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
challenging for them to find a place to
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
live that they they can afford in their
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
Community that's going to lead to more
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
disruption disruption for their children
 
02:10:27.750 --> 02:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
in their school system disruption in
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
their unemployment the status of
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
employment when we know we have a
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenge as well there are
 
02:10:37.149 --> 02:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
many existing legal Avenues as has been
 
02:10:40.069 --> 02:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
discussed to evict someone there is also
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh free mediation for eviction and
 
02:10:43.549 --> 02:10:43.559 align:start position:0%
eviction diversion at the judicial
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
system so there are Avenues to deal with
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
challenges there's no reason to create
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
more housing instability at a moment
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
when Market is unlike anything we have
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
ever seen we look forward to working
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
with this Committee in the coming weeks
 
02:10:59.950 --> 02:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
and months on a lot of Regulation to
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
increase access to housing this is not
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
one of them we urge you to vote in
 
02:11:05.709 --> 02:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and happy to
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you Mr Taylor
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
02:11:12.549 --> 02:11:12.559 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you Jake
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
Barry and I believe Judith Jones
 
02:11:15.079 --> 02:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
Barry and I believe Judith Jones
together

02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
I know there's two of you but I ask to
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
just keep your testimony short as short
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
as you can
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
please we can certainly do one at a time
 
02:11:31.229 --> 02:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
if you'd prefer but uh Mr chairman
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
name is Jake Barry this is my colleague
 
02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
Judith Jones we both work for new
 
02:11:37.149 --> 02:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
Futures which as many of you know is a
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit nonpartisan Health policy and
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization in addition to our
 
02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
work around substance use and Healthcare
 
02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
access we are New Hampshire's kids count
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
organization and we lead the policy work
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Alliance for
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
healthy aging all this to say we
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
advocate for health and wellbeing across
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
the Lifetime and we strongly oppose this
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
bill as it threatens to undermine the
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
health and well-being of all the
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
populations we aim to serve Judith is
 
02:11:59.950 --> 02:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
going to talk in for a minute about the
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
Deep Impact uh on Aging adults uh but I
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
want to representative uh Lynn pointed
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
out that eviction is a onetoone exchange
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
but when considering that I think it's
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
critical to consider who who is coming
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
in and who is going out more to the
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
point who is a preferred tenant is a
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
preferred tenant uh family with young
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
children is it somebody who's
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing in treatment for substance
 
02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
use disorder Behavioral Health is it an
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
aging adult on a fixed income and what
 
02:12:26.589 --> 02:12:26.599 align:start position:0%
options are available to them should
 
02:12:29.709 --> 02:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
they be evicted I I will say any of
 
02:12:32.189 --> 02:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
these folks who lose uh who lose housing
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
and not only not only they lose housing
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
stability that it directly impacts their
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
a their access to child care to Health
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
Care Services uh and to the Aging
 
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
Services that J Judith is going to point
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
out I can't imagine why we are in the
 
02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
midst of a housing homelessness housing
 
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
and homelessness crisis like we are a
 
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
child care crisis like we are an aging
 
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
crisis like we are why we would do away
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
with this basic B uh uh basic tenant
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
protection and with that I'll turn it
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
over to Judith good morning I'm so
 
02:12:59.310 --> 02:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
grateful to be before you I know you're
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
tired and I'm probably hungry so let me
 
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
be quick many people have highlighted
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
the impact to older adults in New
 
02:13:07.350 --> 02:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but thought just two
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
statistics might be helpful in this
 
02:13:12.189 --> 02:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
nation the fastest growing population of
 
02:13:14.549 --> 02:13:14.559 align:start position:0%
unhoused are the elderly in New
 
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the report from the New
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire coalition to in houseless
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness in 2024 show shows that
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
this is happening in New Hampshire what
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
did it show that there's an increase in
 
02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness for
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who are 55 and older of 23%
 
02:13:36.430 --> 02:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
from 2019 to 2022 so what we're talking
 
02:13:39.549 --> 02:13:39.559 align:start position:0%
about today is not hypothetical the
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
other theme that you've heard that's
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
important is that these are human
 
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
stories but I know this body having
 
02:13:49.950 --> 02:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
grown up in New Hampshire thankfully is
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
impacted by human sto stories but these
 
02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
human stories are also economic stories
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
so human hardship results in economic
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
hardship so want just to
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
translate that honoring the need for
 
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
economic stability for older adults and
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
that house bill 60 would increase inst
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
stability increase costs through Health
 
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
impacts create isolation and
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement so we stand strong in
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
our opposition to House Bill 60 well
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the two of you for
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
testimony are there questions from the
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank

call on Rachel gagy as well to come up

02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:46.470 align:start position:0%
 
speak

02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
maybe good afternoon now um my name is
 
02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Jessica
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
Marson and I am here um as myself or by
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
myself with Rachel though to oppose hb60
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hurry up and get through um
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
with what I like to would like to speak
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
on what I commonly like to do is listen
 
02:15:06.719 --> 02:15:07.549 align:start position:0%
on what I commonly like to do is listen
to

02:15:07.549 --> 02:15:07.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
everybody's um speech
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
and try
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
make there's sometimes there's
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
misinformation and I don't think they
 
02:15:19.629 --> 02:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
mean it as misinformation but when you
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
withhold a few words or you say things a
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
certain way it could be mistaken and I
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
think that you guys um need some of the
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
answers better um so and a background on
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
why I'm able to answer these um the way
 
02:15:35.069 --> 02:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
I am I have run a tenant Clinic out of
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester since um September 27th
 
02:15:41.310 --> 02:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
2022 and in that course I've even helped
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
two tenants win their Supreme Court
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
appeal so I've seen many different types
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
of court cases um and how long they last
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
and what the problems are and why they
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
don't go through for some of these
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
landlords and a lot of times it is
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination or they apply the law
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
incorrectly don't do the right dates
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
don't do the right time so when Mi um Mr
 
02:16:03.910 --> 02:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
Nick Norman spoke about very difficult
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
to evict tenants stuff like disturbance
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
there there's right to quiet enjoyment
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
of premises so there's a very quick
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
eviction um one of the quickest out
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
there so if you're uh harming the
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
property you're dealing drugs you're a
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
threat to your neighbors um that is easy
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
to prove with a little bit of effort you
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
have some cameras you have police logs
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
documentation it takes documentation
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
like it takes due diligence to pick out
 
02:16:33.629 --> 02:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
the right tenants for your buildings it
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
takes effort um the other things I'd
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
like to make sure I speak on are Noah
 
02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring affordable housing
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
so a majority of our housing was lost um
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
through renovation evictions we saw how
 
02:16:51.750 --> 02:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
renovation evictions were used used at
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
their will and as they spoke when it's
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
hard to evict a tenant one way the legal
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
way that is used to make sure it goes
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
through we've heard that before um many
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
landlords commonly prefer not to resign
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
a lease and keep the tenant month to-
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
month they are then able to raise the
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
rent as needed if they want to get that
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
tenant out of there they have good cause
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
evictions and they can also price that
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
tenant out which I've seen many times
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to remind everybody
 
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
um tenants might get upset when they
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
hear that the landlords have had it hard
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
when we've had our rent almost more than
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
doubled in many occasions especially
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
with that naturally occurring affordable
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
housing I'd like to remind that the
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
largest portion of the homeless um I'm
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm trying to hurry and it's
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
making it harder for me to actually
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
speak properly um the largest portion of
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
the homeless population is elderly and
 
02:17:47.709 --> 02:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
disabled which also takes up the lowest
 
02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
of the Ami um and what that brings me to
 
02:17:52.359 --> 02:17:57.429 align:start position:0%
of the Ami um and what that brings me to
is

02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the length of time it takes to find
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
an apartment commonly I hear of those
 
02:18:04.349 --> 02:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
with modest means talking about it
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
taking them up to 3 months to find an
 
02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
apartment 3 months being very common
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
those are those with 100% area median
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
income and up so when you're speaking
 
02:18:16.790 --> 02:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
about those with the lowest at 30% to
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
50% area median income which is your
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
fixed income such as me and Rachel here
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
um those take commonly a year Rachel
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
took well over a year to find her
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
apartment many of my tenants have um I'd
 
02:18:32.669 --> 02:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
also like to speak about the human
 
02:18:35.549 --> 02:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
rights violation I have a tenant that
 
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
over a year ago the eviction process was
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
started but before it was started she
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
was sent messages from her landlord
 
02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
telling her that the apartment is not
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
for disabled people I can tell you that
 
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
in 17 years of doing this it's not very
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
common to get it and writing so
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
explicitly and direct but even with
 
02:18:56.469 --> 02:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
something that explicit and direct it's
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
been well over a year and there's been
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
no movement on that um complaint but
 
02:19:03.309 --> 02:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
what has happened to the tenant in that
 
02:19:05.469 --> 02:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
time period is they went through the
 
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
court process they got evicted they
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
appealed to Supreme Court there was a
 
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
the appeals are hard for tenants to go
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
through I can't do it for them I can
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
show them how I can lead them to the
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
water it's their path to go forward with
 
02:19:20.479 --> 02:19:21.509 align:start position:0%
water it's their path to go forward with
that

02:19:21.509 --> 02:19:21.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
some things were um done wrong she had
 
02:19:26.190 --> 02:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
it dismissed on her she was locked out
 
02:19:28.309 --> 02:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
the rid of possession I'd also like to
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
remind you when um the person spoke
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
about tenants not paying rent soon as
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
you a victim once you go to court and
 
02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
you argue for a discretionary stay
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
there's a thing called pay to stay you
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't pay you don't stay you don't pay
 
02:19:43.389 --> 02:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
they go to court and they move to get
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
the rid of possession it may take 2 to
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
three weeks for that to actually happen
 
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
but they're going to be out of there
 
02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting their money to stay and
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
commonly it also includes the amount of
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
back rent that is owed to the
 
02:19:57.950 --> 02:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
landlord um Miss margus I'm going ask
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
you to wrap up if you could yes
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
sir um so many landlords um I can't
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
speak to why they do
 
02:20:12.150 --> 02:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
it um hold on there there's one last
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
thing if I can pick just one last thing
 
02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
oh the biggest thing there is no safety
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
net for those who are disabled or
 
02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
elderly none whatsoever I have watched
 
02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Elliot Barry argue for a client that
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
had just recently had brain surgery
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't walk up her steps was
 
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
discriminated against herass and it was
 
02:20:33.309 --> 02:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
a retell eviction he fought to keep her
 
02:20:35.550 --> 02:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
in there and it was very hard but it was
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
the laws that are in place such as the
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
ones we have now that keep these tenants
 
02:20:42.429 --> 02:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
protected and in their homes and they're
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
there because sometimes they're not done
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
correctly sometimes they're used as
 
02:20:49.070 --> 02:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
retaliation and it's there to be able to
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
spot it stop it it and do the right
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
thing thank you thank you Miss gagy
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to add some
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
quicker hi my name is Rachel Gagney and
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
I live in
 
02:21:02.510 --> 02:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um I'm here to speak on
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
hb60 myself I was here last year about
 
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
it and um to me that law if you pass it
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
you're just going to cause more problems
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
because you're going to end up with more
 
02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
homeless people than you do now because
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
the landlord is going to use it like
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
like a weapon okay it's going to be very
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
easy very access accessible to them that
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to end up with more people
 
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
out on the street because what happens
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
every time you get evicted that gets put
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
on your record and it's like a like a um
 
02:21:43.469 --> 02:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
a bad scar that you cannot get rid of
 
02:21:46.990 --> 02:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
right and every time my landlord sees a
 
02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
new scar they're not going to want to
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
talk to you they just going to push you
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
aside till eventually you just end up
 
02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
with nothing nobody's going to want to
 
02:22:00.429 --> 02:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
talk to you no you give you a chance to
 
02:22:03.070 --> 02:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
look at a place just because you have
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
that scar on your record you know and it
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's not right it's not fair especially
 
02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
if you didn't do
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
anything I got evicted for renovation I
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
didn't do nothing wrong it took me 2
 
02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
years to find the place that I had have
 
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
now and it needs maintenance work
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
landlord won't do anything
 
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
the real estate company don't do
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
anything but you pass this law My Le
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
gets comes to an end next
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
march they could easily just kick me out
 
02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
just cuz I complained that my heat
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
stopped working during the course of the
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
winter it stopped when the temperature
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
dropped really bad it stopped working I
 
02:22:52.349 --> 02:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
was just lucky I had space heaters I
 
02:22:55.469 --> 02:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
could use they've yet to fix it the
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
Plumbing's all screwed up they've yet to
 
02:23:00.429 --> 02:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
fix that so come next march if I keep
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
complaining about it you pass this law
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
they can evict me then what do I
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
do I can't do
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
nothing it took took me two years the
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
first time to find an apartment how long
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
is it going to take me this time you
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
know what I mean you can't do that it's
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
not fair not for fair at all for any
 
02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
tenant it's I'm disabled my husband's
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
disabled I got my granddaughter with me
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's 13 she's she's handicapped
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
herself so it's even harder for the
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
three of
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
us you know so a normal
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
person they might have a little bit
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
more easier but for us it'd be even
 
02:23:52.510 --> 02:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your testimony are
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
there questions for these two
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
witnesses seeing none thank you very
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
much I hope I gave you enough time go
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
ahead can I add something really quick
 
02:24:05.309 --> 02:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
that I forgot I find it really ironic
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
since I told you I like to um add to
 
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
what was said while I was sitting there
 
02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:11.319 align:start position:0%
waiting for my turn and someone
 
02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that developers um are not
 
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
very incentivized I actually got an
 
02:24:17.309 --> 02:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
email from a developer that's trying to
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
do a project in Manchester seeing if
 
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
there's anything new out there as
 
02:24:23.070 --> 02:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
incentives that's how much they're
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
looking forward to developing that I got
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
that message while I was sitting here
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
during this thank you thank
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
rman thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:44.600 align:start position:0%

of whether or not a supreme court state
 
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court uh case decided in
 
02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
2005 uh was decided correctly I'm not
 
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
going to weigh in on the legal argument
 
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to speak briefly about um
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
the housing market that we are in uh and
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
what we know about it as a Housing
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
Organization that actively researches uh
 
02:25:29.269 --> 02:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
the state of the housing market um and
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
issues like um annual rental costs and
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
changes in costs um Supply uh factors um
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and numerous other characteristics
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
of the housing market so you've heard
 
02:25:45.630 --> 02:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
already the market we're in right now is
 
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
very tight we did a housing needs
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
assessment a couple years back and it
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
found that by 20 by
 
02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
2030 the state will need 60,000 new
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
units of housing to meet the state's
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
housing needs by 2040 we will need
 
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
990,000 new units of
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
housing we're not building enough units
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
of housing to hit those numbers if we
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
look at the number of building permits
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
issued over the last five decades we see
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
that in the mid
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
1980s there were roughly 18,000 build
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
permits issued per year in the Years
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
2000 through 2005 that number was around
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
8,000 and even though that was um a
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
sharp reduction from what we had seen in
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
the mid 80s when we look at the last uh
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
five years well actually 2018 to
 
02:26:42.830 --> 02:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
2023 um we are now building just over
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
4,000 units per
 
02:26:47.790 --> 02:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
year um other speakers have mentioned
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the vacancy rate for rentals is
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
very low it's below 1% I just want to
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
note that economists generally consider
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
a housing market to be inbalance um for
 
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
there to be fairly um uh equal uh Market
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
power between landlords and tenants um
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of a market exists when there
 
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
is a 5% vacancy
 
02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
record vacancy rate sorry um and we
 
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been there for for quite some
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
time so um we do know that there's an
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
imbalance right now
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the landlords uh unit owners uh have
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
most of the power for renters the the
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
market is um in a word brutal there are
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
very few units available uh and what
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
that means in in Practical effects and
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
again people have already said this um
 
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
so I will get through this very quickly
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
um if you lose an apartment in today's
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
market there's a substantial risk you
 
02:27:46.309 --> 02:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
will have trouble finding a new
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
apartment or finding the financial
 
02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
resources to rent a new apartment and
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
therefore there's a substantial
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
likelihood that you will become homeless
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the market we're seeing those
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
are the practical impacts that that
 
02:27:59.230 --> 02:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
we're aware of and I thank you very much
 
02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
for your time and attention for the past
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
two and a quarter hours thank you Mr
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
rman questions seeing none thank
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
Horan hey everyone my name is Marta
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
heran um a few people have said they're
 
02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
not lawyers good news I am so if you
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
have questions about the legal process
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer them I'll be very
 
02:28:22.510 --> 02:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
brief I work at New Hampshire legal
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
assistance I'm a housing attorney we
 
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
represent tenants occasionally landlords
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
it um and I just want to briefly explain
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit that when I go into court
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
what I tell tenants and most tenants
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't have a lawyer but when they have
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
me what I tell them is um you're in a
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
tough spot already as a tenant but if
 
02:28:42.269 --> 02:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
your landlord has good cause they also
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
have to prove it to a judge that it's a
 
02:28:46.670 --> 02:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason and with this if this
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
law passes what's going to happen is if
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
people are outside their lease term
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
which many tenants are at this point I
 
02:28:53.389 --> 02:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
would say most tenants their lease
 
02:28:54.990 --> 02:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
expires and if they remain on as
 
02:28:56.910 --> 02:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tenants and they go into
 
02:28:58.830 --> 02:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
court and they say I complained about my
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
heat like we just heard from another
 
02:29:02.349 --> 02:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
tenant or I have children that are loud
 
02:29:03.870 --> 02:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
or I have a mental disability that makes
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
people uncomfortable and if I say has
 
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
your lease expired and they say yes I'm
 
02:29:10.990 --> 02:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
going to say too bad this eviscerates
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
that retaliation argument this
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
eviscerates whatever you know good cause
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
we may have to pursue that this is not a
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
legitimate eviction because the judge
 
02:29:21.630 --> 02:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
will say you know I'll say you know
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
judge this tenant complained about her
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
heat two months later she got an
 
02:29:26.830 --> 02:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
eviction notice a week later she got an
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
eviction notice when her children were
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
too loud for the people below her and
 
02:29:31.230 --> 02:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
the judge will say has your lease
 
02:29:35.349 --> 02:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
expired yes the end you know the end it
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if you complain about
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
your heat it doesn't matter if your
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
children were loud it doesn't matter if
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're in an interraci interracial
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
relationship what matters to a judge if
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
this law passes is has your lease
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
expired that will be the end of the
 
02:29:51.150 --> 02:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
eviction hearing cuz what else is there
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
so you haven't paid your rent why would
 
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
anyone bring an eviction notice for that
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
you get an eviction notice sooner but
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
with this you don't have to prove
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
anything it's not hard to evict people
 
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this is what I tell our
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
tenants as well if your landlord is
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
motivated and you're outside your lease
 
02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
term you will be evicted it's not hard
 
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
okay they want to increase your rent to
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
something you can't afford they want to
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
take it off the market no one has to be
 
02:30:16.349 --> 02:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
a landlord in New Hampshire you're going
 
02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
to court and tell a judge I don't want
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
to be a landlord anymore great rid of
 
02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
possession you're going to go and tell I
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
want my aunt to move in okay rid of
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
possession they can't pay the rent rid
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
of possession they're making my neighbor
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable rid of possession it's not
 
02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
hard the only thing we have right now is
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
to prove to a judge that this is
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
retaliatory this is discrimination and
 
02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
we've made a lot of work in New
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make it so that tenants
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do that right now
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
and if you pass this law what am I
 
02:30:46.349 --> 02:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to do as an attorney what am I
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to tell tenants here here that
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
will be the the convers we have when
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
people apply for our services has your
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
lease expired there is nothing we can do
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
for you period and I'm happy to take any
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you attorney hjan our
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:31:05.469 --> 02:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
kwin hi thank you chair um
 
02:31:07.309 --> 02:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn when he was up here
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
he said that with
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
hb60 that a tenant who had paid the rent
 
02:31:13.870 --> 02:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
and stayed for years with permission of
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
the landlord could be evicted with no
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
cause um and that means that a tenant
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
who had done everything right um up till
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
then could end up with an eviction on
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
the record how much harder would an
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
eviction on a record make it for someone
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
to find housing especially in this very
 
02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
tight Market I mean it makes it it makes
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
it impossible I mean a lot of the work
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
we do now if we interview a client and
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
think there's legitimate reasons for
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
eviction that they haven't paid their
 
02:31:38.950 --> 02:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
rent or that the landlord actually
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
intends to renovate most of what we do
 
02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
right now is negotiate move out
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
agreements for the exact reason you
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
articulated that if you go into court
 
02:31:47.030 --> 02:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
and are evicted even if it's for
 
02:31:49.349 --> 02:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
renovation for no fault of your own to
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
apply to the next apartment and have to
 
02:31:52.590 --> 02:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
check the box on the application that
 
02:31:54.590 --> 02:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
says I've been evicted that's usually
 
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the conversation with a
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
prospective landlord we tell people you
 
02:31:59.950 --> 02:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
can advocate for yourself and explain
 
02:32:02.269 --> 02:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
the reason but I mean in this rental
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
market you know it basically makes it
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
impossible so a lot of our job already
 
02:32:08.910 --> 02:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
is negotiating move out agreements
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what we do to
 
02:32:11.750 --> 02:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
preserve people's housing Choice
 
02:32:13.630 --> 02:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
vouchers and to make it possible for
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
them to find another rental apartment my
 
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
job as a lawyer right now is usually
 
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
delivering bad news and negotiating move
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
out of agreements and I'm and I
 
02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
represent you know New Hampshire legal
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
is represents you know 1% of tenants in
 
02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the vast majority don't
 
02:32:29.309 --> 02:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
have our help at all and they will go
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
into court and get a and get an eviction
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
judgment on their rental history which
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
isn't like a criminal history but it's
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
what most landlords rely on in this
 
02:32:38.110 --> 02:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
tight Market to find their next
 
02:32:40.990 --> 02:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
tenant represent Paige thank you Mr
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to make sure I'm
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
understanding clearly um because we've
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about retaliation
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that you're here to
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard several examples of
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
people expressing concern about sort of
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
an underlying reason for the eviction
 
02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
right um sort of a covert reason whether
 
02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
that's talking about something not
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
working in the
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
apartment uh you know a denied unwanted
 
02:33:10.269 --> 02:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
sexual advance from the landlord any
 
02:33:12.269 --> 02:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
kind of you know discrimination based on
 
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
a protected
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
class so if I'm hearing you
 
02:33:20.429 --> 02:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
correctly my understanding is basically
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
there will be no point in trying to
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
prove that that eviction is retaliatory
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
should this law come into place as a
 
02:33:32.910 --> 02:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner weekly in New Hampshire
 
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
district courts doing landlord tenant
 
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
law thank you for question repres page
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
that would be my assumption of how this
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
law would function in practice if a
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
tenant is outside their lease term or
 
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
their lease has expired if they're
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
currently in a six-month lease which
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
don't exist at this point which may at
 
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
this if those law passes unfortunately
 
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
but let's say they're in a 12mon Le I
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
would argue that there's still a need to
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
be good cause like non-payment of rent
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
they violate a lease term there's
 
02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
adverse behavior and if a landlord had
 
02:33:59.469 --> 02:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
to prove one of those reasons I think it
 
02:34:01.230 --> 02:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
would raise the opportunity for a tenant
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
or their attorney to raise the prospect
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
that this is retaliatory for one of the
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
reasons you articulated like raising a
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
concern about a code violation or other
 
02:34:11.269 --> 02:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
discriminatory reasons however if a
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
tenants lease has expired and they're
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
being evicted for lease expir you know
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
their the lease has expired I don't see
 
02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
how a tenant could really articulate
 
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
this this is retaliatory because if this
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
is quote unquote just contract law how
 
02:34:25.950 --> 02:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
can you retaliate for the end of a
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
contract right so I think if this law
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
goes into effect what a district court
 
02:34:30.750 --> 02:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
judge is going to say they'll have a new
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
form on their box that they check when
 
02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
they do these judgments is has the lease
 
02:34:36.429 --> 02:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
expired and is that the reason for the
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
eviction how could you say this is
 
02:34:40.030 --> 02:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
because I complained about the rent
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
because the the judge is going to say
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
well under RSA 542 you know parentheses
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
J if the lease has expired that's good
 
02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
cause for eviction what further inquiry
 
02:34:50.429 --> 02:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
would I need to make to determine if
 
02:34:52.190 --> 02:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
there's lawful grounds for eviction
 
02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
because this reason has been clearly
 
02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
articulated in this new statute so I
 
02:34:57.269 --> 02:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
don't see how retaliation could be a
 
02:34:58.750 --> 02:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
successful defense to something that's
 
02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
quote unquote just the end of a contract
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
I as a practitioner I don't see how that
 
02:35:04.269 --> 02:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
would be a successful argument in the
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
vast majority of district courts and may
 
02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
have to go up to the Supreme Court to
 
02:35:08.590 --> 02:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
articulate some sort of way that could
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
be successful but as someone who
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
practices these cases currently I see no
 
02:35:14.349 --> 02:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
path forward for retaliation once El
 
02:35:16.990 --> 02:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
leas has expired under this current law
 
02:35:20.429 --> 02:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Daxton
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
this was interesting
 
02:35:26.190 --> 02:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
so you and this has come up before but
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
where is this eviction record I I'm I've
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
been a landlord for almost 35 years in
 
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
this state and there is is there the you
 
02:35:37.870 --> 02:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times an eviction
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
record I don't know where that would be
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
can you tell me yeah that's a great
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
question so unlike criminal records
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
which um are you know federal and state
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
records that someone can request if
 
02:35:49.309 --> 02:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
someone signs a release there is no
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
quote unquote eviction record as as
 
02:35:55.070 --> 02:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
people use it colloquially there are
 
02:35:57.190 --> 02:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
certain private websites like landlord
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
connection or other private websites
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
that a lot of landlords use they either
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
use landlord reporting or sometimes they
 
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
scrub court records to try to find what
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
are often perhaps inaccurate summaries
 
02:36:11.269 --> 02:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
of whether tenants have been evicted or
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
not more commonly I think the way I I
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
use the term eviction record in talking
 
02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
to our clients and tenants is when you
 
02:36:18.910 --> 02:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
apply for an apartment almost all
 
02:36:20.590 --> 02:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
applications will say have you been
 
02:36:23.230 --> 02:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
evicted or not so that question in sense
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
is your tenant record you could lie and
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
say no and hoping that no one ever
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
figures it out but there is a way they
 
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
could because it's a public court record
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
so anyone can go into a district court
 
02:36:34.670 --> 02:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
or call the court Paul Center and say
 
02:36:36.750 --> 02:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
hey has Mar hon ever had an eviction
 
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
case and by law that's a public record
 
02:36:40.830 --> 02:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
and they would tell the landlord yes or
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
no Mart Heron has had an eviction
 
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
judgment against so there are ways that
 
02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
tenant landlords can verify whether
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
tenants are being honest about whether
 
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
they're evicted or not because those are
 
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
all public records in New Hampshire and
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
kept by the court system followup yes
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
well given all right that makes sense
 
02:37:01.630 --> 02:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
okay but this law doesn't the way this
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
is being you're discussing this is that
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
somehow this mandates an eviction if I
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a tenant and I send them 60 days
 
02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
notice of termination and they go and we
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't go to court that's not an eviction
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's just termination of
 
02:37:19.269 --> 02:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
tency well just as if a tenant gave me
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
no notice and said hey I'm my lease is
 
02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
up on March 31st and I'm out of here so
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes and no as always the law is is
 
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
slightly more complicated I suppose than
 
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
that if a tenant leaves before the
 
02:37:33.990 --> 02:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
eviction notice expires many landlords
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
do not pursue the eviction in District
 
02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
Court because they already have
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
possession of the apartment the issue in
 
02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
a district court landlord tenant
 
02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
eviction hearing is who gets to possess
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
the apartment however this doesn't
 
02:37:46.830 --> 02:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
change the judicial process in New
 
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if a tenant gets an eviction
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
notice because their lease has expired
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
and they remain in the apartment which
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to do by law after the
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
eviction notice has expired the landlord
 
02:37:59.550 --> 02:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
under this law still has to take the
 
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
tenant to court file the court CA this
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
another reason I would say this saves
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
the landlords no money because you still
 
02:38:07.150 --> 02:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
have to take a tenant to court to evict
 
02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
them in New Hampshire whether it's
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
because their lease has expired or
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
because they didn't pay their rent so I
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
would say this doesn't really save
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
landlord's money it doesn't necessarily
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
make landlord's life easier as far as
 
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
the eviction process goes because they
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
still need to file the judicial process
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
and get a judgment against a tenant
 
02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
before they can lawfully remove them
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
from the property I'm sorry but I yep
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
real quick so this law says provided
 
02:38:31.389 --> 02:38:31.399 align:start position:0%
that the landlord has provided the
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
tenant with a written notice of at least
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
60 days in advance of the termination of
 
02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
date of the lease term that the lease
 
02:38:39.269 --> 02:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
will not be renewed and that the tenant
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
must vacate the rental property at the
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
end of the lease term why would I need
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
to go to court well if you read my my
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
former colleague Elliott Barry gave you
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
the RSA 540 statute if you read the rest
 
02:38:51.389 --> 02:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
of the statute there are certain
 
02:38:53.070 --> 02:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
processes that the landlord must follow
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
with giving a written eviction notice
 
02:38:57.150 --> 02:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
served in hand with a proper amount of
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
notice upon expiration of this isn't an
 
02:39:01.389 --> 02:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
eviction notice this is a notice of
 
02:39:04.269 --> 02:39:04.279 align:start position:0%
termination I mean what you're proposing
 
02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
would completely officer all of oursa
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
540s so I hope that's not representative
 
02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
just if you could just ask a question if
 
02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
you have one my understanding I'm not
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be argumentative but
 
02:39:17.710 --> 02:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this would simply
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
add another reason for eviction under
 
02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 542 but the rest of the statute in
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 540 as part as far as how you serve
 
02:39:29.230 --> 02:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
the court process would remain in effect
 
02:39:32.110 --> 02:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
so this would simply be another easier
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
potentially reason that a landlord could
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
put on the eviction notice but the rest
 
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the statute would remain in his
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
effect as far as the procedure that the
 
02:39:41.950 --> 02:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
landlord would have to follow that's my
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of reading this Statute in
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the rest of RSA 540 uh
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative Howland I'll be super
 
02:39:51.469 --> 02:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
sucin um you brought up you said that
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of renters are actually on
 
02:39:56.429 --> 02:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month lease they're not on a
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
or a month to they're leases expired
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
they're on month-to month they're not on
 
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
a formalized lease is that correct my my
 
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
my anecdotal experience is that most
 
02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
people sign a 12-month lease and then
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
once that lease expires this isn't
 
02:40:11.550 --> 02:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
always the case some landlords and
 
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
tenants are very on it and as soon as
 
02:40:15.550 --> 02:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
that lease expires they do another one
 
02:40:17.110 --> 02:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
another 12-month lease usually with a
 
02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
slight rent increase right but a lot of
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
time tenant the lease expires in
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
February the landlord or property
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
manager has a lot of other properties
 
02:40:25.870 --> 02:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
and as we've heard today in New
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the laws you just convert to a
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tency all the prior lease
 
02:40:32.110 --> 02:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
terms remain in effect really the only
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
thing that's lost when you become a
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tenant is the ability for
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
your landlord to increase the rent with
 
02:40:39.550 --> 02:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
30 days written notice so I I wouldn't
 
02:40:42.349 --> 02:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
say all um you know people are in a
 
02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tency but I think
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
especially for a tenant that has been in
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
a property for a fair amount of time a
 
02:40:49.070 --> 02:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
year two years three years at a certain
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
point point you know everyone's happy
 
02:40:52.269 --> 02:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
with how things are going hopefully and
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
they become a month-to-month tenant or
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lapse between when
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
the lease has expired oh yeah I forgot
 
02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
that Joe Smith in apartment C hasn't
 
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
done a lease yet and maybe five or six
 
02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
months later they they didn't they
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
negotiate a new lease but a lot of
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
people are in month-to-month tencies and
 
02:41:09.030 --> 02:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
as rep represent Lynn testified and I
 
02:41:10.590 --> 02:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
would agree under the the way the
 
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
statute is written and as represent kin
 
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
has um pointed out through some
 
02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
questioning you could become a
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tenant and be a
 
02:41:18.030 --> 02:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tenant for years and then
 
02:41:19.389 --> 02:41:19.399 align:start position:0%
you could get an eviction notice to
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
remember when your lease expired back in
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
2014 yeah we're good now we're going
 
02:41:26.190 --> 02:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
forward on that so it it it just takes
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
away that um you know there's no
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
obligation for anyone just like there's
 
02:41:30.590 --> 02:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
no obligation for anyone to be a
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
landlord no obligation for anyone to be
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
under a lease in New Hampshire um so I
 
02:41:35.630 --> 02:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people are in
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
month-to-month tencies and this could
 
02:41:39.830 --> 02:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
come as a complete surprise that a this
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
is a reason they can be evicted and B
 
02:41:43.309 --> 02:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
it's because their leas expired four
 
02:41:43.319 --> 02:41:44.950 align:start position:0%
it's because their leas expired four
years

02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
ago representative
 
02:41:48.990 --> 02:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
question is there since you're a lawyer
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
I've been waiting for a lawyer to come I
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
mean Mr Barry was here and I I didn't
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
take the
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity um we're hearing a lot about
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
how honorous it is to be a landlord how
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
terrible and and very put upon they are
 
02:42:08.670 --> 02:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if you know of
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
any law since you're a lawyer that
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
forces landlords to rent out units in
 
02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
this current legal environment where
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
they would have to honor a good tenant
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
past the the lease and that it being
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
part of the actual contract I I would
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
say I'm aware of No Such law and again
 
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh Elliot Barry passed out the current
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
eviction statute along with the current
 
02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
eviction form the administrative office
 
02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
of the courts makes it very
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
straightforward for people to understand
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
and follow the eviction process there
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
are free legal forms for the eviction
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
notice free forms for the demand for
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
rent um these cases happen quickly by
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
law hearings are scheduled within 10
 
02:42:44.910 --> 02:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
days if someone is facing an eviction
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
for a reason like non-payment of rent or
 
02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
adverse Behavior which is a 7-Day notice
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
itions can can happen within 3 to four
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
weeks I think it would be incredibly
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
inaccurate to say the majority of these
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
take a year six months the the most the
 
02:42:59.630 --> 02:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
longest time when we usually see is is
 
02:43:01.469 --> 02:43:01.479 align:start position:0%
two to three months depending on the uh
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
reason for the notice most happen within
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh four
 
02:43:10.269 --> 02:43:10.279 align:start position:0%
weeks yep thank you Mr chair um so what
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing and if you can the question
 
02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
is for you to confirm this that uh while
 
02:43:18.190 --> 02:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
there is no law and therefore landlords
 
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
are not forced to to be landlords or
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
rent out anything if the legal situation
 
02:43:25.469 --> 02:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
is not favorable or profitable for them
 
02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
people don't have a choice as to whether
 
02:43:30.630 --> 02:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
or not they need housing is that
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
accurate unfortunately in New Hampshire
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer I would say there's no right
 
02:43:37.469 --> 02:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
to housing anywh follow up last
 
02:43:41.309 --> 02:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
yep and uh last question in all of your
 
02:43:45.630 --> 02:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
experience with um representing tenants
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
against landlords how often were
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
landlord willing to negotiate what we
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
would consider I guess unusual terms of
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
their lease like you can stay here for
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
five years or 10 years or um anything
 
02:44:02.349 --> 02:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
else that wouldn't be how often did your
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
your clients to put another way feel
 
02:44:06.670 --> 02:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
empowered to make that that kind of
 
02:44:09.150 --> 02:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
negotiation obviously we see a small
 
02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
slice of of what uh most tenants in New
 
02:44:13.950 --> 02:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire face I've been a litigator for
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
12 years in the courts of New Hampshire
 
02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
I've done housing law for about five
 
02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
years I've never seen a lease longer
 
02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
than 12 months ever I've never seen at
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
least longer than 12 months I never
 
02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
spoken to any client who had at least
 
02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
longer than 12 months I've represented
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
hundreds of tenants at this point um I
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
would say the vast majority or anyone
 
02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
I've represented is 12 months or month a
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
month representative Gibs did you have a
 
02:44:38.349 --> 02:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:44:40.349 --> 02:44:40.359 align:start position:0%

um I'm a member of the academic Justice
 
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
mission team from the United Church of
 
02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
Christ New Hampshire conference and I'm
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of our group to speak
 
02:45:25.269 --> 02:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
um we the United Church of Christ is
 
02:45:30.309 --> 02:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
formerly known as congregationalists and
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
we represent um 140,000 congregants in
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
the state economic Justice is really
 
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
important to us in our denomination and
 
02:45:42.910 --> 02:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
shelter is a basic human need and is a
 
02:45:45.870 --> 02:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
right um included in the Universal
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Human Rights even if it
 
02:45:49.790 --> 02:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
isn't considered right in the state of
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I've just going to try to
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
summarize a few things because a lot of
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
things that I have spoken about are in
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony that I submitted on the
 
02:46:03.070 --> 02:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
portal so you all have that
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
electronically um I think secure housing
 
02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
is really important to well-being of
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
people to have an address allows people
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
to apply for jobs to and services more
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
easily having housing is necessary to
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining health and hygiene so that
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
people are clean and ready to go to work
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
and school and feel secure in being a
 
02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
part of the community and to be
 
02:46:26.670 --> 02:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
self-reliant independent contributing
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
members of society people need a home
 
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
base for safety for protection from the
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
elements for freedom to personalize
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
their living space a place to care for
 
02:46:38.190 --> 02:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
their family proximity to work to be a
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
part of the community with neighbors
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
local schools and social groups um we've
 
02:46:48.190 --> 02:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
already heard about Elders families and
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh dis abled people as needing to have
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
house particularly needing to have
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
housing and if people are evicted I I
 
02:47:01.309 --> 02:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
think the landlord tenant um
 
02:47:04.110 --> 02:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
relationship is one of unequal power
 
02:47:06.910 --> 02:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
landlords having more power than tenants
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
um and so tenants are always going to
 
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
worry about whether their housing is
 
02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
secure and that means that they have to
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
put more energy into work into the
 
02:47:19.790 --> 02:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
stress of
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
being able to maintain their housing
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
then need to be able to focus on doing a
 
02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
good job um go doing well in school
 
02:47:30.630 --> 02:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
taking care of their
 
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
families um I they think that this bill
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
is bad for the New Hampshire economy
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
we've already heard about the housing
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
situation and the homelessness rate um
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
it does fall on municipalities to take
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
care of the Indigent and that further
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
stretch is uh local budgets um and it
 
02:47:55.070 --> 02:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
will cause increases in property taxes
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
which are already straining property
 
02:47:59.630 --> 02:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
owners and particularly those on fixed
 
02:48:02.670 --> 02:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
incomes so we do need to have solutions
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
to housing that don't exacerbate the
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
difficulties it's important to protect
 
02:48:11.230 --> 02:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
both the landlords and the tenants but I
 
02:48:13.309 --> 02:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would deteriorate
 
02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
the fabric of community for
 
02:48:17.309 --> 02:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you very much for your
 
02:48:17.319 --> 02:48:18.910 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you very much for your
testimony

02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:48:21.790 --> 02:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions say none thank you very much
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.630 --> 02:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
so my name is Wendy Santiago I reside in
 
02:48:59.469 --> 02:48:59.479 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire and I currently
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
rent from a privately owned apartment
 
02:49:03.150 --> 02:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
complex here in conquered New Hampshire
 
02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
I have lived there for um over a decade
 
02:49:09.309 --> 02:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
without any form of um retaliation or
 
02:49:13.870 --> 02:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
harassment until 2021 when this bill
 
02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
when this bill I'm assuming just today I
 
02:49:19.950 --> 02:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
learned started about that time frame um
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
I have been harassed by my management
 
02:49:26.349 --> 02:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
office they have um come to my apartment
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
complex they've listened through my
 
02:49:30.269 --> 02:49:30.279 align:start position:0%
doors they have tracked my coming my
 
02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
going they have harassed me about my
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
handicapped parking spot um recently in
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
2021 I relapsed in my cancer which
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
caused a significant disability I've had
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
doctor letter doctor notes multiple of
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
them sent to my management office
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
requesting that I should be on a first
 
02:49:48.790 --> 02:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
floor due to my disability on
 
02:49:50.910 --> 02:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
fortunately because they have denied
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
that claim and increased harassment
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
instead in hopes that I'd move out
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
because they have no reason to throw me
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
out um I've had to get legal aid which
 
02:50:01.389 --> 02:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
my attorney is present in this in this
 
02:50:01.399 --> 02:50:03.150 align:start position:0%
my attorney is present in this in this
room

02:50:03.150 --> 02:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:04.790 align:start position:0%
room
um

02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
so also um I feel that when I go to talk
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
about the Discrimination I've been told
 
02:50:13.429 --> 02:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
that um we don't accommodate people like
 
02:50:15.870 --> 02:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
your kind um maybe you need to go find
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
other apartments that do um this is a
 
02:50:20.349 --> 02:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
sheare form of
 
02:50:22.750 --> 02:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination this um experience has
 
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
directly violated my fundamental human
 
02:50:28.469 --> 02:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
rights especially the New Hampshire
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
human right laws that prohibit housing
 
02:50:34.110 --> 02:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on multiple aspects
 
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
um including disability and harassment
 
02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
um I also want to mention that has not
 
02:50:43.389 --> 02:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
yet been mentioned here is that the
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence uh grants me
 
02:50:48.910 --> 02:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
the right to pursue happiness life and
 
02:50:53.070 --> 02:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
Liberty unfortunately House Bill uh 6 UH
 
02:50:57.990 --> 02:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
60 um infringes on my rights to to life
 
02:51:00.349 --> 02:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
because housing uh secure housing is not
 
02:51:02.950 --> 02:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
a luxury as it's been kind of portrayed
 
02:51:05.469 --> 02:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
here by those who are for the bill um
 
02:51:08.110 --> 02:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
but it's a necessary for survival um the
 
02:51:12.269 --> 02:51:12.279 align:start position:0%
ability to write to Liberty this bill uh
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%

02:51:16.429 --> 02:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
allowing landlord to discriminate
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
against tenants based on abtory factors
 
02:51:22.229 --> 02:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
or any way they want to um this bill
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
also p uh refering on my rights to
 
02:51:27.790 --> 02:51:27.800 align:start position:0%

02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
foundation for building a a fulfillment
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
Life House Bill 60 jeopardizes the
 
02:51:34.229 --> 02:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
rights to create
 
02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
environments um infringes on the rights
 
02:51:40.630 --> 02:51:40.640 align:start position:0%

02:51:43.229 --> 02:51:43.239 align:start position:0%

02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
living arrangements even though I'm
 
02:51:47.469 --> 02:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
currently on Section 8 Housing and that
 
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
is why they don't want me there they
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
want the living working individual there
 
02:51:54.190 --> 02:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
and not according to her management
 
02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:56.760 align:start position:0%

degree in clinical mental health because
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
I see there's a crisis here this bill
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
will not only increase the crisis of
 
02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
mental health and housing as people will
 
02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
become homeless but also infringe on the
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
rights of um myself as well as my son
 
02:52:22.030 --> 02:52:22.040 align:start position:0%

Leadership that would not have been able
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
to happen if we were homeless I'm I also
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
would like to point out the factor that
 
02:52:39.870 --> 02:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't been said um we already have a
 
02:52:41.550 --> 02:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
crisis as we already talked about with
 
02:52:43.150 --> 02:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
the homeless situation we've already
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
talked about the employment situation
 
02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
and other things but we haven't talked
 
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
about the child protective crisis that
 
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have it is not illegal to be homeless
 
02:52:52.510 --> 02:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
and have children but it is illegal to
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
have your children living on the street
 
02:52:56.550 --> 02:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
and in a car with the homeless crisis
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
right now and shelters that are being
 
02:53:00.910 --> 02:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
filled vers both single and family
 
02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
shelters there going to be a very big
 
02:53:05.389 --> 02:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
increase of unnecessary children going
 
02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
into foster care in the simple aspect of
 
02:53:09.790 --> 02:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want you living here are we
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
willing to trade our dignity our uh
 
02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
direct um independent rights from our
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
rights from the Declaration of indep
 
02:53:20.469 --> 02:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
attendance are we willing to trade our
 
02:53:24.309 --> 02:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
children and to the foster care system
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
just because somebody doesn't want us
 
02:53:28.269 --> 02:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
living there for whatever reasons in my
 
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
case it's because I'm on Section 8
 
02:53:32.830 --> 02:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
Housing and I'm disabled and they don't
 
02:53:35.590 --> 02:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
want people like my kind living in their
 
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
apartment when I have never been late on
 
02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
rent I have never been evicted I've been
 
02:53:43.269 --> 02:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
there for over 13 years and even when I
 
02:53:45.630 --> 02:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
was in the hospital for over nine months
 
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
I still paid my rent and made sure it
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
was on time that says a lot more than
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
those who actually have jobs who have
 
02:53:55.309 --> 02:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
evictions and could have paid their rent
 
02:53:57.630 --> 02:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
I I have a very limited income and I
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
still made that but yet I'm still being
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
harassed to the point where basically
 
02:54:04.110 --> 02:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's just so I leave I'm not the only
 
02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
victim at my apartment complex there are
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
multiple victims that I know of most of
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
them fall in the category of um
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
race um income um and um children who
 
02:54:19.389 --> 02:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
might be too loud these are all the
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
people that I know um that have been
 
02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
victim of this particular management
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
office um they've and this is her
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
maladaptive pattern to use harassment as
 
02:54:32.429 --> 02:54:32.439 align:start position:0%
a way of forcing someone to leave um
 
02:54:33.670 --> 02:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
Miss Santiago I'm going to ask you to
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
wrap up if you could please thank you I
 
02:54:39.550 --> 02:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate your the time um so um I just
 
02:54:41.870 --> 02:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say um since I've had legal
 
02:54:43.950 --> 02:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
aid involved I was able to move within
 
02:54:47.229 --> 02:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
30 days um to a new apartment complex
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
which I was only given two weeks to move
 
02:54:52.510 --> 02:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
um she did uh make a way that I would
 
02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
have 30 days to move versus 14 days but
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
um in the aspect of Section 8 housing if
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
someone were to get evicted they only
 
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
have 30 days to find a place and it is
 
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult to find a place you will
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
lose your housing which would
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
increase the hardship for those who are
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
on certain incomes but since I've moved
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
I have been continuously harassed and
 
02:55:17.389 --> 02:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
the pictures that I asked for the quote
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
unquote damages to the other apartment
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
she has manipulated and falsified those
 
02:55:24.510 --> 02:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of those photos by transferring
 
02:55:26.190 --> 02:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
them into black and white changing the
 
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
dates and times Etc so but I'm going to
 
02:55:30.750 --> 02:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
be working that out with my attorney
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay any questions are there questions
 
02:55:34.150 --> 02:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:55:41.469 --> 02:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
for the question I thought it was really
 
02:55:43.870 --> 02:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
interesting that you brought up the
 
02:55:46.110 --> 02:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
right to life liberty and the pursuit of
 
02:55:48.910 --> 02:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
happiness um are you aware
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
that in some elements of the Housing
 
02:55:52.349 --> 02:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
Community there's a couple sayings one
 
02:55:55.229 --> 02:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
is in at least in Europe uh housing
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
first and the other one is housing is
 
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
health care because they tie it to the
 
02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
fact that if you lose your housing you
 
02:56:05.870 --> 02:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
lose everything else whether that is
 
02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
your your um hygiene personal hygiene
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
decreases your access to even getting a
 
02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
job decreases your access to healthcare
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
decreases your mental health gets worse
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
your physical health gets worse all of
 
02:56:20.349 --> 02:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
those things being entwined and all of
 
02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
those things impinging on your ability
 
02:56:24.910 --> 02:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
to live were you aware that there that
 
02:56:25.950 --> 02:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
that has already been highlighted and
 
02:56:27.630 --> 02:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
those are those sayings that exist for
 
02:56:29.870 --> 02:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
that reason um appears that there's a
 
02:56:31.469 --> 02:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
few questions there I'll answer them one
 
02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
at a time um I wasn't aware of the two
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh things at housing first and the other
 
02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
one that you mentioned um but I was
 
02:56:41.550 --> 02:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
aware that when you're evicted you lose
 
02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
all your dignity your ability to work
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
your ability to go to school your
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
ability to function and my my case I'm
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the hospital a lot I just got back
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
out of the hospital um December 31st
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
because of my cancer is in my immune
 
02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
system I don't fight well I will have
 
02:57:01.950 --> 02:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
immune therapy But to answer your
 
02:57:03.830 --> 02:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
question I didn't realize the other
 
02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
portion but I did realize the second
 
02:57:07.870 --> 02:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
half of your
 
02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much um thank
 
02:57:12.309 --> 02:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony Jane hey did you
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
want to I see her leaving the room did
 
02:57:17.030 --> 02:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
you want to testify you're next on the
 
02:57:19.389 --> 02:57:19.399 align:start position:0%
list next yes thank you for your
 
02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much for
 
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:26.229 --> 02:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
speak I have one more person after this
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
so think we're wrapping up just gonna
 
02:57:30.399 --> 02:57:32.790 align:start position:0%
so think we're wrapping up just gonna
give

02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:36.150 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:40.229 --> 02:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
um so uh my name is Jane hey and I live
 
02:57:43.389 --> 02:57:43.399 align:start position:0%
in Manchester in Ward one and this is
 
02:57:45.550 --> 02:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
really just my own testimony although I
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
do work with the Manchester housing
 
02:57:50.550 --> 02:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
Alliance and I think as you all know um
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're mostly concerned with having more
 
02:57:56.110 --> 02:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing but
 
02:57:58.750 --> 02:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn is trying to make
 
02:58:00.750 --> 02:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
this about contracts kind of legal
 
02:58:04.150 --> 02:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
issues with contracts and um I just ask
 
02:58:06.030 --> 02:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
you to not lose sight of the fact that
 
02:58:07.469 --> 02:58:07.479 align:start position:0%
it's really about
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
housing which everybody's mentioned that
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
and I I um I definitely believe it's
 
02:58:15.630 --> 02:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
going to make the evictions worse people
 
02:58:17.469 --> 02:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
are going to become homeless that
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to become homeless it's
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
really a burden on all of us who are
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because when people first
 
02:58:27.150 --> 02:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
become homeless or they're threatened
 
02:58:30.150 --> 02:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
with homelessness they turn to the local
 
02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:31.349 align:start position:0%
with homelessness they turn to the local
welfare

02:58:31.349 --> 02:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
02:58:33.870 --> 02:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
agencies who usually can't help them
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
very much or the homeless shelters which
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
we also
 
02:58:41.150 --> 02:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
support um so we're in the midst of a
 
02:58:44.110 --> 02:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and I just have no idea
 
02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
why you would vote on a bill that will
 
02:58:50.269 --> 02:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
make it worse I I mean in 5 years maybe
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
we'll get to a point of a 5% vacancy
 
02:58:55.710 --> 02:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
rate I would love to see that but at the
 
02:58:59.110 --> 02:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
moment um we're just um this is just
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
going increase the chances for people to
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
become evicted and endanger housing for
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
as people have said housing for seniors
 
02:59:06.960 --> 02:59:08.030 align:start position:0%
as people have said housing for seniors
the

02:59:08.030 --> 02:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
disabled um and I think it just points
 
02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:59:16.110 --> 02:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
fundamental dichotomy in the issue of
 
02:59:18.710 --> 02:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
housing itself where it's both business
 
02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
for people who own these buildings and a
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
private property right for them as they
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
attempt to rent them out but it's also
 
02:59:28.110 --> 02:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
they also agree when they take on this
 
02:59:31.150 --> 02:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
particular business to provide homes for
 
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
people and I think that we can't allow
 
02:59:35.790 --> 02:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
landlords to lose sight of the fact that
 
02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
they have a responsibility to people who
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
they're who they're providing homes for
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
so as people have said it threatens the
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
stability of communities it threatens
 
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
health of people who are being evicted
 
02:59:49.990 --> 02:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
and um I think I don't have a whole lot
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
else to add but I would take questions
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you are
 
02:59:57.229 --> 02:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
there questions for Miss he seeing none
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%

03:00:35.190 --> 03:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
little background up front I'll still
 
03:00:38.030 --> 03:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
try to keep it within time um so my name
 
03:00:40.150 --> 03:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
is is Chris Freeman um I wear a few
 
03:00:41.630 --> 03:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
different hats I have a full-time career
 
03:00:44.190 --> 03:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
in in corporate finance um I am also the
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
owner and executive manager of Bell
 
03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
Tower Property Management which I like
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
to use the word Boutique because it
 
03:00:51.229 --> 03:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
makes me sound fancy but it's a small uh
 
03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
real estate investment company based at
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
aen New Hampshire but we have footprint
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh along the Connecticut River Valley we
 
03:00:59.830 --> 03:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
have um couple properties in Lebanon New
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um we are under contract
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
to move into uh Walpole New Hampshire as
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
well um and then in addition to that uh
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
I also am a participant in the madok
 
03:01:13.710 --> 03:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
resource Alliance uh which is a
 
03:01:15.469 --> 03:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
coalition organized underneath the
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
umbrella of the madn United Way uh and
 
03:01:19.590 --> 03:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
partnership with the Community Loan Fund
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
and a coalition of banks nonprofits and
 
03:01:24.309 --> 03:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
businesses operating within the manok
 
03:01:26.550 --> 03:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
region um I want to be clear that today
 
03:01:28.070 --> 03:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm representing my own views I'm not
 
03:01:30.710 --> 03:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
representing the views of the MRA um I
 
03:01:31.710 --> 03:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
think we've agreed that there's going to
 
03:01:33.870 --> 03:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
be a lot of diversity in the different
 
03:01:36.030 --> 03:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
opinions of people within that group so
 
03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
I'll uh I'll preface everything that I
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
say with that um the other thing I want
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
to share as a little bit of background
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
is um the nature of my business so we
 
03:01:45.070 --> 03:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit Niche um we
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
specialize in furnished room rentals uh
 
03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
which we call co-living and so uh
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
typically what we'll do is we'll take
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know some of these bigger older
 
03:01:54.510 --> 03:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
Apartments four bedroom apartments and
 
03:01:56.590 --> 03:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
we will uh outfit them almost like it's
 
03:01:58.229 --> 03:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
an Airbnb so they're fully furnished
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
they include all utilities and services
 
03:02:02.510 --> 03:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
and then we we demise those properties
 
03:02:05.870 --> 03:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
on uh individual bedroom leases and um I
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of got into that uh facing my own
 
03:02:10.229 --> 03:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
challenges with the housing
 
03:02:12.190 --> 03:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
affordability issues in the area back in
 
03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
2016 where prices make you know the
 
03:02:17.309 --> 03:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
prices today look comparatively pretty
 
03:02:17.319 --> 03:02:18.429 align:start position:0%
prices today look comparatively pretty
horrible

03:02:18.429 --> 03:02:18.439 align:start position:0%
horrible
 
03:02:20.469 --> 03:02:20.479 align:start position:0%
um and the objective is to create a
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
market-based affordable alternative uh
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
for folks that are trying to navigate
 
03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
the the current housing environment um
 
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
with this being kind of a more
 
03:02:30.269 --> 03:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
affordable price point for folks than
 
03:02:31.630 --> 03:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
going and getting a studio or a
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom by themselves um we do have
 
03:02:38.630 --> 03:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
a tendency to work with uh candidates
 
03:02:40.590 --> 03:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
who might be viewed as marginal if they
 
03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
were going to be applying for a
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom apartment um particularly on
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
the basis of income uh as others have
 
03:02:50.469 --> 03:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
pointed out in in Keen one-bedroom
 
03:02:52.349 --> 03:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
apartment is $1,500 you need to make
 
03:02:55.150 --> 03:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
$4,500 a month to be able to afford that
 
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
we have furnished allinclusive rooms
 
03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
starting as low as you know 765 which if
 
03:03:01.710 --> 03:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
you're starting at Wendy's um you can
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
afford um so I'm going to try and kind
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
of go through a few quick points high
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
level if you could yeah um that'd be
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
great so uh let me see where do I want
 
03:03:11.120 --> 03:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
great so uh let me see where do I want
to

03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:15.229 --> 03:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
focus um generally speaking I'm in favor
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
of really strong property rights it's
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I choose to
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
invest and and keep all of our money in
 
03:03:22.150 --> 03:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh where we are positioned
 
03:03:23.710 --> 03:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
on the Connecticut River Valley we can
 
03:03:26.150 --> 03:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
very easily cross over into Vermont if
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
we decide that the housing regulations
 
03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
that are in Vermont are acceptable to us
 
03:03:32.190 --> 03:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
and whenever we consider that Prospect
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
we look at the strength of the property
 
03:03:35.670 --> 03:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
rates over there and we think about how
 
03:03:37.309 --> 03:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
would this affect our decisions when it
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
comes to approving rental applications
 
03:03:41.670 --> 03:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking my reaction is
 
03:03:43.150 --> 03:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
somebody that you know cares a lot about
 
03:03:45.469 --> 03:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
housing access is that we would have to
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
have tougher approval criteria in
 
03:03:49.750 --> 03:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont in order to protect our business
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
interests than what we're willing to
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
accept here in New Hampshire and that's
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
going to be a recurring theme throughout
 
03:03:56.670 --> 03:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
my testimony here today is that at the
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
end of the day an occupied rental unit
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
is fulfilling its function we don't have
 
03:04:03.429 --> 03:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
a problem here with major corporate
 
03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
ownership where you know people are
 
03:04:08.229 --> 03:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
holding empty units as landlords are our
 
03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
biggest potential expense is vacancy and
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're motivated to keep those units full
 
03:04:15.229 --> 03:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Freeman if you could you've already
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
gone five minutes so if you could that
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
was five wow it was must be Happ F all
 
03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:21.150 align:start position:0%
was five wow it was must be Happ F all
right

03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
um I I I view uh strong property rights
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
as giving landlords U more options to to
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
provide access we feel more comfortable
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
taking risks with marginal tenants when
 
03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
we know that we have recourse uh and
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
um I can't even read my own handwriting
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
so I guess I will oh the only other
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is that um I would
 
03:04:43.910 --> 03:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
question with with a new category for
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
eviction I try to put myself in the
 
03:04:47.830 --> 03:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
position I've had 180 tendencies in have
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
never had to go through the eviction
 
03:04:51.070 --> 03:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
process but if I were taking an
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
application from somebody that had an
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
eviction on their record I would be
 
03:04:56.510 --> 03:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
curious about the details of that and I
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
would think that seeing a an eviction
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
for end of lease would be a lot less
 
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
concerning to me as a category than an
 
03:05:04.990 --> 03:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
eviction for something like non-payment
 
03:05:06.590 --> 03:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
which is how that could end up unfolding
 
03:05:08.229 --> 03:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise okay thank you very much for
 
03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%

03:05:09.520 --> 03:05:10.389 align:start position:0%

03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
that I prime sponsoring and uh my very
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
first introduction and along those lines
 
03:06:34.830 --> 03:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
I want to take this opportunity briefly
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
to just uh Express to everybody here
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
that um I did watch the inauguration
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
last night and I thought it was a great
 
03:06:45.950 --> 03:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
ceremony uh we most of us I think had
 
03:06:48.910 --> 03:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
the day off and so I took advantage and
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
watched the whole thing and I thought it
 
03:06:52.110 --> 03:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
was great that we had a peaceful
 
03:06:55.150 --> 03:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
transition of power but um I bring that
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
up because there's also
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
um ideas and themes of uh unity and
 
03:07:03.229 --> 03:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
getting down and working hard and so in
 
03:07:06.229 --> 03:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
that respect starting uh a new term here
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm very excited to uh get to work for
 
03:07:11.030 --> 03:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
the public and make the state and the
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
country a better place uh with this
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
particular Bill there isn't too much of
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
a backstory with it essentially an
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
anonymous uh constituent came to me
 
03:07:24.510 --> 03:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
during my campaign for this race and
 
03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
suggested the idea I took it down in a
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
note and I ended up filing it and um I
 
03:07:33.550 --> 03:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
really didn't know what was going to
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
happen my bill HB
 
03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
351 what it does is address a current
 
03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
inequity in the law where if you are a
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
tenant at will and you want to leave
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
you must give your landlord 60-day
 
03:07:52.990 --> 03:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
notice and in a situation with the
 
03:07:56.349 --> 03:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
tenant at will If a landlord wants the
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
tenant to leave they're only required to
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
give 30-day notice my bill simply and
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
straightforward changes the 30-day on
 
03:08:07.630 --> 03:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
the landlord's side to 60 days to make
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
the same situation in alignment um
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
finally I would like to say that with
 
03:08:15.030 --> 03:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
this being my first bill that I'm
 
03:08:16.710 --> 03:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
introducing I really didn't know what
 
03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
was going to happen I've been checking
 
03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
my emails I haven't had much reach out
 
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
yet but looking at the blue signin sheet
 
03:08:28.429 --> 03:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm um very happy that uh the public
 
03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
who filled in that blue sheet uh 14 were
 
03:08:34.950 --> 03:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
for and two were against on last count
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
and based on my last look my blue sheet
 
03:08:40.349 --> 03:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
had the most participation on it so I'm
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
very happy about that and with that Mr
 
03:08:44.910 --> 03:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
chair I'll be happy to answer any
 
03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
questions that your committee has thank
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um are there
 
03:08:50.349 --> 03:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
questions for representative pataro
 
03:08:50.359 --> 03:08:52.229 align:start position:0%
questions for representative pataro
represent

03:08:52.229 --> 03:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:08:55.389 --> 03:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
Faxon did you you you actually found
 
03:08:58.150 --> 03:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
this in 540A because my understanding
 
03:09:01.349 --> 03:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
and my experience has always been that
 
03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
the uh notice required on an atwi tency
 
03:09:08.429 --> 03:09:08.439 align:start position:0%
is equal to the period in which the rent
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
is paid so if you're a weekly tenant
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
you're required to receive weekly notice
 
03:09:14.309 --> 03:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
and give weekly notice if you're a
 
03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
monthly tenant Etc is
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
and you you found something different
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
than that in
 
03:09:24.190 --> 03:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
548 I did not find anything in that
 
03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
regard um uh that's an interesting point
 
03:09:29.070 --> 03:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
though representative I'll be um happy
 
03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
to connect with you about that
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
one other questions seeing none thank
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
you representative thank
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
you um oh could you fill out a pink card
 
03:09:49.630 --> 03:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.229 --> 03:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for the opportunity
 
03:09:51.239 --> 03:09:51.990 align:start position:0%
thank you once again for the opportunity
to

03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:09:55.309 --> 03:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
speak uh I've given an introduction
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
previously um so I just want to say that
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know having been in real
 
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
estate for 35 years and managing the Min
 
03:10:08.190 --> 03:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
departments that I have it is not true
 
03:10:11.790 --> 03:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
that the law requires a 60-day notice
 
03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
from a tenant in fact RSA 540 colon 1
 
03:10:19.990 --> 03:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
comma Roman two specifies the tendency
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
at will from month to month may be
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
terminated by the lesi upon 30 days
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
notice and as Baxter representative
 
03:10:30.269 --> 03:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
Baxter quoted I think there are some
 
03:10:31.710 --> 03:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
additional Clauses that say if the
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
frequency is less it could be a weak if
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's a weak tendency that's that's been
 
03:10:38.429 --> 03:10:38.439 align:start position:0%
the the way that has been for forever
 
03:10:42.750 --> 03:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
and ever as far as I've I've known to
 
03:10:45.469 --> 03:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
this the place where this provision was
 
03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
put into the law does
 
03:10:51.630 --> 03:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
not make
 
03:10:55.309 --> 03:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
um notice for termination 60 days what
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it does is it increases
 
03:11:03.150 --> 03:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
evictions from 30 days to 60 days so it
 
03:11:06.349 --> 03:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
would say that every eviction cause
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's presently in the law that's
 
03:11:10.429 --> 03:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
presently 30 days would now become 60
 
03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
days so you have a tenant that's that's
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
um causing extreme disturbance someone
 
03:11:19.229 --> 03:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
that's endangering other
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
tenants um someone that's like the
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
classic thing we talk about about
 
03:11:26.389 --> 03:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
dealing drugs which oh my gosh it's so
 
03:11:28.990 --> 03:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
so often happens you would be subjecting
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
all of the other good tenants into the
 
03:11:32.229 --> 03:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
building of the building to an
 
03:11:35.910 --> 03:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
additional 30 days of trying to remedy
 
03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
that situation to provide good housing
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
for for people you take the current
 
03:11:41.359 --> 03:11:42.590 align:start position:0%
for for people you take the current
eviction

03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
process of a 30-day eviction which can
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
take about 9 to to 11 weeks and then add
 
03:11:51.870 --> 03:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
on another 30 days and now that becomes
 
03:11:56.670 --> 03:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
13 to 15 15 weeks um there's delays in
 
03:11:59.550 --> 03:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's service in the entire process
 
03:12:01.950 --> 03:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh right now as is a little delayed for
 
03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
eviction you could be talking three and
 
03:12:08.670 --> 03:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
a half months to eliminate a a bad
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
situation in a property where you have a
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
bad tenant causing Untold grief so we
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
oppose uh the change present law I think
 
03:12:20.910 --> 03:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
is totally fine each site can give a
 
03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:22.070 align:start position:0%
is totally fine each site can give a
30-day

03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
30-day
 
03:12:25.389 --> 03:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
notice contracts can be made uh through
 
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
leases that have other notices it's not
 
03:12:29.790 --> 03:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
uncommon that a housing provider would
 
03:12:31.550 --> 03:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
have a lease where they agree to a
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
60-day notice by the landlord and by the
 
03:12:37.710 --> 03:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
tenant but just to be clear the present
 
03:12:40.030 --> 03:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
law does not say a tenant has to give a
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
60-day notice present law is balanced
 
03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
with the landlord and tenant giving
 
03:12:48.510 --> 03:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
30-day notices unless there's a lease
 
03:12:50.110 --> 03:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
that says something different which is
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by both parties I'd be happy
 
03:12:55.150 --> 03:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
to take questions thank you Mr Norman
 
03:12:56.590 --> 03:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
three minutes and one second appreciate
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:13:00.429 --> 03:13:00.439 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:13:03.550 --> 03:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Norman for coming in to testify um
 
03:13:05.550 --> 03:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
this is a two-part question the first
 
03:13:08.070 --> 03:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
part is how many units do you manage and
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
the second part is how many times uh
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last few years
 
03:13:17.309 --> 03:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
say the last five years um have you you
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
had to evict a tenant for causing
 
03:13:23.710 --> 03:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
disturbances I have 48 units I've been
 
03:13:26.190 --> 03:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
managing for 35
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
years I definitely have tenants that
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
have caused disturbance and it's an
 
03:13:36.349 --> 03:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
issue and I have never evicted a tenant
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
for causing disturbance because when you
 
03:13:43.510 --> 03:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
go to court to try to process that
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
eviction you have to prove that case in
 
03:13:50.830 --> 03:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
course in court and it's virtually
 
03:13:53.229 --> 03:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
impossible not quite impossible but it's
 
03:13:56.309 --> 03:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
let's say it's very hard to get existing
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
good tenants to testify against a bad
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
tenant in the property because they're
 
03:14:04.790 --> 03:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
afraid of retaliation so
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
proving the case in court becomes
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
exceedingly difficult
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
so uh we
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
haven't U go ahead follow up
 
03:14:20.910 --> 03:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
just put your mic on for us thank you
 
03:14:20.920 --> 03:14:22.910 align:start position:0%
just put your mic on for us thank you
sorry

03:14:22.910 --> 03:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh in that case um
 
03:14:30.510 --> 03:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh I guess another two-part question how
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
did you handle those situations and what
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
difference would it make since you don't
 
03:14:38.309 --> 03:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
go through the eviction process what
 
03:14:40.469 --> 03:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
difference would it make to have to give
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
60 days notice rather than 30
 
03:14:46.469 --> 03:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
days so if you're not using a 30-day
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
then of course of course wouldn't make
 
03:14:49.790 --> 03:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
any difference but for the the property
 
03:14:52.990 --> 03:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
owners that do use 30-day evictions when
 
03:14:56.349 --> 03:14:56.359 align:start position:0%
there are many
 
03:15:01.389 --> 03:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
um it would extend the time by way way
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
way way too long why should you subject
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
good tenants to three and a half months
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
of misery living with someone that's
 
03:15:11.359 --> 03:15:13.269 align:start position:0%
of misery living with someone that's
causing

03:15:13.269 --> 03:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
causing
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
trouble representative
 
03:15:17.469 --> 03:15:17.479 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Norman um I'm just looking at the the
 
03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
03:15:25.150 --> 03:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
bill it says provided however that s
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
days notice shall be sufficient if the
 
03:15:28.269 --> 03:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
reason for the termination is a set
 
03:15:30.910 --> 03:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
forth in and then it references this
 
03:15:33.750 --> 03:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
part of Statute that gives several of
 
03:15:37.510 --> 03:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons us used as examples as cause
 
03:15:39.630 --> 03:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
for that 7-Day notice rather than the 60
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
days which include non-payment of rent
 
03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues structural damage so
 
03:15:48.269 --> 03:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
what um what the concern what with those
 
03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
examples off the table I'm not sure what
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
the concern is around moving it to 60
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
days so there's only a few cases where
 
03:16:03.510 --> 03:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
you can evict for the 7-Day notice one
 
03:16:03.520 --> 03:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
you can evict for the 7-Day notice one
is

03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:16:07.950 --> 03:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
non-payment one is excessive damage or
 
03:16:09.469 --> 03:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
concerns and the other is a tenant that
 
03:16:15.870 --> 03:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
is going through a lead abatement
 
03:16:18.710 --> 03:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
process where the tenant is ref has
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
refused to move so that the lead
 
03:16:22.990 --> 03:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
abatement can
 
03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
be um proceeded
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
with every other cause for eviction
 
03:16:34.349 --> 03:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
would be extended from 30 to 60 so let's
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
say you've got someone that's causing uh
 
03:16:41.229 --> 03:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
large disturbance to the property um
 
03:16:42.990 --> 03:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're selling
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
drugs uh all of those would be uh extend
 
03:16:51.150 --> 03:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
Ed to 30 from 30 to 60 you want your
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
daughter to move into an apartment
 
03:16:55.189 --> 03:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
because she's moving across country back
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
into this region it would be extending
 
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
the time that she would have to wait to
 
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
move in any cause at all that you could
 
03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
move in any cause at all that you could
think

03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:17:11.429 --> 03:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
three other questions see none thank you
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
03:17:21.309 --> 03:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
Cara an um rhen
 
03:17:23.469 --> 03:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
Heiser she has written testimony yeah
 
03:17:24.990 --> 03:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
the clerk will get that and we'll make
 
03:17:28.389 --> 03:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
Holland good afternoon I'm Sarah Holland
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh chair of public policy for the New
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors thank
 
03:17:47.710 --> 03:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
you for having us today
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
very similar to my testimony for hb60 um
 
03:17:56.030 --> 03:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
we are in opposition of HB 351 for the
 
03:17:59.189 --> 03:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
following reasons um the longer notice
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
requirement will likely increase the
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
chance that a tenant will not pay um
 
03:18:05.710 --> 03:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
rent for the last month or two I
 
03:18:07.830 --> 03:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
actually just worked with a a client
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
where that was the case he had two
 
03:18:13.070 --> 03:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
tenants and um we did not know that one
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
of them even vacated the pro property or
 
03:18:17.469 --> 03:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
was planning to vacate the property
 
03:18:19.469 --> 03:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
um so it happens for a variety of
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
reasons um Maine and Massachusetts our
 
03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
neighbors also um require a maximum 30
 
03:18:28.269 --> 03:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
days notice so we're staying in line um
 
03:18:30.670 --> 03:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
our current laws is in line with our
 
03:18:30.680 --> 03:18:32.269 align:start position:0%
our current laws is in line with our
neighbors

03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
um we would encourage tenants to sign
 
03:18:37.870 --> 03:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
leases as opposed to month to month we
 
03:18:39.389 --> 03:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
understand that that creates additional
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
hurdles for them as well um the
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
month-to-month is uncertain um but we
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
feel that the notice requirement should
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
equal the length of of at will tency so
 
03:18:54.429 --> 03:18:54.439 align:start position:0%
that 30 days um and again this is not
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
going to solve the housing crisis I
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
think what we need to do is look for
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
ways to add more inventory this is a
 
03:19:02.510 --> 03:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
supply and demand issue um there are a
 
03:19:04.990 --> 03:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
lot of tenants looking for um lot of
 
03:19:06.870 --> 03:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
renters that are looking for tency in a
 
03:19:08.910 --> 03:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
lot of places if we had more opportunity
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
for them to find housing that would
 
03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
alleviate a lot of this pressure where
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
landlords are as testimony showed today
 
03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
are greedy retaliatory um and
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
discriminatory so
 
03:19:25.389 --> 03:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
um I think I also want to be clear that
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
our position today is very narrow on
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
private property rights and Property
 
03:19:33.189 --> 03:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
Owners being able to um to take
 
03:19:35.070 --> 03:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
possession back of their property in a
 
03:19:37.870 --> 03:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
timely manner um we are not in favor of
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
discriminatory or retaliatory um actions
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
um and but we do wish to preserve
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
private property rights happy to answer
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for your
 
03:19:48.750 --> 03:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
testimony questions from the
 
03:19:51.710 --> 03:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
03:19:55.710 --> 03:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
much I will now call on I want make sure
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:06.510 --> 03:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
Klein thank you Mr chairman of the
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David cleus I said
 
03:20:10.670 --> 03:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
before I'm a small L Lord one of the
 
03:20:14.030 --> 03:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
mama pops with property on the coast I
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
want to start off with the if you go
 
03:20:17.550 --> 03:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
back to the test testimony of the
 
03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor he said that he proposed the
 
03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill because he was told by a
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
constituent that if they wanted to leave
 
03:20:28.910 --> 03:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
they had to give 60-day notice one
 
03:20:31.189 --> 03:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's not true Nick Norman gave you the
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
statutory reference RSA 540 not 548 5411
 
03:20:37.110 --> 03:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
where it does say the tenants only have
 
03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
to give 30-day notice which is the same
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
as a landlord so that this bill is not
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
what the sponsor is talking about this
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
bill talks about when there is a breach
 
03:20:51.790 --> 03:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the lease or someone believe it or
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
not they will not cooperate in the
 
03:20:56.469 --> 03:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
remediation of bed bugs which can spread
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
to the whole building that period of
 
03:21:01.189 --> 03:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
time is a 30-day notice extending that
 
03:21:04.750 --> 03:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
to 60 days you want to expose good
 
03:21:07.189 --> 03:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
tenants to the bad habits of a bad
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
tenant pass this bill we have to look at
 
03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
what it's going to do to the other
 
03:21:13.389 --> 03:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
people in the building none of us want
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
to live with bed bugs this gives this
 
03:21:17.429 --> 03:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
bad tenant more time to do nothing
 
03:21:18.950 --> 03:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
because you have to work at getting rid
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
of bed bugs another area where would
 
03:21:24.910 --> 03:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
extend is a material breach of the lease
 
03:21:26.830 --> 03:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
many of the apartments these days the
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
tenants are responsible for all utility
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
except for possibly water this means
 
03:21:36.750 --> 03:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
that if they stop paying heat or or fuel
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the landlord has two choices let the
 
03:21:41.030 --> 03:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
apartment go cold or pay for the heat to
 
03:21:43.950 --> 03:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
prevent it from freezing up I just think
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
about how cold it is today you don't
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
have heat you will freeze pipes those
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
pipes freeze and burst probably the
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
entire building will be taken out of
 
03:21:53.389 --> 03:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
line and all the tenants would have to
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
move that's a distinct possibility so
 
03:21:58.630 --> 03:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it doesn't help good
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
tenants it helps bad tenants and what
 
03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is don't change it
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill it's not doing what
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor wanted to be done and it's
 
03:22:10.110 --> 03:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be good for either
 
03:22:12.550 --> 03:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
landlords or good tenants who take care
 
03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities pay the rents
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't breach their leases thank you Mr
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
Klein are there questions for Mr Klein
 
03:22:28.510 --> 03:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
Mayberry welcome back hello once again
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
Matt Mayberry CEO of the New Hampshire
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
home builder Association please please
 
03:22:38.429 --> 03:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
please do not pass this bill the
 
03:22:40.630 --> 03:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences are Prett
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
substantial as you've just heard before
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
but if the committee insists upon doing
 
03:22:48.030 --> 03:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
it please put tenants in the boat with
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
the property providers if the property
 
03:22:52.750 --> 03:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
provider has to give 60 days the tenant
 
03:22:55.469 --> 03:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
has to give 60 days that's all we're
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
asking fairness that's it I think
 
03:23:00.990 --> 03:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr maybery seeing none
 
03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you 24 seconds I yeah just
 
03:23:07.229 --> 03:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
about um I'm acting as clerk too so I'm
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
Freeman all right should be able to keep
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
this one a little bit more concise I
 
03:23:19.630 --> 03:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
think some other folks have made some
 
03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
great points about the fact that this is
 
03:23:22.429 --> 03:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
how long it takes once you file the
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
eviction so we won't rehash that um I
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of continue on the
 
03:23:28.910 --> 03:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
theme of how we are different from other
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
conventional landlords in the shared
 
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
housing um if you extend the uh timeline
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
that it takes to complete an eviction
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
from 30 to 60 days in a shared housing
 
03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
environment then whatever bad behavior
 
03:23:42.830 --> 03:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
it is that is leading to that eviction
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
is something that's going to be imposed
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
on um in our case up to three other
 
03:23:49.389 --> 03:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
people uh for that whole 60-day period
 
03:23:50.910 --> 03:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I mentioned before we've we've had
 
03:23:53.469 --> 03:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
180 Tendencies zero evictions it usually
 
03:23:54.830 --> 03:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
works out pretty well if you ask them to
 
03:23:57.389 --> 03:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
leave in my experience um but we take
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
the the responsibility of maintaining a
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh constructive and positive living
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
environment Within These shared spaces
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
pretty seriously and I I think it would
 
03:24:07.710 --> 03:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
be pretty unfortunate if we found
 
03:24:11.790 --> 03:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves compelled to abide uh Behavior
 
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's not specifically um not
 
03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:16.790 align:start position:0%
that's not specifically um not
specifically

03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:24:18.429 --> 03:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
a health or safety per se but but
 
03:24:20.110 --> 03:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps a personality mismatch that's
 
03:24:22.229 --> 03:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
causing you mental anguish uh within a
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
shared living
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
space thank you for your testimony other
 
03:24:29.550 --> 03:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you all

thank you so much to the committee and
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
um first of all if you need to stand up
 
03:24:56.830 --> 03:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
and stretch while I'm testifying I take
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
no offense I know I've stood up and
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
stretch during some of the other
 
03:25:02.189 --> 03:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
testimony today um so thank you very
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
much for hearing my bill um I just want
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
to give you a little bit of background
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
if I may over um some point last summer
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
I had a meeting with Congressman Maxwell
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
Frost from the Orlando area of Florida
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
and he was talking about his experiences
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
um ultimately becoming homeless for a
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons while he was running
 
03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
for office um and the challenges that
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
came up as a result of that and he bemon
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that as a tenant he didn't have
 
03:25:30.269 --> 03:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
a way of increasing his credit score in
 
03:25:31.710 --> 03:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
the same way that a homeowner paying a
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage would and I stopped him and
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
said that's not accurate rental payments
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
are also can also be reported to credit
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
bureaus and he said no they only report
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
negative ones in other words when people
 
03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't pay and I said well you know high
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
quality landlords also report positive
 
03:25:50.950 --> 03:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
rent payments to the credit bureaus
 
03:25:52.710 --> 03:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
because they understand the benefit of
 
03:25:54.710 --> 03:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
helping people build their credit score
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
so after I completed that conversation
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
with him I reached out to um a number of
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
property managers that I know from my
 
03:26:03.710 --> 03:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
previous work as a real estate agent in
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the SE coast region of New Hampshire and
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
I asked them do you report ontime rent
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
payments to the credit bureaus and um of
 
03:26:14.510 --> 03:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
the ones that I spoke to several said
 
03:26:16.269 --> 03:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
yes one of them said that once they
 
03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
instituted that as a policy for the
 
03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
company they had a 95% ontime rental
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
payment rate and were chasing down far
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
fewer people for rent um which was
 
03:26:27.550 --> 03:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
saving them time and money as an
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
organization and so now they actually
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
have that written into their lease that
 
03:26:32.429 --> 03:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
they report all rent payments both on
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
time and late and as a result they have
 
03:26:36.229 --> 03:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
people paying very much on time their
 
03:26:38.110 --> 03:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
tenants are building their credit scores
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
and because that's a company that also
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
does property sales um when they turn
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
around and are able to then use their
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
higher credit scores to buy a property
 
03:26:46.710 --> 03:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
they've got a real estate AG agent built
 
03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
right in so it's helping them feed their
 
03:26:50.590 --> 03:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
own market for potential buyers and then
 
03:26:51.950 --> 03:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
they get new tenants and help them do
 
03:26:53.189 --> 03:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
the same kind of thing of building their
 
03:26:55.189 --> 03:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
credit score by paying their rent on
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
time so I proposed this bill um when I
 
03:27:01.469 --> 03:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
started working with some other people
 
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
it got a little bit more complicated
 
03:27:04.990 --> 03:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
than I had initially intended we modeled
 
03:27:07.309 --> 03:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
it after a bill in California and the
 
03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill has gotten expanded well beyond
 
03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
where I might have chosen to have it so
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
I've spoken again with the landlords
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
that I worked with previously and I
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I have to take my glasses off so I
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
can read um so essentially the property
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
managers that I spoke to said they would
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually like to strip out the language
 
03:27:26.229 --> 03:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
of this being an opin Bill instead they
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
would prefer if it were a landlords will
 
03:27:31.110 --> 03:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
either landlords shall do this or just
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
not have it at all um so that it's up to
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
the landlord to make a determination
 
03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
because it's very complicated if one
 
03:27:39.189 --> 03:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
tenant wants a credit reported and one
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't and trying to figure out how to
 
03:27:43.269 --> 03:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
manage that the ones that are using
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
professional software such as AppFolio
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
it's literally a toggle switch on their
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
software that allows them to just
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
automatically report credit scores as
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
they enter rent payments into their
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
database um so it doesn't add any extra
 
03:28:00.429 --> 03:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
cost um to their to their plans um so
 
03:28:03.150 --> 03:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
ideally we would uh make an amendment to
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
this bill that would reduce it down to
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
the essential thing that landlords and
 
03:28:08.790 --> 03:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm talking about professional
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
landlords so I said in the bill 15 or
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
more properties we can make that number
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you think is appropriate but
 
03:28:17.550 --> 03:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
that landlords will report positive rent
 
03:28:21.389 --> 03:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
payments to the credit bureaus um and
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
just keep it that simple that would be
 
03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
fabulous to make it that simple um the
 
03:28:26.750 --> 03:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
goal is really about helping people
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
build their credit scores helping
 
03:28:29.830 --> 03:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
landlords collect rent on time so that
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
there are fewer cases of rent not being
 
03:28:34.710 --> 03:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
paid um I also wanted to share some
 
03:28:36.429 --> 03:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
information that I
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
received um from the credit Builders
 
03:28:41.790 --> 03:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
Alliance um so if you'll bear with me
 
03:28:43.790 --> 03:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
while I read their statement um they
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
said positive rent reporting is an
 
03:28:46.990 --> 03:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
accessible and safe way for renters to
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
build credit without taking on
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
additional debt reporting positive
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
rental history opens stores for
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who face barriers to credit
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
building or rebuilding for example
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
survivors of domestic violence veterans
 
03:28:59.710 --> 03:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
young people transitioning from foster
 
03:29:01.389 --> 03:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
care and homelessness and returning
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
citizens to name a few rent reporting
 
03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
also allows individuals renting
 
03:29:07.750 --> 03:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing units to build a
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
stronger credit history and places them
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
on a path toward its improved Financial
 
03:29:13.349 --> 03:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
stability and possibly even purchasing
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
their first home rent reporting when
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
offered as an opt-in program with
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
positive payment information is a
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
low-risk method for building credit
 
03:29:23.349 --> 03:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
strength negative information concerning
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
overdue rental payments is already
 
03:29:26.670 --> 03:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
incorporated into rental reports and
 
03:29:28.830 --> 03:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
scores through actions including account
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
sent to collections and evictions so
 
03:29:32.670 --> 03:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
positive only reporting allows renters
 
03:29:34.590 --> 03:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
to get credit for their record of timely
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
payments the credit Builders Alliance
 
03:29:38.950 --> 03:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
CBA has been actively involved in rent
 
03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
reporting as a credit building strategy
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
since 2012 during that time CBA has led
 
03:29:46.030 --> 03:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
over 80 affordable housing providers
 
03:29:47.229 --> 03:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
through the implementation of rent
 
03:29:49.269 --> 03:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
reporting programs at their respective
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
agencies research from these landlords
 
03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
the credit reporting agencies and the US
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
03:29:56.510 --> 03:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
Development have all shown that rent
 
03:29:57.870 --> 03:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
reporting to be an effective way to
 
03:30:00.670 --> 03:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
build CR credit and encourage ontime
 
03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
rental payments um and then there's more
 
03:30:06.030 --> 03:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
details about Colorado's program about a
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
program in Prince George County Maryland
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
Etc and I will um send this to you as an
 
03:30:12.150 --> 03:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
email afterwards because I know it's a
 
03:30:13.389 --> 03:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
lot of data and there's some links in
 
03:30:15.630 --> 03:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
here as well and I know I spoke really
 
03:30:17.229 --> 03:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
fast but I also know you've been here a
 
03:30:19.349 --> 03:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
long time and have many bills after me
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
so I'll be happy to take any questions
 
03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
oh I appreciate that represent C
 
03:30:25.710 --> 03:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
represent Miner thank you Mr chairman
 
03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony I had
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
just have a question about what about
 
03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
landlords that don't have the programs
 
03:30:36.750 --> 03:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
like that you spoke of like some like a
 
03:30:38.710 --> 03:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
1980s program that doesn't have that
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
option and some that don't use any
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
program just use like the data sheet
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
they create themselves what's the cost
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
going to be to them so uh for the most
 
03:30:49.349 --> 03:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
part my understanding from reaching out
 
03:30:51.550 --> 03:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
to I think it was ex
 
03:30:53.830 --> 03:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
experion I think that's how you say it
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
um there I reached out to several
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
different places they don't actually
 
03:30:59.189 --> 03:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
charge a fee to landlords to report the
 
03:31:02.429 --> 03:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
information so it's the time um but
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
again I'm looking not at the people who
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
have like you know Grandma living in the
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
backyard but looking at people who are
 
03:31:09.389 --> 03:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
managing who are doing this as their
 
03:31:11.229 --> 03:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
profession right and that's where
 
03:31:12.750 --> 03:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
identifying what that number is whether
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's 15 whether it's 20 properties is up
 
03:31:17.590 --> 03:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
to you um and I would specifically keep
 
03:31:20.710 --> 03:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
it to residential um property management
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
or landlords can I just follow up thank
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
you yes um I I personally am aware of a
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
few different landlords that own quite a
 
03:31:31.469 --> 03:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
few properties that have none of the
 
03:31:33.710 --> 03:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
those programs because of the I know
 
03:31:35.150 --> 03:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
that some of those programs cost money
 
03:31:38.670 --> 03:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
to even have per unit so they don't they
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
choose to just do it the oldfashioned
 
03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
way I just do you have an idea of what
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
the cost would be again it there's
 
03:31:48.870 --> 03:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's the credit bureaus don't charge
 
03:31:50.349 --> 03:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
a fee to have the information reported
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
to them so it's what their time spent
 
03:31:56.030 --> 03:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay would be submitting the information
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
rather than um you know having a simple
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
Software System that might save them
 
03:32:05.229 --> 03:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
there so I have yet to find a fee for
 
03:32:07.070 --> 03:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
providing the information thank you I I
 
03:32:08.830 --> 03:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
I have looked it's possible I have not
 
03:32:08.840 --> 03:32:09.710 align:start position:0%
I have looked it's possible I have not
checked

03:32:09.710 --> 03:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
checked
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere representative Aaron thank
 
03:32:15.309 --> 03:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
you very much uh Mr chair and uh thank
 
03:32:17.950 --> 03:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
you for coming in to testify and to
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill is my understanding
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
that tenants can ask for this reporting
 
03:32:28.150 --> 03:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
now is that correct and if so is this
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill going to compel landlords to do
 
03:32:34.429 --> 03:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
this so in the current housing
 
03:32:37.469 --> 03:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
environment um people have been afraid
 
03:32:39.550 --> 03:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
to ask tenant uh landlords for anything
 
03:32:41.349 --> 03:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
beyond what's offered in an initial
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
lease and if a landlord is not already
 
03:32:46.269 --> 03:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
offering this as a part of the program
 
03:32:49.030 --> 03:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I have found most tenants afraid to
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
ask for any supplemental anything for
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
fear of not being able to access an
 
03:32:55.070 --> 03:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
apartment however the landlords that
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to who have worked to make
 
03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
sure that they have tenants who have
 
03:33:01.189 --> 03:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
good you know reasonable credit scores
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
and are consistent in paying or who are
 
03:33:05.229 --> 03:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
encouraging their tenants to continue to
 
03:33:07.469 --> 03:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
build themselves have all welcomed using
 
03:33:09.269 --> 03:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
this program I spoke as I said I think
 
03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
to seven different property managers and
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh four of them were using this and
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
finding great success and one of them
 
03:33:17.349 --> 03:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
said she realized she needed to use it I
 
03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
also spoke to someone from the Housing
 
03:33:20.990 --> 03:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
Authority um the Portsmouth Housing
 
03:33:22.830 --> 03:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
Authority who said that this would be a
 
03:33:25.710 --> 03:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
useful tool for them thank you
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Paige and then
 
03:33:26.640 --> 03:33:27.630 align:start position:0%
representative Paige and then
representative

03:33:27.630 --> 03:33:27.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:30.189 --> 03:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
Gibbs okay representative
 
03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr shair and thank you
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
for coming in to
 
03:33:36.550 --> 03:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
testify um you mentioned that you
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
believe the bill should be amended do
 
03:33:40.910 --> 03:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
you plan to present an amendment to this
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee so I would be happy to present
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the committee I thought
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
that I should find out from the
 
03:33:50.030 --> 03:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee given how uh overburdened OS
 
03:33:52.670 --> 03:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
has uh been reportedly um that I should
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
find out from the committee what
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
language you would prefer to have in the
 
03:33:58.269 --> 03:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
amendment so that when I reach out to
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
them to simplify it especially in terms
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
of things like how many landlords or how
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
many prop units a landlord might manage
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we would have some consensus so
 
03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
that we could have them draft a single
 
03:34:10.349 --> 03:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment rather than going back and
 
03:34:12.990 --> 03:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
forth than having them have extra
 
03:34:17.070 --> 03:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
work go ahead thank you um how would you
 
03:34:19.349 --> 03:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
obtain that information I I don't know
 
03:34:21.389 --> 03:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
that the committee would necessarily be
 
03:34:24.030 --> 03:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
in agreement as to what we would
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
want um I I would hope that your
 
03:34:28.349 --> 03:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
committee would have some sort of
 
03:34:29.830 --> 03:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
conversation and that a member of your
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee would be willing to work with
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
me I more than happy to um to work with
 
03:34:36.910 --> 03:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
you in any way appropriate I will be
 
03:34:38.830 --> 03:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
here many many days as I've been
 
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
appointed to the education
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
administration and policy committee and
 
03:34:45.030 --> 03:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
so I will be here many more days than I
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
had intended
 
03:34:49.189 --> 03:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
well representative without having to
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
overburden this committee which I know
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
is very busy would you consider an
 
03:34:54.189 --> 03:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that would turn this into a
 
03:34:55.750 --> 03:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
study committee so the legislature could
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
study it this term um if if you wanted
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
to uh have it as a study to bring back
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
for next year we could do that or if you
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a short-term study
 
03:35:07.229 --> 03:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee you know I'm happy to do that
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to have a few study
 
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
meetings we I I would be open to that
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
again my goal is really trying to seek
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
that win-win to help landlords increase
 
03:35:17.189 --> 03:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
their on Time Rental payments and to
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
help tenants build their credit scores
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.550 --> 03:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
simultaneously all right thank you very
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
much thank you next up is um
 
03:35:31.950 --> 03:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
hi yes I've been hovering for quite some
 
03:35:37.870 --> 03:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
time welcome um I know that y'all have
 
03:35:39.070 --> 03:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
had a long day so I'm going to keep it
 
03:35:41.070 --> 03:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
short and sweet as I like to
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
do uh my name is Jody NL and I represent
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
chesa in Keen
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
um consumer credit reports are meant to
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
reflect an individual's likelihood of
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
repaying in debt in applying for my
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage 9 years ago it was made very
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
clear to me that my credit report and my
 
03:35:58.110 --> 03:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
credit score were the most important
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
factors up until that point I had been
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
renting for 17 years and I had never
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
once missed a payment in spite of the
 
03:36:05.830 --> 03:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
fact that I often didn't have enough to
 
03:36:07.870 --> 03:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
cover everything while I may not have
 
03:36:09.870 --> 03:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
had enough to pay my cell phone bill or
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
any other report worthy bills that month
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
I made sure that I did not jeopardize
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
the one thing that would ensure I had a
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
roof over my head and a warm place to
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
tuck my kids in at
 
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
night therefore if a mortgage company or
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
a landlord um wants accurate data and
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
indicating whether or not an individual
 
03:36:29.790 --> 03:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
is likely to pay their rent or mortgage
 
03:36:32.429 --> 03:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
which is what a credit report is for um
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
in this is in fact the best data point
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
have further if my mortgage payments are
 
03:36:40.990 --> 03:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
reported and they are and included in
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
calculating my credit score and they are
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
so should my rental payment hit
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh if I so choose and the last Point um
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of considering this um from a
 
03:36:54.590 --> 03:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
landlord's perspective um in a changing
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
landscape of property ownership often
 
03:36:58.349 --> 03:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
towards corporate ownership in
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
management it's cumbersome and frankly
 
03:37:02.349 --> 03:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
it strikes me as outdated to expect to
 
03:37:04.670 --> 03:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
be able to reach a previous landlord uh
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
to confirm good payment history so this
 
03:37:08.910 --> 03:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
makes it easier all around um the times
 
03:37:10.150 --> 03:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
have changed and I think we need to
 
03:37:13.349 --> 03:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
adapt the bill would not only allow for
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
a more accurate picture of an individual
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
likelihood to pay their housing expenses
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
it would ease the burden on previous and
 
03:37:21.710 --> 03:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
prospective landlords and mortgage
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
companies at the same time thank you for
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony happy to take
 
03:37:27.150 --> 03:37:27.160 align:start position:0%

03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
Freeman all right hello again um so uh
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the credit reporting um
 
03:37:46.229 --> 03:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
we're we're really big advocat for home
 
03:37:47.790 --> 03:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
ownership um part of the value
 
03:37:49.710 --> 03:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
proposition of our room by room model is
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
that compared to the cost of a
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom or Studio within one or two
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
years you could save up conceivably
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
enough money for a down payment on your
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
own home um after just a few short
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
leasing cycles and um uh we have a
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
provision in our lease uh that allows
 
03:38:07.950 --> 03:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
any tenant uh to terminate as if it were
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
a month-to-month tenancy if the reason
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they're doing that is to become a
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
homeowner um so pretty pretty committed
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
to this I also freely consult with my
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
tenants on matters of personal finance
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a finance professional and it's what
 
03:38:21.150 --> 03:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
I think is fun which is probably weird
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
but um uh credit's a huge component of
 
03:38:26.830 --> 03:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
that and uh we do advise our tenants on
 
03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
matters like building credit with things
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
like secured credit cards um with rent
 
03:38:33.510 --> 03:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
reporting options uh our software does
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do rent reporting uh
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
after very careful consideration I opted
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
not to enable it because I did not feel
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
that uh there was enough transparency in
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
how the software was functioning for me
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
able for me to be able to validate what
 
03:38:49.150 --> 03:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
was going out to the Credit Agencies
 
03:38:50.510 --> 03:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be accurate and the last thing I
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
wanted was to be part of a chain of
 
03:38:55.150 --> 03:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
events that resulted in a deterioration
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
of somebody's credit score um that could
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
be things like miscellaneous charges
 
03:39:01.229 --> 03:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
that were posted after the rent was paid
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
but before the grace period expiration
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
was calculated um reading through the
 
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
bill it is a very very honorous Bill and
 
03:39:10.590 --> 03:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
so while in general I'm in favor of the
 
03:39:13.070 --> 03:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
concept of um rent reporting for the
 
03:39:15.150 --> 03:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of building credit I think that
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
the specific way that it's implemented
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
is really important um even with
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
software that theoretically can report
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh payments uh our software still
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to comply with
 
03:39:28.229 --> 03:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
the technical requirements for example
 
03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
disambiguating uh rent payments that are
 
03:39:33.389 --> 03:39:33.399 align:start position:0%
done on time versus uh the participation
 
03:39:34.710 --> 03:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
fees that's just not something that we
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
can do so even though we have the
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
technical capability we'd still be
 
03:39:40.510 --> 03:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
looking for a third-party solution um
 
03:39:41.910 --> 03:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say is that some
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
of these Solutions already exist out
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
there and some of them exist on a free
 
03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
of basis uh for tenants to participate
 
03:39:50.550 --> 03:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
in if you do a quick Google search uh
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of platforms out there
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
where you can um I think you have to
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
upload a copy of your lease to prove you
 
03:39:57.550 --> 03:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
know which monthly payment is coming out
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
of your bank account corresponds to your
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
rent um there's some verification work
 
03:40:04.229 --> 03:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
that goes into that uh but then it's
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
connected they can see oh I paid you
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
know 850 bucks on the first for the past
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
12 months and it's done uh leveraging
 
03:40:13.630 --> 03:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
the technological capabilities of
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
companies that specialize in this versus
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
the ineptitude of um you know landlords
 
03:40:20.110 --> 03:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
under 15 who probably wouldn't be able
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
to navigate um navigate the technical
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
complexities or the fer compliance
 
03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
aspects of it um you know so I think if
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
you if you wanted to take another
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
approach uh when I think about what I
 
03:40:33.950 --> 03:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
would consider to be not not too
 
03:40:37.150 --> 03:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
burdensome um I would I'd be happy to
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
have a solution where if one of these
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
platforms reaches out to me looking for
 
03:40:43.389 --> 03:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
verification that the details provided
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
by a tenant are accurate I'd be happy to
 
03:40:48.269 --> 03:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
respond to a request like that um but as
 
03:40:49.870 --> 03:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
written we won't be able to comply with
 
03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
this without adding significant
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that um you know
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
frankly uh you know we just everyone's
 
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
just got their Spotify wrapped I got a
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
wrapped from my my uh business VoIP
 
03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
system telling me that in 2024 I sent
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
35,000 text messages and this is my my
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
side gig you know um people go Chris how
 
03:41:10.269 --> 03:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
how do you do it all and I say I don't
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
do everything we let stuff slip through
 
03:41:14.110 --> 03:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
the cracks and we just we can't take on
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
the administrative burden of the bill is
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
written thank you very much for your
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um questions for Mr
 
03:41:23.189 --> 03:41:23.199 align:start position:0%

builders doing a hatrick with the
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
housing committee
 
03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
today we like the idea of it study
 
03:41:44.229 --> 03:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
commital work but please
 
03:41:48.149 --> 03:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
don't there are 14 apps that I found in
 
03:41:50.469 --> 03:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
90 seconds that will help you
 
03:41:52.110 --> 03:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
self-report because some of the
 
03:41:54.510 --> 03:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of this are if
 
03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
you go from a large complex that does
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
report to a small complex that does
 
03:42:02.149 --> 03:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
not to a three years later you go to
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
another large complex then you go to buy
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
a house they can say what happened here
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
go find it there's a gap in your credit
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
report what happened there's an app out
 
03:42:15.389 --> 03:42:15.399 align:start position:0%
there right now that will work with with
 
03:42:18.830 --> 03:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
you they will pay your housing provider
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
they take it automatically out of your
 
03:42:23.830 --> 03:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
checking account for a small fee they
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
pay the housing provider and then they
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
report the ontime
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
payments the corporate world does this
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
now one of our members is a large
 
03:42:36.429 --> 03:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
company that's the second largest
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
provider of housing in New Hampshire
 
03:42:40.349 --> 03:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
they're bringing this on as a value
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
added for their
 
03:42:45.510 --> 03:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
tenants please don't regulate things are
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
fixing themselves and there are options
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
out there if you wish to do that I'm
 
03:42:53.950 --> 03:42:53.960 align:start position:0%

question yes sir did you consider this a
 
03:42:59.760 --> 03:43:01.910 align:start position:0%
question yes sir did you consider this a
mandate

03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you um representative
 
03:43:07.590 --> 03:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
kwin I'll say okay thank you very much
 
03:43:09.389 --> 03:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
Mr M thank
 
03:43:15.389 --> 03:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much once again for the
 
03:43:18.510 --> 03:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
03:43:20.910 --> 03:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
speak unfortunately there's actually a
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
lot of things to say here and this time
 
03:43:25.469 --> 03:43:25.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going to remember to pass out my
 
03:43:27.550 --> 03:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
testimony because there's a lot in here
 
03:43:27.560 --> 03:43:39.429 align:start position:0%
testimony because there's a lot in here
to

03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:39.439 --> 03:43:41.149 align:start position:0%
 
read

03:43:41.149 --> 03:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
so we have not done rent reporting
 
03:43:48.590 --> 03:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
because we have at times been members of
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
credit bureaus for the purposes of
 
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
getting credit reports and screening
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
tenants as they apply for apartments and
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
what we've experienced over the years
 
03:44:01.550 --> 03:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
has always been very difficult to be
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
able to report uh payments to the credit
 
03:44:09.630 --> 03:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
bureaus one of our members owns perhaps
 
03:44:12.550 --> 03:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
in the range of 2,000 units so they're
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
what you might consider a big property
 
03:44:14.720 --> 03:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
what you might consider a big property
owner

03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
owner
 
03:44:19.990 --> 03:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
and what they said was it was very cost
 
03:44:24.429 --> 03:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to um use that software very
 
03:44:27.189 --> 03:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
use different software platforms to do
 
03:44:27.199 --> 03:44:30.229 align:start position:0%
use different software platforms to do
this

03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.309 --> 03:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
um and so they they're looking into it
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
but the cost and administration of doing
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
it in compliance and setting up the
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
different systems is is U quite
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
large there is a credit
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
reporting service I looked up one Matt
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
Maybury mentioned within a few seconds
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
he had found a Bunches of them there's
 
03:44:55.750 --> 03:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
one called self.inc which is free for
 
03:44:58.389 --> 03:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
tenants to use to report their rent
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
their website says get credit for paying
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
rent plus your cell phone in utilities
 
03:45:05.710 --> 03:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
they apparently lots of bills they can
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
report this way 100% free no credit card
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
or credit check
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
required so there's many services that
 
03:45:16.750 --> 03:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
can already do this to mandate it onto
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
Property Owners at a large cost um you
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
know just doesn't make sense anyone can
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
build good
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
credit you just have to be
 
03:45:31.710 --> 03:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
disciplined every tenant that gets into
 
03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
one of our Apartments if they're having
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
trouble with tenant uh credit we we talk
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
to them and tell them here's a strategy
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's simple doesn't cost you a dime
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
and will build you credit you just have
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
to be dissing with your
 
03:45:46.750 --> 03:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
discipline with your payments if you
 
03:45:48.269 --> 03:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
want I'll tell you how that
 
03:45:48.279 --> 03:45:49.870 align:start position:0%
want I'll tell you how that
works

03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
um how would a housing provider actually
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
calculate the cost of administrating
 
03:45:58.349 --> 03:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
this there's no guidance in the bill do
 
03:46:00.389 --> 03:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
do you track how much time that you
 
03:46:01.870 --> 03:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
spent doing this what about you're
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
paying employees what about their cost
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
and their time what about the benefits
 
03:46:09.309 --> 03:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
and social the Social
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
Security employer portions of that what
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
are the costs that you would calculate
 
03:46:17.070 --> 03:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
to figure out the cost that you would
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
charge them most M most landlords
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as you've heard
 
03:46:25.149 --> 03:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
over and over and we certainly in our
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
awareness think it's true our mom and
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
pop landlords they don't have the means
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
of doing this um it is is quite a a
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
burden to be reporting all of it Mr
 
03:46:38.070 --> 03:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
Norman I as you wrap up if you could
 
03:46:40.389 --> 03:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
please uh there's there's so much more
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
there's so many problems the way it's
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
written so we don't have
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
an objection to the idea of reporting
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
rent in fact that could be good on both
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
sides but to burden Property Owners is
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
they have to do that and increase their
 
03:46:58.229 --> 03:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
cost Administration when there's free
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
options already available it doesn't
 
03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
make any sense there there's so much
 
03:47:05.469 --> 03:47:05.479 align:start position:0%
more and I would take questions thank
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony questions for Mr
 
03:47:10.030 --> 03:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
Norman seeing none thank
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
thank you to the for hearing me to the
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
chairman and the committee um the
 
03:47:26.910 --> 03:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
overall concept of per of reporting
 
03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
rents I understand why the sponsor is
 
03:47:32.070 --> 03:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
pushing it and I think for me the
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill of the mechanics
 
03:47:36.030 --> 03:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill and just as a very brief one
 
03:47:38.710 --> 03:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
it says we can get $10 per month or
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
actual cost which is whichever is lower
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to calculate actual
 
03:47:45.070 --> 03:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
costs and if the tenant challenges it
 
03:47:46.590 --> 03:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
how am I going to prove that my actual
 
03:47:50.349 --> 03:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
costs are lower uh for instance I was
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
using and use QuickBooks QuickBooks does
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
not communicate that type of rent
 
03:47:58.590 --> 03:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
payments and I'm a small landlord and
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
what am I going to have to do go through
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
every single tenant file on QuickBooks
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
to and report it monthly that they paid
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's a lot of time and that's
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
not fair I think at this point I would
 
03:48:13.229 --> 03:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
like to pick up on something that the
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
chairman said that this bill should go
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
to study committee let's find mechanics
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
that work well for both landlords
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
tenants and the credit reporting
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
agencies the bill that's written the
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor said was modeled after
 
03:48:27.309 --> 03:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
California we know California does
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
things a little differently than we do
 
03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I think we really
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
should do it the New Hampshire way let's
 
03:48:34.429 --> 03:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
study it let's think about it let's get
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
input from everybody and I would suggest
 
03:48:38.189 --> 03:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
to the committee please send this to
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
study committee and take it and let us
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
work it through in a manner that can
 
03:48:44.189 --> 03:48:44.199 align:start position:0%
find a solution that everybody would can
 
03:48:47.189 --> 03:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
live with thank you questions for Mr
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%

03:53:21.910 --> 03:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much chairman and
 
03:53:23.630 --> 03:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee for indulging
 
03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
me for a couple minutes um I appreciate
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
your time I am a co-sponsor on this bill
 
03:53:32.590 --> 03:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
and I am in support of passing the bill
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
um this has something that has actually
 
03:53:36.429 --> 03:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
affected me personally when I was
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
younger and first moving out of my
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
parents house I couldn't find um someone
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
willing to rent to me without a credit
 
03:53:45.630 --> 03:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
history and the only way I was able to
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
get an apartment was basically sneaking
 
03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
onto a friend's lease getting a credit
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
card and then uh starting to build up
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
credit that way and as we know housing
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
is scarce right now a lot of landlords
 
03:53:59.469 --> 03:53:59.479 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have really high
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
standards for you know potential tenants
 
03:54:03.189 --> 03:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
availability and I think it's important
 
03:54:07.950 --> 03:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
we provide every tool possible to help
 
03:54:10.469 --> 03:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
um people be able to build up their
 
03:54:12.670 --> 03:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
credit have a more established and
 
03:54:15.070 --> 03:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
secure place in society
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
and I think it I've heard some of the
 
03:54:19.710 --> 03:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
concerns I was watching the testimony
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
remotely from um landlords and housting
 
03:54:24.670 --> 03:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
providers regarding the implementation
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
of this and I do understand that there
 
03:54:29.389 --> 03:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
could be some concerns and that there
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
are ways already for tenants to self
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
report on those payments but I think it
 
03:54:38.189 --> 03:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the burden to be on the
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
person who's receiving the money to
 
03:54:41.110 --> 03:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
report that they receed the money just
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
like it would be for an employer for
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
someone who's um you know giving a loan
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
out it's on them to facilitate that
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
transaction um and I think
 
03:54:54.429 --> 03:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
objectively the housing providers have
 
03:54:56.830 --> 03:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
more time money resources than the
 
03:54:59.550 --> 03:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
renters do and so the most effective way
 
03:55:01.950 --> 03:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that renters can um you know
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
take use of such legislation would be to
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that the landlords are carrying
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
that burden so I just wanted to share my
 
03:55:11.469 --> 03:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
personal thoughts on it thank you so
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
much well representative thank you for
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%

electronic payments optional I've
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%

you and one for the
 
03:56:15.790 --> 03:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
clerk House Bill 309 prohibits landlords
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
from taking payments only key word here
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
only by electronic means this bill would
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
then require landlords to take payments
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
in various forms not just limited to
 
03:56:30.880 --> 03:56:32.469 align:start position:0%
in various forms not just limited to
electronic

03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
means now this bill idea came to me at
 
03:56:37.630 --> 03:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
the request of a constituent who is here
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
today who will testify after
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
me I would say this uh to the housing
 
03:56:43.800 --> 03:56:45.189 align:start position:0%
me I would say this uh to the housing
committee

03:56:45.189 --> 03:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
our legislature should be mindful not to
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
strain or further complicate any
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
relationship between landlord and tenant
 
03:56:59.189 --> 03:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
especially during a housing crisis House
 
03:57:02.110 --> 03:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 309 will open the options of
 
03:57:05.910 --> 03:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
payment from tenants to landlords so as
 
03:57:10.349 --> 03:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
to not limit or rule out renters based
 
03:57:14.469 --> 03:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
on method of payment
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill 309 supports accessibility
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
and flexibility which are two Essentials
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
toward rental agreements so I'd ask that
 
03:57:25.389 --> 03:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
you keep that in mind as you deliberate
 
03:57:26.750 --> 03:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
309 thank you I also oh go ahead ask
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%

03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
for her rent payments she has never been
 
03:58:50.429 --> 03:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
late on her rent payments and has never
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
bounced a check under federal law 12 CFR
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
1051b regarding electronic funds
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
transfers it requires that authorization
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
must be in writing in order to take
 
03:59:05.550 --> 03:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
authorized funds out of somebody's
 
03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
account by forcing consumers to make
 
03:59:09.429 --> 03:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
rent payments electronically by
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
automatic draft takes away their freedom
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
to consent to such transactions and
 
03:59:16.110 --> 03:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
shoot can be considered an abuse of an
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
unequal bargaining power between the
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
landlord and the tenants recurring
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
electronic funds transfers are not
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
limited to any dollar amount but allow
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
businesses to raid consumers accounts
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
for what they believe they are owed not
 
03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
limited to the amount stipulated in the
 
03:59:32.670 --> 03:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
lease agreement consumers would have to
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
issue a stop payment if the businesses
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
took money from their accounts if the
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
consumer believed the amount was
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
transferred in error incurring a costly
 
03:59:42.510 --> 03:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
stop payment fee this also affects
 
03:59:44.070 --> 03:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners when mortgage service
 
03:59:45.870 --> 03:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
businesses utilize something called a
 
03:59:49.389 --> 03:59:49.399 align:start position:0%
pre-authorized draft or a pad to deduct
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
mortgage payments based on the
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
information on the face of your
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
homeowner's check without receiving
 
03:59:56.990 --> 03:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
authorization from the homeowner another
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
critical point uh about recurring
 
04:00:00.870 --> 04:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
electronic funds drafts in the pads are
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
that there aren't no papers created in
 
04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
the transacts with a check the consumer
 
04:00:06.510 --> 04:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
has an auditable proof that they made
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
their rent or mortgage payment on time
 
04:00:10.349 --> 04:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
and the landlord or mortgage company
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
cash it on a particular date with efts
 
04:00:15.030 --> 04:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's only a line entry in a bank
 
04:00:17.510 --> 04:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
statement for a tenant or homeowner to
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
prove that they have made payments
 
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
regularly and on time they would have to
 
04:00:22.990 --> 04:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
produce a stack of bank statements
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
rather than cancel checks and they would
 
04:00:26.910 --> 04:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
have to argue about what transactions
 
04:00:29.670 --> 04:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
were based on in our rush to do away
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
with hard currency using checks
 
04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining audible transactions between
 
04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
consumers and businesses forcing EFT
 
04:00:38.110 --> 04:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
rent payments on renters is an
 
04:00:40.510 --> 04:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
uncontable act of Oppression against
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
people already with limited means all
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
for the sake of saving a few steps in
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
processing payments for the landlord's
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
business Enders please pass this
 
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
legislation I'd like to refer to uh it's
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
a little more Draconian in some states
 
04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut Illinois New York and New
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
Jersey landlords cannot require
 
04:01:01.710 --> 04:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
electronic payments however we're asking
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
for the middle ground which is similar
 
04:01:06.309 --> 04:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
to California and Texas and Washington
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
that the landlord must accept at least
 
04:01:11.469 --> 04:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
one other form of payment besides EFT
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
04:01:14.670 --> 04:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for your
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for Mr
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
bevel seeing none thank you thank you
 
04:01:20.600 --> 04:01:27.750 align:start position:0%
bevel seeing none thank you thank you
Nick

04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
Norman thank you once again for the
 
04:01:31.790 --> 04:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I have written
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
so while housing providers don't really
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
have much of an objection to the concept
 
04:01:51.239 --> 04:01:52.670 align:start position:0%
have much of an objection to the concept
that's

04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
here um there's an extreme objection to
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
where it's placed in the
 
04:01:59.040 --> 04:02:03.070 align:start position:0%
where it's placed in the
law

04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:03.080 --> 04:02:06.269 align:start position:0%
 
540

04:02:06.269 --> 04:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:10.110 --> 04:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
um- a colon three is the section of the
 
04:02:12.349 --> 04:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
law that's called prohibited
 
04:02:15.790 --> 04:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
practices that car cares with it
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
automatically fees and penalties of
 
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per day plus court costs in
 
04:02:23.000 --> 04:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per day plus court costs in
attorney's

04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
attorney's
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
fees which is just AB absolutely
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
absurd to be charged for someone that
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
requires rental payment
 
04:02:38.349 --> 04:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
by uh electronic means and doesn't know
 
04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
that that's not allowed we can just if
 
04:02:43.870 --> 04:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
they are told sorry you can't do that
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
the not change it you have to accept
 
04:02:48.510 --> 04:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
payments as people would normally do it
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be $1,000 a day court costs
 
04:02:55.950 --> 04:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
and legal fees and when does that ,000
 
04:02:58.030 --> 04:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
per day
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
stop there's no way to to regulate or
 
04:03:04.030 --> 04:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
Define when that ,000 per day would stop
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
suppose that particular tenant doesn't
 
04:03:07.870 --> 04:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
have email
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
phone doesn't speak English how do they
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
get noticed that the the housing
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
provider is uh turned um reversed their
 
04:03:20.110 --> 04:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
policy and that they can pay now and
 
04:03:20.120 --> 04:03:20.910 align:start position:0%
policy and that they can pay now and
other

04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
means so uh if if it was carved out that
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
that fines and fees don't apply which
 
04:03:33.910 --> 04:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
has been done in many other categories
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
if you'd like we could prepare an
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
amendment which might be like five or 10
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
characters long to say add this car out
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
to those fees uh we could do that for
 
04:03:49.469 --> 04:03:49.479 align:start position:0%
you we've been there many times um so
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'd be very happy to take
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr chair
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Norman for your testimony I
 
04:04:01.550 --> 04:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
regret to inform you that you have
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
incorrectly cited the penalty in 540 um
 
04:04:06.910 --> 04:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
the penalty cites the consumer
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
protection act and in the consumer
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
protection act the penalty that I think
 
04:04:14.550 --> 04:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you're getting representative I it
 
04:04:16.870 --> 04:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
will be a question Mr Norman is
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
providing public testimony sure you can
 
04:04:20.950 --> 04:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
state that that was incorrectly stated
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
during an executive session but if you
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
have a I have a question you can ask the
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
question that's right keep going to the
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
question please were you actually
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
referencing though maybe inelegantly put
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that the penalty cited in 540
 
04:04:38.349 --> 04:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
is the consumer protection act and in
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act there's a
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
penalty and the only time $1,000 a day
 
04:04:45.149 --> 04:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
comes up is when the person in this case
 
04:04:47.990 --> 04:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
the landlord is in direct violation of a
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
court order and it ends when a landlord
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
complies with the court order is that
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
what you were actually referencing there
 
04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
is a reference that says there is $1,000
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
per day it
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
continues well it says the fine is
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per day it continues every day
 
04:05:07.159 --> 04:05:08.309 align:start position:0%
$1,000 per day it continues every day
that

04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
the violation is still in place so if
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of when that ends
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
it would continue at $1,000 per day
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
all set thank you Mr
 
04:05:33.149 --> 04:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:36.030 --> 04:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
Freeman all right so I was playing with
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
my GameCube when this one came through
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
my fax machine um I don't really
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
understand why we're going to compel
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
landlords to take such a big step
 
04:05:43.159 --> 04:05:44.149 align:start position:0%
landlords to take such a big step
backwards

04:05:44.149 --> 04:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
um listening to some of the other
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I just want to make a few
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
quick Corrections one uh individual said
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
that um there's no paper trail when you
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
have an a uh transaction and I think you
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually have a tighter paper trail with
 
04:05:58.510 --> 04:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
an a transaction than you do with a
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
papercheck uh merchant services accounts
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
track everything from the date and time
 
04:06:04.349 --> 04:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
of the origination the amount the
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
institutions that are coming through uh
 
04:06:08.349 --> 04:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
if there are any rejected payments it
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
keeps track of what the reason for the
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
rejection was uh so it's pretty good
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
paper trail if you ever do have a
 
04:06:16.710 --> 04:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
dispute over the payment um in terms of
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
the accessibility of the payment means I
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
can think of a few areas where you could
 
04:06:23.149 --> 04:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
make a case that uh alternate means of
 
04:06:24.910 --> 04:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
payments are are beneficial to the
 
04:06:27.149 --> 04:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
individual renter um some of those would
 
04:06:29.469 --> 04:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
be if that person belongs to certain
 
04:06:31.750 --> 04:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
protected classes uh like if they have a
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
disability or if they are of an age
 
04:06:36.189 --> 04:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
where the the technological aspects of
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
sending in online rent payments uh is a
 
04:06:40.349 --> 04:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
barrier for them and I would just point
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
out those individuals already have
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
protections under the federal fairhouse
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
act to submit a reasonable accommodation
 
04:06:47.309 --> 04:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
request and the landlord would be
 
04:06:50.189 --> 04:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
obligated to comply with that um we have
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
we I personally require online payments
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
um it eliminates first of all it
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
automates the accounting we have another
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
proposal today to uh mandate that
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
landlords report uh rent payments to the
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
credit bureaus and there's a a
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping aspect that comes in with
 
04:07:06.149 --> 04:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
that which is what happens if that
 
04:07:07.950 --> 04:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
payment uh gets delayed in the mail or
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't get processed in a timely manner
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
with electronic payments that can happen
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
automatically and there's no concerns
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah I guess that's all I have well
 
04:07:25.070 --> 04:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Freeman for your testimony
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr
 
04:07:30.429 --> 04:07:30.439 align:start position:0%
Freeman yep seeing none go
 
04:07:33.149 --> 04:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Paige that's just a
 
04:07:35.189 --> 04:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
a question for the chair I don't know if
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
um representative Mooney would like to
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
speak to the question of the um the the
 
04:07:43.149 --> 04:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
fee here or the fine here but I would
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
certain love her input if she has any to
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
share on that question yeah
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney yeah can you
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.790 --> 04:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
available thank you I appreciate that
 
04:07:59.710 --> 04:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity I haven't given it a
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of thought having
 
04:08:02.590 --> 04:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
heard it for the first time like
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
yourself by the witness that spoke I
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
guess the important thing is that it
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
appears in the law at some point uh and
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
this where where it goes you know that's
 
04:08:13.510 --> 04:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
one thing I mean if it were to be with a
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
fine or without I think that's that's
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
fine as well I have no preference off
 
04:08:20.429 --> 04:08:20.439 align:start position:0%
hearing it for the first time the
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
important thing is that we not again in
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony I revert back to it that we
 
04:08:29.469 --> 04:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
not strain unnecessarily relationships
 
04:08:32.070 --> 04:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
between tenants and landlords
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
particularly on things like method of
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
payment and preference of payment so
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's my bottom line thank you okay
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
well it's in the committee's hands but
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
um I've heard the input from various
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
people so thank you very
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
good okay is there anyone left to
 
04:08:51.870 --> 04:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
testify on HB
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
309 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:08:55.950 --> 04:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing at
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
207 open up the public hearing on HB 296
 
04:09:03.389 --> 04:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize the prime
 
04:09:06.189 --> 04:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative lad is not here
 
04:09:06.199 --> 04:09:12.149 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative lad is not here
so

04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um yep I'm going to recess that public
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
hearing until representative lad comes
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
back and it is 2:00 so I'm going to
 
04:09:23.189 --> 04:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
um open the public hearing on HB 342 and
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor
 
04:09:24.439 --> 04:09:33.469 align:start position:0%
recognize the prime sponsor
representative

04:09:33.469 --> 04:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
you good after Mr chairman members of
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
the committee uh so this bill is a
 
04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
alteration just introduce yourself for
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
us that' be great uh I'm Patrick long
 
04:09:55.510 --> 04:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro 26 uh which for
 
04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
anyone who doesn't know it's Manchester
 
04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
w 7 uh and I'm the prime sponsor of the
 
04:10:05.070 --> 04:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill and so this is an alteration of an
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
idea that was in the homeus bill last
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
session and was rejected at that point
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I think it addresses some of the
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
concerns that some people had about that
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
proposal uh and also actually does a
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
better job than that bill would have of
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
addressing a specific problem that I've
 
04:10:24.429 --> 04:10:24.439 align:start position:0%
heard from several of my constituents in
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh so the previous proposal
 
04:10:27.720 --> 04:10:29.149 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh so the previous proposal
was

04:10:29.149 --> 04:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
to uh set a maximum of 10,000 square
 
04:10:35.950 --> 04:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
feet for the minimum lot sizes that
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities could uh require uh and
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
this instead of setting a uniform
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
maximum uh
 
04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
would uh set the maximum such that they
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't require minimums that are
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
significantly less dense than existing
 
04:10:55.950 --> 04:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
construction uh in the neighborhood uh
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
so municipalities that have a a an
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
interest in preserving existing local
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
character or that have you know issues
 
04:11:07.109 --> 04:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
like not being uh connected to Municipal
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
sewer could address those concerns uh
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
and could require people to build
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
consistent with what's already there but
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do what has been done in
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester over the last several decades
 
04:11:20.189 --> 04:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
that I've heard a bunch of complaints
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
about which is that uh a lot of the
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
housing in my ward is built on 5,000
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
foot Lots which was perfectly legal at
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
the time it was built uh but the city
 
04:11:34.229 --> 04:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
has ratcheted up the requirements over
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
time uh and is no longer legal to build
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
on a lot of that size even in
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where all the surrounding
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
construction uh is on that size size and
 
04:11:47.229 --> 04:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
several people have actually bought
 
04:11:49.469 --> 04:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
neighboring lots that were 5,000 sare ft
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
thinking they could build on it uh build
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
something for their in-laws or you an
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
extra rental property whatever uh it
 
04:11:58.670 --> 04:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
turns out they can't build a house on
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
that lot because the minimum is now
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
6,500 or 7500 Square ft or whatever it
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
may be where they're zoned
 
04:12:09.630 --> 04:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
so uh this would help address our
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
housing crisis it would address the
 
04:12:18.149 --> 04:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
actual expectations of property owners
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
when they buy a property that they could
 
04:12:22.349 --> 04:12:22.359 align:start position:0%
build something that's consistent with
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
what already exists in their area uh and
 
04:12:27.149 --> 04:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
it would still give municipalities
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility to prevent people from
 
04:12:32.189 --> 04:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
building something that's not consistent
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
with the existing neighborhood
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
character okay and I'm available to
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that any of you
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative for your
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
testimonial questions representative
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
Holland uh I have a question for you
 
04:12:47.950 --> 04:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
actually and thank you for taking my
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
question so so in this case you're
 
04:12:53.109 --> 04:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
saying that as long as I've met this
 
04:12:55.830 --> 04:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
density Conformity I I put my thousand
 
04:12:58.429 --> 04:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
foot tape ruler out I go out there and I
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
look and I I'm in essence you're
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
allowing me to bypass the variance rule
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
so I guess my first question would be uh
 
04:13:08.590 --> 04:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the that the planning
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
board then is going to look at your
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
density Conformity study and then from
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
that they'll approve your project why
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
would you not have the the
 
04:13:22.349 --> 04:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
zba since since in essence what you've
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
done is you've cut down from the five
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for a variance to One
 
04:13:28.830 --> 04:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
requirement the One requirement being
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
that you have your density study why
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
would you not have the zba judge if
 
04:13:37.990 --> 04:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
you've met what's required to get the
 
04:13:41.469 --> 04:13:41.479 align:start position:0%
variants um that was the way that OS
 
04:13:44.269 --> 04:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
wrote it I guess if if the committee
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
feels that the zba is the more
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate body to make that judgment I
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any objection to amending
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
it uh and I guess you know potentially
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
different municipalities might have
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
different processes set up where they do
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
this so if you are going to amend it it
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
might make sense to have something that
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
accounts for see whatever the planning
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
body with u that discretion is in that
 
04:14:12.710 --> 04:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
municipality can just a quick followup
 
04:14:12.720 --> 04:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
municipality can just a quick followup
so

04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
um you know ask somebody I just forgot
 
04:14:19.349 --> 04:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
my followup go ahead okay all right
 
04:14:19.359 --> 04:14:20.550 align:start position:0%
my followup go ahead okay all right
representative

04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:24.109 --> 04:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um and thank you for
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
coming in to testify um but isn't the
 
04:14:29.710 --> 04:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
point of the bill
 
04:14:32.630 --> 04:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
that if the proposed
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
building uh meets the neighborhood
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
character as specified in the bill you
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't need a variance so it's not a
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for a variance isn't it just
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
a situation where you don't have to ask
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
for a
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
variance yes that's correct as far as
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
the intent but I think you would still
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
have to prove somehow that you have met
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood density
 
04:14:59.469 --> 04:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
requirements represent how I'm sorry I
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
remembered it finally so um the the
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
second question is is like you put your
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
thousand foot radius out there and
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
you've already mentioned it that you
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
said that there's several because a
 
04:15:12.510 --> 04:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
variance is actually meant for a an
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
unusual ual circumstance it's kind of a
 
04:15:16.309 --> 04:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
one-off you just have this weird
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
property the variance isn't meant to
 
04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
override the actual Town ordinance per
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
se the spirit of the ordinance but what
 
04:15:26.429 --> 04:15:26.439 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that you think that
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
when I throw that that that thousand
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
foot radius out there I'm not going to
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
catch one property I may catch multiple
 
04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
properties and that the actual zoning
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
ordinance doesn't work and that you
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
think the zoning ordinance should change
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
so rather than give a variant shouldn't
 
04:15:42.030 --> 04:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
it be the planning board that's
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing your Z loing ordinance and
 
04:15:43.760 --> 04:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
reviewing your Z loing ordinance and
changing

04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
changing
 
04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
it ideally uh municipalities would
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
review it and make those changes but I
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
think we're running into a situation
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
where a lot of
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities have not done that
 
04:16:01.309 --> 04:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
um and the local governments are
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
preventing people from you using their
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
property as they see fit and using it in
 
04:16:07.710 --> 04:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
a way that's consistent with what's
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
already there uh because in a lot of
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
cases they have uh tightened the rules
 
04:16:14.750 --> 04:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
significantly since existing
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods were built and I know
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's what's going on in Manchester and
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's that process is starting to reverse
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh the city is in the process of a
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance overhaul right now but
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
over the last several decades uh they
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
have tightened the zoning ordinance in
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
ways that are not consistent with the
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
expectations of property owners
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
there represent baxton then represent
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
Aon so if I understand the point of this
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
bill correctly and please clarify in a
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
town like mine where we have a village
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
District of 200y old houses that have
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
sidey yards that are from zero to two
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
feet under our current
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
zoning you can't rebuild any of those
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
houses because they we require a 15ot
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
sidey yard in the village district and
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is a conversation that we our
 
04:17:11.309 --> 04:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
planning board has had and the selectman
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
have had so if we pass this bill I could
 
04:17:18.670 --> 04:17:18.680 align:start position:0%
go and say I have an existing lot of
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
record and every other house on this
 
04:17:23.550 --> 04:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
street has a two- foot sidey yard so
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
therefore a two- foot sidey yard is
 
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable is that the intent of the
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill uh yes I think that would be
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
allowed under this Bill thank you
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
represent Aon in your bill you state the
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
th000 foot radius is that th000 foot
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
radius from the property lines or from
 
04:17:45.630 --> 04:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
the building on the property that could
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
make a huge difference in a rural
 
04:17:50.710 --> 04:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
District uh the intent was it it be from
 
04:17:52.910 --> 04:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
the property lines I think there are
 
04:17:56.670 --> 04:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
some places where 1,000 ft from the
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
house or the whatever the central
 
04:18:00.269 --> 04:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
building is in the property wouldn't
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
property um so representative I'm hoping
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
you can speak to um a density conforming
 
04:18:13.149 --> 04:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
Conformity assessment and talk to me
 
04:18:15.710 --> 04:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
about the requirements involved in that
 
04:18:17.149 --> 04:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
and maybe if there's an additional cost
 
04:18:19.309 --> 04:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
on a land owner if you know the details
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
if not if there's somebody else that can
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
speak to that uh I don't know the
 
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
details um that was 's proposal for how
 
04:18:30.030 --> 04:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
to go about actually proving this so I
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
would be comfortable with any
 
04:18:35.189 --> 04:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
clarification or amendment of that to uh
 
04:18:38.109 --> 04:18:38.119 align:start position:0%
prevent or reduce costs on a land owner
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh I would just note that there are a
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
lot of existing costs on land owners who
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
wish to seek a variance um to build
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
right now uh and I I would not like to
 
04:18:51.149 --> 04:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
see those costs increased in a situation
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
where they would already be able to
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
build as of right um but my hope is that
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
in a situation where they would now be
 
04:19:01.149 --> 04:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
required to get a variance uh and spend
 
04:19:02.349 --> 04:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of money on attorneys and
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
Architects to do that uh that this would
 
04:19:07.950 --> 04:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
provide a streamlined process for uh
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
building what they want to build okay
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else thank you for your
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.149 --> 04:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
Burns good afternoon Margaret Burns
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:19:30.550 --> 04:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
Association I did Mark a pose on the
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
pink card that I handed in but mostly I
 
04:19:34.830 --> 04:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
would like to provide some comments to
 
04:19:37.630 --> 04:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for your consideration we
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
understand the concept behind the bill
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
which I would describe sort of as an
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
exped Ed variance procedure and I
 
04:19:47.070 --> 04:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
understand the goal and the purpose of
 
04:19:49.630 --> 04:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
the piece of legislation my suggestion
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
for your consideration is to make it
 
04:19:54.590 --> 04:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps a local option the reason that I
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
suggest that is because what is
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
happening with this bill is that
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
Authority that is traditionally reserved
 
04:20:03.109 --> 04:20:03.119 align:start position:0%
for the Zoning Board of adjustment which
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
would be the variance granting Authority
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
is really being delegated via this bill
 
04:20:09.870 --> 04:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
over to a different body which would be
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
the planning board so one suggestion to
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
make this workable would be to make it a
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
local option where the legislative body
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
would vote to approve this delegation of
 
04:20:21.550 --> 04:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
authority from one body to the to the
 
04:20:23.309 --> 04:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
other and then the planning board would
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
have this authority to Grant these types
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
of um special relief without the need to
 
04:20:30.429 --> 04:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
go through the zba another solution
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
could be to keep this Authority with the
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
zba but to make it sort of an additional
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
Authority additional to the regular
 
04:20:40.750 --> 04:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
granting of variances which does require
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
going through those five criteria which
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
is has been mentioned here already in
 
04:20:46.109 --> 04:20:46.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing so those would be my
 
04:20:47.950 --> 04:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions for your consideration and I
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate your time thank you
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um representative
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hicks thank you Mr chairman so as I'm
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
envisioning this I'm thinking about a
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
maybe a Granda non-conforming
 
04:21:03.870 --> 04:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um that then someone that
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe is more densely built as was
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
described earlier that somebody then
 
04:21:10.990 --> 04:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
extends and then somebody then extends
 
04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
and then somebody then extends um so at
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
some point it basically makes zoning
 
04:21:21.870 --> 04:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
moot is that could that be even though
 
04:21:23.229 --> 04:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
it may be theoretical could that be
 
04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
possibility it thank you for the
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
question it is a possibility and that
 
04:21:29.189 --> 04:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
sort of scenario that you described
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
would be sort of the basis of why I
 
04:21:34.269 --> 04:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
signed in opposition to the bill um
 
04:21:36.149 --> 04:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
despite the additional comments that I
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
provided you might we've heard this
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
described a little bit um with relation
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
to to Downtown City Zone in where it was
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
much denser before zoning went into
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
place but I don't think that's the only
 
04:21:49.710 --> 04:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
place that we might be concerned about
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
this there is a lot of very dense
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
building around lakes that um predated
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
zoning zoning by quite a bit and I think
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
we would all be concerned especially for
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of health and septic and the
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
other things that go into building
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
around Lakes I think we would all be
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about um that potentially be
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
expanded and made even more denser in
 
04:22:18.030 --> 04:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
those scenarios so that that is a
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
concern that I think is a potential
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
consequence of the
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
legislation represent
 
04:22:29.550 --> 04:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
Faxton well I'm going to skip past the
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
lake part because I'm not sure I agree
 
04:22:34.269 --> 04:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
with you on that but
 
04:22:37.109 --> 04:22:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh if we leave it the bill the way it's
 
04:22:40.109 --> 04:22:40.119 align:start position:0%
written and it goes to planning and
 
04:22:43.950 --> 04:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
planning turns it down for whatever good
 
04:22:46.109 --> 04:22:46.119 align:start position:0%
or bad reason I would still have the
 
04:22:47.790 --> 04:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to the
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
zba I can appeal any decision to the
 
04:22:52.830 --> 04:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
planning board to the zba so leave
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
sending it to planning actually gives a
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
potential applicant Two
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
Shots um thank you for that question I
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
think typically when you appeal to the
 
04:23:06.510 --> 04:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
zba from the planning board you're
 
04:23:08.309 --> 04:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
appealing and interpretation of the
 
04:23:11.469 --> 04:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance and so perhaps another
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
piece of this that might be important to
 
04:23:16.830 --> 04:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
clarify would be that if the uh property
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
owner loses at the planning board under
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph three they would still have
 
04:23:24.510 --> 04:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to either go through the
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
traditional appeal or even I suppose go
 
04:23:29.550 --> 04:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
through the traditional variance process
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
if they wish to do so so it would
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
preserve those mechanisms if they did
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
not succeed through the planning board
 
04:23:40.830 --> 04:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
process any other questions for Miss
 
04:23:40.840 --> 04:23:42.790 align:start position:0%
process any other questions for Miss

04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
Burns
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
04:23:51.309 --> 04:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
Klein thank you Mr chairman members of
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Drew Klein and
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
president of the Josiah barlot Center
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
for Public Policy New Hampshire's free
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
market Think Tank we've done a lot of
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
research on zoning and have been heavily
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
involved in this in the last few years
 
04:24:05.109 --> 04:24:05.119 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to um chime in on this
 
04:24:07.109 --> 04:24:07.119 align:start position:0%
bill without you know endorsing every
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
single um aspect line by line of it I
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
think the concept is um
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
is welcome uh one of the major
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
justifications as you guys know for
 
04:24:21.469 --> 04:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
zoning is to um prohibit negative
 
04:24:23.149 --> 04:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
externalities right so you're going to
 
04:24:27.189 --> 04:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
try to prevent um a a cost being opposed
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
on your neighbor and the problem with
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
the way it's done in top down zoning is
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
that you do sort of lock in these uses
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
and Zoning changes over time as you all
 
04:24:41.229 --> 04:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
know so the Manchester example from
 
04:24:43.269 --> 04:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative laog as a great example
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
and we have examples of from a lot of
 
04:24:47.950 --> 04:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
the older towns in New Hampshire and
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
really all throughout New England where
 
04:24:50.950 --> 04:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
beautiful pre- zoning Village or town or
 
04:24:59.229 --> 04:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
even larger segment of the town and then
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
that is frozen in time because later
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
zoning was built up around it and then
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
you have an example where you've got
 
04:25:10.030 --> 04:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
somebody with a lot that is perfectly
 
04:25:12.309 --> 04:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable to build a home that look
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
looks like the rest of the
 
04:25:17.670 --> 04:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it may even be exactly like
 
04:25:19.109 --> 04:25:19.119 align:start position:0%
the rest of the neighborhood for example
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these older communities do have
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh duplexes or triplexes right next to
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
single family homes and they've been
 
04:25:28.510 --> 04:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
there for literally over a century
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes more and yet it's illegal to
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
build that one lot over the way we
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
currently do our top- down zoning so the
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
concept of this bill is it switches that
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
to sort of bottom up so it takes in the
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
account of the currently built
 
04:25:45.790 --> 04:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
environment and I think that's the real
 
04:25:47.710 --> 04:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
strength of this legislation it looks at
 
04:25:50.269 --> 04:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
the currently built environment and says
 
04:25:53.790 --> 04:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the th000 Ft if it
 
04:25:56.590 --> 04:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
conforms with 90% of the currently built
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
environment in terms of density then
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
that should be an allowable build
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
without a variance and I think that's
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
the really important part here is it's
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
allowed by right just for two of those
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh factors so you can still have other
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
factors apply that you might have to get
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
a variance for but for the two listed in
 
04:26:13.640 --> 04:26:14.349 align:start position:0%
a variance for but for the two listed in
the

04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
bill if that's all it's pinging then you
 
04:26:19.389 --> 04:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
can build it by Riot and I think that
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is um
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood Conformity that's been one
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the biggest complaints or the biggest
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
resistances to changing zoning um so
 
04:26:30.630 --> 04:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
this one seems to be in pretty good
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
sweet spot in trying to keep that
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
neighborhood Conformity while allowing
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
some flexibility so we think it's a
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
positive development think it would lead
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
to some um good neighborhood
 
04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
consistent um development in addressing
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
a housing problem so questions for Mr
 
04:26:53.070 --> 04:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
Klein um my question is the density
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
Conformity assessment do you are you do
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
you know about those and can you talk to
 
04:26:58.469 --> 04:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
me a little bit about what's required
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
with one of those yeah I we've done just
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
a minor bit of research on that because
 
04:27:03.309 --> 04:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
it hasn't come up before in New
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the way that we've wanted
 
04:27:06.510 --> 04:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
to address so I wouldn't want to get too
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
much in the details of of research we we
 
04:27:11.550 --> 04:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
have looked at some other cities so um
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
there have been cities around the
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
country that from from cities as large
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
as I think Denver and La have tried
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
something not exactly this bill but sort
 
04:27:22.109 --> 04:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
of um looking at that sort of densing
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
Conformity thing um Asheville North
 
04:27:26.149 --> 04:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
Carolina has taken a bit of an approach
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
sort of like that to try to get to the
 
04:27:29.710 --> 04:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
same sort of thing we're still sort of
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what the Asheville
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
results are that was changed in 2017 but
 
04:27:37.469 --> 04:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to get like decree one
 
04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
way or the other on it but it but it is
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
something that's going around the
 
04:27:43.389 --> 04:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
country as a way to address the top down
 
04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
problem so you're seeing a lot of it
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's not entirely
 
04:27:52.030 --> 04:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
new represent Howen really quick one so
 
04:27:54.429 --> 04:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
does that the ruler the whatever you're
 
04:27:56.309 --> 04:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
going to pick in terms of like how big
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
it is sure does that only apply within
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
that zone so in other words the problem
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
would be is if let's suppose I had a uh
 
04:28:09.149 --> 04:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
a residential Zone that I have like half
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
acre or quarter acre lots and it butts
 
04:28:14.910 --> 04:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
against like another Zone and the spirit
 
04:28:17.229 --> 04:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
of your ordinance really was the next
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
Zone was a conservation subdivision it
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
was more Rural and if I'm able to reach
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
out with my thousand foot ruler and I
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
can cross over to the next Zone in the
 
04:28:28.590 --> 04:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
rural zone or or I'm in the rural Zone I
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
cross back over the other one and say
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
look I should be able to build that
 
04:28:34.590 --> 04:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
house it conforms to to that that thing
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
but it's not in the same Zone it's not
 
04:28:38.590 --> 04:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of zoning yeah so I I hear
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I think the intent of
 
04:28:42.830 --> 04:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
doing it this way is is that again
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
you're capturing the neighborhood right
 
04:28:47.710 --> 04:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
so part of the problem with zoning is
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's rigid and it's line bound so you
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
can have a beautiful neighborhood on one
 
04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
side of this line and a neighborhood on
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
the other that are right beside each
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
other it can even be the same
 
04:29:03.149 --> 04:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhood but you've just simply
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
drawn an and they are arbitrary often
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
you've just drawn an arbitrary line and
 
04:29:08.750 --> 04:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
said okay we're going to decide that
 
04:29:10.590 --> 04:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
this side of that line you can only
 
04:29:12.309 --> 04:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
build X on this side you can only build
 
04:29:13.950 --> 04:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
X and it ignores the neighborhood
 
04:29:16.870 --> 04:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
character so the advantage of doing it
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
this way with the Thousand ft is that
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
you're getting rid of the more rigid
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
arbitrary lines and you're making it um
 
04:29:27.550 --> 04:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
more of a neighborhood look and I think
 
04:29:28.950 --> 04:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
that I think there's a real advantage to
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
that rather than just forcing these
 
04:29:36.750 --> 04:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
with set okay no other questions thank
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Klein thank you um last up is
 
04:29:42.760 --> 04:29:51.349 align:start position:0%
you Mr Klein thank you um last up is
Sarah

04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
Holland good afternoon Sarah Holland New
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors um we
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
are here in support of this bill um I I
 
04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
won't repeat some of the
 
04:30:05.229 --> 04:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
um some of the items that were already
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned but when it comes to
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
zoning folks sometimes selfish exclude
 
04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
because it is a long process sometimes
 
04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
to get that variance that they're
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
looking for and it's not a guarantee
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility so folks will go
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
through um the application process they
 
04:30:27.870 --> 04:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
will um sit through hearings they may do
 
04:30:30.269 --> 04:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
designs expend money and time just for a
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
maybe this would be an opportunity for
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
them to look around their neighborhood
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
and go oh I see this I might be able to
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
do this here um there are still the
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
requirements that they do um the density
 
04:30:47.149 --> 04:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
Conformity assessment whatever we are
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
deciding that that is going to be going
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
forward um to prove kind of their point
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it does align with
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
what is happening in the neighborhood
 
04:30:56.269 --> 04:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
but this is one of those bold moves that
 
04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
we need to do to move the needle on
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
housing and to create more opportunities
 
04:31:02.109 --> 04:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
and create that infill that we're
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
looking for as opposed to creating new
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that require um uh New
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
Roads new Bridges new amenities um and I
 
04:31:13.870 --> 04:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
will remind you that most recently the
 
04:31:17.670 --> 04:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
median sale price in New Hampshire was
 
04:31:21.109 --> 04:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
$514,000 um and the average household
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
only makes 58% of what is needed to
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
afford that median income median
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
purchase price so we do need more
 
04:31:30.189 --> 04:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
housing and this is a a common sense
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
approach to be able to do so happy to
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions other questions for
 
04:31:33.960 --> 04:31:34.950 align:start position:0%
take any questions other questions for
the

04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
committee thank you thank
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
you um so I just want to gauge the
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee's appetite on this bill I I
 
04:31:42.429 --> 04:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
think personally it needs a little bit
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
of work but um is there any interest in
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
creating a small subcommittee to look at
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
04:31:53.149 --> 04:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
Paige I would be okay with that
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
yep yeah okay um so I'll just need
 
04:31:58.269 --> 04:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
members from both parties on there so
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'll just take volunteers for it I want
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
all on there representative Allen
 
04:32:02.040 --> 04:32:03.349 align:start position:0%
all on there representative Allen
representative

04:32:03.349 --> 04:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
Dumont representative
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
Boris representative
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
Grant and representative Gibbs
 
04:32:15.550 --> 04:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
okay so would you like to serve as well
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh what would like what would the
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
overall commitment be just because I'm
 
04:32:19.229 --> 04:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
coming from Littleton it's kind of a
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
commute for me well so a subcommittee
 
04:32:22.590 --> 04:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be noticed 24 hours ahead of
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
time um it basically you the the
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
committee would get together and really
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
discuss um how to formulate this into a
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
workable document for the committee uh
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
we have until this isn't an early bill
 
04:32:36.870 --> 04:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we have until um march to really get
 
04:32:38.670 --> 04:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
this done so um it could take one
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
meeting could take two could take as
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
many as the committee desires but
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
um with that I just want to ask if
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I would be interested
 
04:32:48.189 --> 04:32:48.199 align:start position:0%
because I think it is really important
 
04:32:50.309 --> 04:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay so with that I'm going to um
 
04:32:51.630 --> 04:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
appoint a subcommittee representative
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
Howen will you chair that committee all
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
right we're going to put representative
 
04:32:56.670 --> 04:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
howand in charge with those um six
 
04:32:58.189 --> 04:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
members representative Dumont Grant
 
04:33:03.070 --> 04:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
borus bolo and Gibbs and with that I'm
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
going to recess or close the public

board chairman on the planning board
 
04:34:05.310 --> 04:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
there on the zoning board also water
 
04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner and also on City Council in

Homer Alaska for three terms there and
 
04:34:13.709 --> 04:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
dealt with a lot of these issues which
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with dealing with housing
 
04:34:18.869 --> 04:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
and to start with I'd like to read just
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
one sentence that came from governor aot
 
04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
in her inaugural address several shorts
 
04:34:27.390 --> 04:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
weeks ago Governor aot stated in her
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
inaugural address quote if we're going
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
to remain the economic Beacon of New
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
England we need to start by tackling our
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we need to get serious
 
04:34:40.990 --> 04:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
about housing production streamline
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
state agent gency approvals and partner
 
04:34:45.869 --> 04:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
with our local
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
communities that's just not a message
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
for our state in terms of our government
 
04:34:54.990 --> 04:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and departments and bureaus
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
it's a message for our local
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well the housing
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
crisis in the area where I'm living
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
right now is
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
horrendous our property taxes have just
 
04:35:08.429 --> 04:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
been doubled the rates supposed to go
 
04:35:10.990 --> 04:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
down proportionately uhuh they didn't
 
04:35:12.510 --> 04:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
and we're going to see things going
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
higher and higher so we're being tapped
 
04:35:16.910 --> 04:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
out but there for the young people we're
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
trying to attract on the Upper Valley
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
area it's very difficult for them to
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
find housing right now it's just not
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
available and we need young blood in
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
that Community as we do all through this
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
state so the bill that you have before
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
you is an attempt to try to streamline
 
04:35:40.510 --> 04:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
and put in a fourth um fourth element
 
04:35:43.390 --> 04:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
there in terms of how we issue building
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
permits off of private
 
04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
roads the private road permitting
 
04:35:51.990 --> 04:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
process can be unduly long costly and
 
04:35:54.429 --> 04:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
may delay in push construction as I've
 
04:35:56.269 --> 04:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
seen many times when I've been dealing
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
with this to a later season so
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
contractors miss that next season or the
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
season they're in and it's often times
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
delayed because the regulations and all
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
the roadblocks that are put forth in the
 
04:36:09.400 --> 04:36:10.551 align:start position:0%
the roadblocks that are put forth in the
planning

04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
planning
 
04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
board and we're talking about building
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
and getting permits off of that private
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
road so this legislation drives at the
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
idea that if the
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
municipality has approved a policy
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with building and building
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
issuing permits off a private road then
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
the permit for erecting a building uh
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
buildings off of that built private road
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
may be done by the governing body and
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
after review and comment by the planning
 
04:36:47.629 --> 04:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
board doesn't say
 
04:36:49.629 --> 04:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
approval and the issuance of the
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
building permit can move forward I
 
04:36:54.510 --> 04:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
believe that is a process if you're in
 
04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
compliance and you've dealt with all
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
those issues drainage e access to the
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
the highway you're trying to get on to
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh gradient uh slope all those issues
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
that planning boards look at I believe
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
that can be handled through policy so um
 
04:37:12.750 --> 04:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go any further on this
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
CU I basically stated what I'm trying to
 
04:37:16.750 --> 04:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
do here I know there's others behind me
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
which um are anxious to speak on this uh
 
04:37:24.109 --> 04:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
I've in doing this I'm not doing it as a
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
result of being contacted from people in
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
the hail area I've been contacted by
 
04:37:31.709 --> 04:37:31.719 align:start position:0%
people farther down the river and south
 
04:37:34.990 --> 04:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
of Hanover Lebanon area wishing and to
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
do the development but being styed by
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
the delays and time it takes to get
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
these permits and and and again once
 
04:37:45.510 --> 04:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
again it's all about our housing whether
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
it be for the retired individual who
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
needs to you know uh drop scale down to
 
04:37:53.629 --> 04:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
a house that's more affordable for them
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
or whether it's for the new person
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
moving into our community or just
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
anybody that needs to have housing that
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
can't find it and so that's what this is
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
about and I will stop right here and uh
 
04:38:08.310 --> 04:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
rather than taking those technical
 
04:38:10.830 --> 04:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
questions shoot them to the people that
 
04:38:13.150 --> 04:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
you know you know I I've talked to other
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys that're behind me here and and
 
04:38:16.590 --> 04:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
they have some ideas well this is how
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
you might amend the bill and all that um
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
the scope in which I'd like to see it
 
04:38:22.590 --> 04:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
pass is the scope that I provided to you
 
04:38:24.429 --> 04:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
right here dink with it a little bit if
 
04:38:27.150 --> 04:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
you want but uh have
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%

one hey um I will now call on George
Hansel

04:38:45.470 --> 04:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.990 --> 04:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman my name
 
04:38:49.830 --> 04:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
is George Hansel I'm from Keane I was a
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
planning board member for more than 10
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
years there I was the mayor of Kean I
 
04:38:55.869 --> 04:38:55.879 align:start position:0%
was a city councelor in Keane seen a lot
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
of permits come through the city a lot
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
of development happened I'm also a small
 
04:39:03.150 --> 04:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
scale developer my partner and I do
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
about 40 units of new housing a year is
 
04:39:08.830 --> 04:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
what we sort of shoot for and in all my
 
04:39:12.551 --> 04:39:12.561 align:start position:0%
time as uh involved in local government
 
04:39:14.590 --> 04:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
and in development I had never run
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
across this issue of of building on a
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
private road until last year and we had
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh an infill project we were building
 
04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
three duplexes close to downtown keen
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
and it happened to be one of these old
 
04:39:28.750 --> 04:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
Legacy private roads that we had never
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
run into before and the city staff and I
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
sort of work through this process to
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
comply with the current RSA and what it
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
required was a whole additional level of
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
approval through a planning board and
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
then to the city council and it was
 
04:39:46.830 --> 04:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an awkward situation because
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
we got through those hearings and
 
04:39:50.670 --> 04:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
attempted to comply with the current law
 
04:39:52.230 --> 04:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
and there was nothing really there for
 
04:39:54.510 --> 04:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
them to dig their teeth into I had to go
 
04:39:56.670 --> 04:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
before my former colleagues and say I've
 
04:39:59.910 --> 04:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
got this great project um and I need
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
your approval and they're sort of like
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
well approval for what are you going to
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
file the the uh the appropriate forms
 
04:40:08.830 --> 04:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
with the um County at the County
 
04:40:10.270 --> 04:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
Register of Deeds to say that you're
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for the road all that stuff
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm like yes um and there wasn't
 
04:40:17.310 --> 04:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
much else the only advice I had for my
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the city council and the planning
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
board to give me my approval was some
 
04:40:24.830 --> 04:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
research I had done on other um other
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
construction on private roads in New
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and looking at the minutes of
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
those meetings where those uh local
 
04:40:33.030 --> 04:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
governing bodies were looking at this
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
and they came back to the fact they were
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
just really basically looking to make
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
sure that emergency vehicles could
 
04:40:41.390 --> 04:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
access these these places so if you
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
built an apartment on a private road
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure that their
 
04:40:48.070 --> 04:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services could get there um so
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be the Crux of it
 
04:40:53.628 --> 04:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
and I got through my process our project
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
is actually almost almost complete and
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to be occupied in the next couple
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
of weeks but this brought up another
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
issue and I think while in my experience
 
04:41:03.948 --> 04:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
this building on private roads is
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a rare occurrence I think
 
04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's going to become more uh prevalent
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
mainly because in the city of and other
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are looking to
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
expand opportunity to construct housing
 
04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
they're coming up with new ideas to
 
04:41:20.430 --> 04:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
build that housing um in Keen we have
 
04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
what's called a Cottage Court ordinance
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
which allows for cluster development uh
 
04:41:27.788 --> 04:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
to try and create infill opportunities
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
and opportunities to build more housing
 
04:41:31.628 --> 04:41:31.638 align:start position:0%
and each one of those cluster
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
developments uh is going to have a
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
private road and so anyone who wants to
 
04:41:37.070 --> 04:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
build that is going to have to go
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
through the same process that I just did
 
04:41:41.310 --> 04:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
with this somewhat redundant level of
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
oversight and so um I applaud
 
04:41:45.868 --> 04:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
representative lad for putting this
 
04:41:47.470 --> 04:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
forward I think this is a good step in
 
04:41:48.910 --> 04:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
the right direction to try and
 
04:41:51.628 --> 04:41:51.638 align:start position:0%
streamline things um what you have here
 
04:41:52.990 --> 04:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
is legislation that I think was
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
originally created to protect the
 
04:41:56.948 --> 04:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities from liability having to
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
do with people constructing roads and
 
04:42:01.150 --> 04:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
then trying to get the municipality to
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
take care of them or be liable for
 
04:42:05.628 --> 04:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
injuries that happen on those roads I
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that changing this
 
04:42:08.310 --> 04:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
legislation in the way that's being
 
04:42:10.948 --> 04:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
proposed is going to impact that at all
 
04:42:12.310 --> 04:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
and I would actually encourage the
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this legislation
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
now as an opportunity for new ways to
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
build housing in the state of New
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I know that places like
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
the city of Kean are looking to do that
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I encourage you to pass this and uh
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions if
 
04:42:29.070 --> 04:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you any questions
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
for Mr Hansel representative Howen then
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
representative Grant so so do you think
 
04:42:34.110 --> 04:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
I mean it's kind of interesting in your
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
testimony do you think really with
 
04:42:37.750 --> 04:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
private roads and this is full
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
disclosure I have a cabin on a private
 
04:42:43.390 --> 04:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
road at the base of the Bell naaps are
 
04:42:45.190 --> 04:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
you thinking more towards existing
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
private roads because if you're going to
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
do new developments with a cottage
 
04:42:50.270 --> 04:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
cluster you you you probably don't want
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
to build a private road you probably
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to build a regular Road and I think
 
04:42:56.350 --> 04:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
that when the your planning board is
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
doing your subdivision regulations
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to lay it all out and then
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
you really want your municipality to
 
04:43:06.430 --> 04:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
accept that as a real Road just so it
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
would cover all the things that you just
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
said it the cost would be there you'd
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
make sure that it met for like emergency
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles you could get a garbage truck
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
down there and so while I can see the
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
streamlining of process it wouldn't you
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
want to streamline the the process on
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
the existing roads that you had those
 
04:43:26.590 --> 04:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
Legacy roads and not build New Roads
 
04:43:29.110 --> 04:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
that complicate your life or build new
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
develop I can see the advantage of both
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
I mean ideally yes you'd build the road
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the city standards and and hand it
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
over them for them to take care of but
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
what I see in the future is a lot more
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
planed unit developments and and um and
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's always necessary to
 
04:43:45.990 --> 04:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
hand it over to the municipality I also
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
in my experience the municipalities are
 
04:43:50.990 --> 04:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
usually hesitant to take on New New
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
Roads because it's more square footage
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
for them to take care of it's a it's a
 
04:43:57.788 --> 04:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
future liability and so um the
 
04:43:59.788 --> 04:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
willingness of the developer to M and
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
and eventually the community that has
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
that housing to to retain and take care
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
of that road is just going to help them
 
04:44:10.390 --> 04:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh expedite that process if they don't
 
04:44:11.948 --> 04:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
have to hand it over they don't have to
 
04:44:15.030 --> 04:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate anything they can just move
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
forward represent
 
04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
Grant thank you Mr chairman so I'm I'm a
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
bit confused here so you have a private
 
04:44:25.510 --> 04:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
road who owns the property on each side
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
of that private road is it one owner not
 
04:44:32.550 --> 04:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily it could be uh but not
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily okay so in your case in Kean
 
04:44:37.070 --> 04:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
was it one owner that owned that there
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
were three Parcels that were had
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
Frontage on that private road Ro that
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
already had furn so there were already
 
04:44:46.350 --> 04:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
lots of record per se and there were
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
existing buildings there so we were just
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
actually adding a new a new building and
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
we had to go through this whole process
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
so you're building private units is and
 
04:44:56.910 --> 04:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
you're selling those is that what you're
 
04:45:00.590 --> 04:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
doing uh we build them to rent or uh to
 
04:45:02.948 --> 04:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
sell yep all right so you don't have to
 
04:45:04.510 --> 04:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
have like an association that's going to
 
04:45:06.030 --> 04:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
take care of that road I mean don't you
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
have to form an association that anybody
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
on that road is going to help maintain
 
04:45:12.550 --> 04:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
that road so in this case it would be
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
the shared responsibility of the
 
04:45:17.230 --> 04:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
property owners to take care of the road
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
so you you're kind of in since you're
 
04:45:22.948 --> 04:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
Sur venting the subdivision process
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
right in this case it wouldn't your
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't have created we couldn't have
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
created a subdivision because these were
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
already individual Lots with individual
 
04:45:33.470 --> 04:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
owners right but some of the private
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
roads that was one owner these are
 
04:45:37.948 --> 04:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
followups right but a a Cottage Court
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
and this is important because it's not a
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
Cottage Court when likely be a
 
04:45:43.390 --> 04:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
traditional subdivision it would
 
04:45:45.628 --> 04:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
probably be one developer that came in
 
04:45:48.110 --> 04:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
and and ran the private road into the
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
development and then you'd have um
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
likely like a parking lot and then
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
buildings uh usually smaller scale
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
buildings off of that and it sort of
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
creates like a what's called a plan unit
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
development but it wouldn't necessarily
 
04:46:05.030 --> 04:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
be subdivided it could be one one whole
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
developer that that then lease the The
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
Cottages or the the uh the apartment to
 
04:46:12.990 --> 04:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
folks thank
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um do you think that it
 
04:46:24.070 --> 04:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea to amend this bill
 
04:46:28.750 --> 04:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
to require that um when building the con
 
04:46:31.230 --> 04:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
you when proposing the construction that
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
somebody spec that the owners specify
 
04:46:37.110 --> 04:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
who will be responsible that is whether
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be a particular owner such as your
 
04:46:43.310 --> 04:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
cottage owners or whether it'll be an
 
04:46:45.548 --> 04:46:45.558 align:start position:0%
association of everybody who lives on
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
that road because I could see if it's a
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
joint responsibility without anything
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
being specified that there would be a
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
lot of problems developing as who's
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to P the snowplow sure I think
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's already covered in the current
 
04:47:02.390 --> 04:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislation because you have to file a a
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
document um identifying the responsible
 
04:47:06.990 --> 04:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
party at the register of deeds and that
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
would attach with the the land on the
 
04:47:11.110 --> 04:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
road and we're not attempting to modify
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
that requirement at
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
all thank you for your question all
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
right seeing none others thank you Mr
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
Burns good afternoon Margaret Burns
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
Association we are in support of House
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 296 which we understand to be um a
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
separate another alternative to the
 
04:47:42.190 --> 04:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
manner in which building on private
 
04:47:45.070 --> 04:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
roads can be approved this being a
 
04:47:47.470 --> 04:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
policy adopted by the select board as
 
04:47:49.470 --> 04:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to going through the current
 
04:47:51.310 --> 04:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
existing process which is review by the
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
select board after review and comment by
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
the planning board I do have two
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
comments for your consideration one is
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
that I do believe that line four has a
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
typo I do believe it's supposed to read
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
that the private road
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
identified complies with the policy
 
04:48:12.910 --> 04:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
adopted Ed by the governing body um I
 
04:48:16.590 --> 04:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
think that's just a simple uh correction
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
my second comment is that if this is to
 
04:48:24.430 --> 04:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
be added to paragraph D1 and if you've
 
04:48:27.070 --> 04:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
ever read this statute it is a never
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
ending list of paragraphs and
 
04:48:33.628 --> 04:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
subparagraphs there is the paragraph
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
above it C1 is like a mirror image of D1
 
04:48:41.708 --> 04:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
but it applies to approving building on
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
class six roads which are public roads
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
that are not municipally maintained
 
04:48:51.868 --> 04:48:51.878 align:start position:0%
image and so there is probably logic If
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
This Were to pass an alter uh alter D1
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
that C1 should similarly be amended to
 
04:49:02.350 --> 04:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
have this alternative approval process
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh by governing body policy thank you
 
04:49:07.868 --> 04:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
that's helpful thank
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%

04:49:14.190 --> 04:49:14.200 align:start position:0%

letter and uh just to let you know who I
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
am I'm a lawyer my office main office is
 
04:49:56.190 --> 04:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
here in conquer down the street on on
 
04:50:00.670 --> 04:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
Park Street we have offices in Kean um
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and and uh Bedford when I and
 
04:50:06.430 --> 04:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
they just with actual lawyers in them
 
04:50:08.110 --> 04:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
I've been practicing for about 40 years
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
all that time in real estate I've
 
04:50:11.788 --> 04:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
represented Banks I've represented
 
04:50:14.190 --> 04:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
borrowers I've represented developers
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
I've here before planning boards zoning
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
boards of adjustment uh Boards of Select
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
select boards I was there at the corner
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
of uh Handover Street and Elm Street
 
04:50:27.310 --> 04:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
when the banks failed um wave to my
 
04:50:29.310 --> 04:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
friends over at Ms G Bank when the banks
 
04:50:30.430 --> 04:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
failed so we handled a lot of
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
foreclosures loan workouts dealt with
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office amending
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
the Condominium Act after that but the
 
04:50:38.910 --> 04:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
one constant in my practice and the
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm known for is Rose s it's
 
04:50:45.070 --> 04:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
a quirky area of the law but and
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
easements are also a part of that but
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
private roads class six roads class five
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
roads discontinued State highways
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
discontinued railroads who owns the land
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
who has what rights to use it
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues and building permits
 
04:51:03.628 --> 04:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
and um I should also say in a prior life
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
I was also Senate legal council so I'm
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
very familiar with this building
 
04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
although I haven't been here in probably
 
04:51:11.470 --> 04:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
about 25 years
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh but I this bill did catch my
 
04:51:15.708 --> 04:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
attention um and so I wanted to come
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
down and and offer some comments on it
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
because my clients are basically your
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
constituents constituents the people
 
04:51:24.548 --> 04:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
that I represent that proest are really
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
more the one-offs they have uh property
 
04:51:29.910 --> 04:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
on a uh one lot on a private road and
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
they try to get a building permit and
 
04:51:35.230 --> 04:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
the issue that uh they run into and why
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm actually I said that I was opposed
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
to the bill but I I think the concept is
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
a great concept because it is a problem
 
04:51:45.548 --> 04:51:45.558 align:start position:0%
that there's no criteria at all there's
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
no guidance for select boards as to as
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
to what decision how how they should
 
04:51:51.230 --> 04:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
approach these requests for building
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
permits except the one constant I've
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
seen is the maintenance issue and that's
 
04:51:58.910 --> 04:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
why I think if you simply narrow it down
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
to whether excuse me not the maintenance
 
04:52:03.070 --> 04:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
issue but the um whether or not
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle can access the lot and
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
as written what this bill would do is
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about it's going to
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
lead to a whole another body of law that
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
that lawyers and and applicants have to
 
04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
deal with we got zoning ordinances we
 
04:52:20.708 --> 04:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
got subdivision regulations we got site
 
04:52:22.868 --> 04:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
plan regulations we got building codes
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to have these things
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
called policies and uh I don't know what
 
04:52:30.390 --> 04:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
a policy is I don't know what strength
 
04:52:32.750 --> 04:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
it has to what extent uh someone could
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
challenge that but I am concerned about
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
that and I would suggest that you cut to
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Chase and simply have a one crit
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
which is can emergency vehicles get to
 
04:52:45.390 --> 04:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
the lot um I gave you some examples in
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
my letter of some of the crazy things
 
04:52:49.470 --> 04:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
that I've seen towns well due respect to
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
the people on the select boards but the
 
04:52:53.788 --> 04:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
things that are added to these notices
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
that get recorded all the all the law
 
04:52:58.510 --> 04:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
requires is a notice that says the
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
municipal acknowledgement the
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
municipality is not obligated to
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
maintain the road and not not liable for
 
04:53:06.430 --> 04:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
any damage that's it but the select
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
boards will throw in these additional
 
04:53:09.830 --> 04:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
I've seen other things too that I didn't
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
put in the letter but they'll throw in
 
04:53:14.750 --> 04:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
these additional things and so I I would
 
04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
the reason for my amendment is to
 
04:53:18.830 --> 04:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
simplify it cut to the chase if an Emer
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
if an emergency vehicle can get to the
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
lot that's it it could be a dirt road uh
 
04:53:26.030 --> 04:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a lot of private roads
 
04:53:28.628 --> 04:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of private roads and as you know
 
04:53:30.548 --> 04:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
and it was alluded to in the prior
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
testimony uh towns are hesitant to take
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
over maintenance of a road the cost to
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
maintain a road and I get that we run
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
into that all the time those kind of
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
those kind of uh situations
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
but if you want to
 
04:53:45.628 --> 04:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
preserve uh private roads you got to
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
give people the ability to build on them
 
04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
I think and all you have to do is make
 
04:53:52.030 --> 04:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
sure that uh emergency vehicles can get
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
there as far as maintenance goes you
 
04:53:56.990 --> 04:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
passed a statute 5 years ago it's RSA
 
04:53:59.310 --> 04:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
231 colon
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
881a RSA 231 colon
 
04:54:06.270 --> 04:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
881a and it requires people who live on
 
04:54:08.670 --> 04:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
private roads to contribute equitably
 
04:54:10.070 --> 04:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
toward the Roads Maintenance so you've
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
already got a statute on that um and if
 
04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
you had a development like Mr Hansel had
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
recommended then you'd have probably
 
04:54:17.948 --> 04:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
have covenants and would be you know it
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
would be part of the the approval
 
04:54:23.788 --> 04:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
process um so that's that's uh that's
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
really all I wanted to say I'm happy to
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and appreciate your
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
time thank you attorney Delon um
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative buo yes thank you Mr
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um so yes I recognize your name
 
04:54:35.310 --> 04:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm an attorney myself and I've
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
seen your advertisements in the bar news
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
every month so um thank you for um
 
04:54:41.788 --> 04:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
submitting this testimony I did have one
 
04:54:44.230 --> 04:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
question about the proposed amendment um
 
04:54:48.910 --> 04:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
the uh HB 296 as it's written says or
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
after and then your change um says and
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
after and I'm wondering should it be and
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
or should it be
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
or well it could um I did intend it as
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
written that it would be so the current
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
process is the local governing body
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
let's say the selectman they get review
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
and comment from the planning board um
 
04:55:11.110 --> 04:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
vote um I guess you could it could be an
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
or I mean if you wanted to you could
 
04:55:18.788 --> 04:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
bypass the planning board part and I'll
 
04:55:22.270 --> 04:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
be frank too I most of the time this
 
04:55:24.070 --> 04:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
select boards don't bother with the
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
planning board part they're sort of
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with this statute and as
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
someone said earlier it's a it's a tough
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
statute it's a it's a tough read um but
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
I would think or would be would be fine
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
yeah well if you just to follow that
 
04:55:39.868 --> 04:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
logic if you say and you're adding
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
another step to the process and I think
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
that goes against yeah it's a good point
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah what I was trying to do was to um
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
as originally written you're going to
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
have these new policies so you're
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
sending this off to Pol policies to be
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
you know created and you have to make
 
04:55:58.350 --> 04:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
sure they comply with the policies what
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
I was trying to do is to limit that part
 
04:56:01.868 --> 04:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
but I think that's actually a good idea
 
04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
if you put the put the or then you uh
 
04:56:07.070 --> 04:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
you can make it even simpler the process
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
yeah great any other representative
 
04:56:13.548 --> 04:56:13.558 align:start position:0%
Howen just one quick clarification so um
 
04:56:15.390 --> 04:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
you can you get the building permit as
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
long as you can get emergency vehicles
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
down the road and it complies with all
 
04:56:22.548 --> 04:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
your local building codes right I mean
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
all your setbacks your Heights all that
 
04:56:27.830 --> 04:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
Absolut so that so in in addition to
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
that requirement that it's consistent
 
04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.230 --> 04:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
yeah no other questions thank you and if
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
you could fill out a pin card for us
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
that'd be great any other other um
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
people wishing to testify on HB um
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%

444 and recognize the prime sponsor
 
04:56:59.470 --> 04:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative Reed welcome back to the
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
housing thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:57:03.440 --> 04:57:04.350 align:start position:0%
housing thank you Mr chair thank you
fellow

04:57:04.350 --> 04:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
fellow
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
members um my name is alen Reed I
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 that's new
 
04:57:11.470 --> 04:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
market and Newfield
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
um so we've talked a lot about landlord
 
04:57:16.470 --> 04:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
tenant issues here and this is
 
04:57:17.788 --> 04:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
technically landlord tenant because it's
 
04:57:19.430 --> 04:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
requiring something of a landlord very
 
04:57:22.030 --> 04:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
very minor but really what I want to
 
04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
talk about is ownership not renting
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
because when we talk about the housing
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
crisis and it is the biggest crisis in
 
04:57:32.150 --> 04:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
this state we talk a lot about renting
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you renting isn't really
 
04:57:37.590 --> 04:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
going to fix all of our wos because even
 
04:57:39.628 --> 04:57:39.638 align:start position:0%
before we were here where we are now we
 
04:57:42.190 --> 04:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
had a R of New Hampshire crisis because
 
04:57:44.548 --> 04:57:44.558 align:start position:0%
we couldn't attract or keep working
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
class and working age people in this
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
state because the vast majority of
 
04:57:51.788 --> 04:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
people and I know that people will be
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
like no some people want to rent the
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people want to own a
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
home they want to own it's a very
 
04:58:00.548 --> 04:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
animalistic thing like you have your Den
 
04:58:02.708 --> 04:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
you have your territory that you're safe
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
where you don't have to worry about a
 
04:58:05.788 --> 04:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
landlord and what the landlord can and
 
04:58:08.030 --> 04:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
cannot do to you and it will they kick
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
you out at the end of 12 months and what
 
04:58:13.390 --> 04:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
have you you owning is the gold standard
 
04:58:16.510 --> 04:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
for every metric in a community
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
communities that have high home
 
04:58:21.548 --> 04:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
ownership rates do better than
 
04:58:23.590 --> 04:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
communities that are more affluent but
 
04:58:25.948 --> 04:58:25.958 align:start position:0%
have higher rental rates because the
 
04:58:27.548 --> 04:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
people in that Community are more
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
invested even if it's be be it ever so
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
humble right even if it's humble they're
 
04:58:36.750 --> 04:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
invested in their communities so we are
 
04:58:40.270 --> 04:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
doing a disservice to this state if we
 
04:58:43.708 --> 04:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
are not talking seriously about how to
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
increase home ownership
 
04:58:51.310 --> 04:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
rates in the 80s a very loow hanging
 
04:58:53.708 --> 04:58:53.718 align:start position:0%
piece of fruit was taken I think it was
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
1988 if I'm not mistaken and all it did
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
it was is what it said is that an owner
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
of a manufactured housing Park if he's
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to sell the park needs to give his
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
tenants 60 days notice before closing to
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
allow his tenants if they want if they
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
so choose to come together as a
 
04:59:15.070 --> 04:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative even though they're
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
lowincome and be able to finance and put
 
04:59:21.548 --> 04:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
in an offer a competing offer it's not a
 
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
right of first refusal the landlord
 
04:59:25.310 --> 04:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to accept it he just has to
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
allow 60 days notice to give them the
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to decide whether they want
 
04:59:33.548 --> 04:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
to try to buy their own property now
 
04:59:36.150 --> 04:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a a little bit of
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
nothing to me but it is that little tiny
 
04:59:41.948 --> 04:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
change has has produced over 200
 
04:59:43.868 --> 04:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities Each of which
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
have dozens of
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners and the the Manufacturing
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
Housing parks that became resident-owned
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
compared to the ones that have not they
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
have lower lot rents and higher
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
quality wow we were able to turn a bunch
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
of lowincome people who were renting
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
into homeowners thousands of them
 
05:00:05.948 --> 05:00:05.958 align:start position:0%
thousands of them an amazingly
 
05:00:09.548 --> 05:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
successful program with one tiny little
 
05:00:09.558 --> 05:00:10.470 align:start position:0%
successful program with one tiny little
thing

05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
60 days notice before final sale all
 
05:00:14.910 --> 05:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
right so all I've done in this is say
 
05:00:17.230 --> 05:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
okay cool compared to the number of
 
05:00:18.990 --> 05:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks we have we
 
05:00:21.948 --> 05:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
have tons of multif family houses way
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
more and in other states there are
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
cooperatives in multif family
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
housing let's give it a go let's do that
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
60-day notice for multif family housing
 
05:00:34.310 --> 05:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
only restricted properties of five units
 
05:00:35.788 --> 05:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
or more so if it's like a little
 
05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
fourplex or duplex you're exempt you
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
but let's give them an opportunity to
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
just decide again nobody's forcing them
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
just decide oh wow I'm going to get a
 
05:00:49.548 --> 05:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
new landl Lord someone's going to buy
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
it do you want to go co-op with me you
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
want to own this there are many by the
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
way um many different forms of Co-op um
 
05:00:59.708 --> 05:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
there's nonprofit trusts and other types
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
of trusts there's condo isation um
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's many different forms and this
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
allows them an opportunity to choose
 
05:01:09.310 --> 05:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
which organization to work with um if
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
they want to
 
05:01:13.470 --> 05:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
even do it which form of Co-op they want
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
to choose but at the end of the day if
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
they choose it then they put an offer
 
05:01:19.868 --> 05:01:19.878 align:start position:0%
and if it's a competing offer and that's
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know something that the landlord
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
sees as beneficial to
 
05:01:27.150 --> 05:01:27.160 align:start position:0%
them they own their homes that's what we
 
05:01:30.350 --> 05:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
need to be doing here in this state home
 
05:01:32.670 --> 05:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
ownership and home ownership not just
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
for people who can afford a
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
$500,000 man mcmansion on a five acre
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
lot home ownership
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
be it ever so
 
05:01:43.440 --> 05:01:45.670 align:start position:0%
be it ever so
humble

05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
humble
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
so what I've heard and by the way I'm
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
I'm having direct experience with this
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
right now because I'm helping a
 
05:01:53.070 --> 05:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing community in
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
Danville go Co-op they just like not
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
even two weeks ago voted to uh go Co-op
 
05:02:03.030 --> 05:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:06.910 --> 05:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
million so the push back I've heard last
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
time I put this bill in and some of the
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
emails that we have received is that it
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
is very very onerous for the person
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
selling to have to wait 60 days now
 
05:02:19.230 --> 05:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
normally with most
 
05:02:22.110 --> 05:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
um transfer of per private property
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
deals it takes a few months to close you
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
need inspections you need lawyers you
 
05:02:28.948 --> 05:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
need the whole there's a whole process
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
and so two months really isn't that big
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
a deal the very specific example given
 
05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
is what if the person isn't actually
 
05:02:38.270 --> 05:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
intending to sell because if they're
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
intending to sell they can just give the
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
notice right then in there they put it
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
on the market they give their tenants
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
notice boom they'll be fine but what if
 
05:02:46.868 --> 05:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
someone they weren't intending to sell
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
and someone comes and gives them a cash
 
05:02:50.548 --> 05:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
offer well that might happen a lot that
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
closes a lot faster
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
right okay worst case scenario because
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
these the again is five units or more
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
right so we're talking about most likely
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
structures that have a a value of over a
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
million dollars maybe several million
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
dollars so worst case scenario we are um
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh making someone wait a few weeks to
 
05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
give their tenants a chance to be
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
homeowners a few weeks on their
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar deal I don't think
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's a big deal
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
I I'll get back to this because I want
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
to address a few other things but just
 
05:03:28.750 --> 05:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
put a pin in that concept okay you're
 
05:03:30.310 --> 05:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
making them wait a few extra weeks
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's such a tiny ask to to address
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
home ownership thousands of manufactured
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
housing homes are now home own or home
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
are homeowners right how many more if it
 
05:03:43.788 --> 05:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
was multif
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
family but some of the other issues um
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
well what if they don't want to if they
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to they don't do it it's not
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
a big deal um what if well if they
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to own well wouldn't they have
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
just bought a condo well no right now
 
05:03:59.910 --> 05:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
you can't buy anything right now you
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
can't hardly find anything that's even
 
05:04:04.510 --> 05:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
vacant and available to to to be bought
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
but in the case that you can you
 
05:04:07.310 --> 05:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
certainly can't find one that's
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
affordable and so no but also some
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
people won't want to and then they get
 
05:04:14.910 --> 05:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
to sell that's amazing now they're a
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
homeowner and they get to sell and leave
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
right and then they can go rent or they
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
can say no that they don't want to be go
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
go Co-op again it's up to
 
05:04:27.030 --> 05:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
them um another one was uh isn't there a
 
05:04:29.110 --> 05:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
difference between manufactured housing
 
05:04:31.150 --> 05:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
Parks which are separate units on a
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
shared land and a multif family house
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
which are units that are attached on a
 
05:04:37.788 --> 05:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
shared land yeah there are some but
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
there's co-ops of multif family housing
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
in other places there's HOAs that apply
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
to buildings have multiple units as well
 
05:04:47.948 --> 05:04:47.958 align:start position:0%
as uh property that has single family
 
05:04:51.070 --> 05:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
units so I don't see the differences as
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
that um pertinent to this
 
05:04:56.990 --> 05:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill and another thing is even if they
 
05:04:59.628 --> 05:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to go Co-op I have two
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
stories from people tenants in my town
 
05:05:06.868 --> 05:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
of New Market one was uh these are both
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh groups of tenants that found out that
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
building had sold a after it had sold so
 
05:05:14.070 --> 05:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
they oh I didn't even know I had a new
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
landlord until I got noticed that my
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
rent's going up one was the new the the
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
person buying had basically pretended
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
that he was a neighbor and had an AB
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
buding piece of property and went to one
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
of the tenants and asked um for the
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
landlord's number so he could ask the
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
landlord questions about this tree which
 
05:05:36.910 --> 05:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
was maybe on this property or that
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
property turns out it was just someone
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
who wanted the landlord's information so
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
that they could he could go he went to
 
05:05:44.110 --> 05:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
his house during dinner time to
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
aggressively give him an offer 50% over
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
asking price so that he could then turn
 
05:05:50.830 --> 05:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
around and raise the rents three times
 
05:05:52.910 --> 05:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
what they were paying that's what
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
happened in that case the other scenario
 
05:05:58.750 --> 05:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
was a a buyer that gained access to look
 
05:06:00.910 --> 05:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
at the units by claiming he was an
 
05:06:00.920 --> 05:06:02.750 align:start position:0%
at the units by claiming he was an
insurance

05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
adjuster so even if you don't want to go
 
05:06:08.750 --> 05:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
Co-op and you want to rent and you
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
decide to turn on the offer to go Co-op
 
05:06:13.708 --> 05:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
and put in an offer of your own you
 
05:06:16.548 --> 05:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
still want to know when your building's
 
05:06:18.990 --> 05:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
going to be sold right instead of being
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
lied to and manipulated and then
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
surprise surprise you have a new
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.548 --> 05:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
300% and one thing I did not highlight
 
05:06:32.548 --> 05:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
the last year when this was in was um
 
05:06:36.788 --> 05:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
the fact that this benefits the seller
 
05:06:39.628 --> 05:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
the landlord if you have more than one
 
05:06:41.470 --> 05:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
entity putting an offer in on your
 
05:06:44.030 --> 05:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
property that benefits you if you have
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
an offer for $1 million and then the
 
05:06:48.230 --> 05:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
tenants go Co-op and they put in 18.5
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
million in hopes that you take their
 
05:06:51.830 --> 05:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
offer and then this person puts in
 
05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
another offer you get competing offers
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have a bidding war that helps the
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
seller I don't understand why anyone
 
05:07:01.628 --> 05:07:01.638 align:start position:0%
would be against this and in fact in 40
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
years of this being in place in law
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
there's been no significant complaints
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
from manufactured housing Park owners
 
05:07:11.470 --> 05:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
this has not been onerous no one's tried
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
to repeal the law no one's coming
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
complaining that oh my God I had to give
 
05:07:17.670 --> 05:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
notice 60 days before closing this was
 
05:07:17.680 --> 05:07:20.110 align:start position:0%
notice 60 days before closing this was
so

05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
terrible so I'm going to go back to the
 
05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
point that I said put a pin in because I
 
05:07:29.070 --> 05:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
think very often in this
 
05:07:32.350 --> 05:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
building we as legislators were kind of
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
like the analogy of the people who work
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
at the US Mint and we don't realize that
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
the we see the money going in front of
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
us so much that we don't realize that
 
05:07:43.990 --> 05:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at millions of dollars we
 
05:07:45.470 --> 05:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
don't realize the value of the thing
 
05:07:48.910 --> 05:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at we look at about a
 
05:07:51.390 --> 05:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
thousand pieces of law that will impact
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
the lives of 1.3 million people every
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
day we look at these laws and we make
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
decisions on I'll speak from my personal
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
experience and dealing with other uh
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives we make them on the most
 
05:08:06.510 --> 05:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and atrocious
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
motives our priorities tend to get out
 
05:08:11.310 --> 05:08:11.320 align:start position:0%
of whack in this place we tend to get
 
05:08:13.150 --> 05:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
out of
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
touch when I hear that we have a loow
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit that has been incredibly
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
successful in helping people own homes
 
05:08:22.708 --> 05:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
and owning homes will solve the housing
 
05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
or help solve the housing crisis the
 
05:08:26.670 --> 05:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
graying of New Hampshire crisis the work
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
crisis all these interwoven crisis that
 
05:08:31.948 --> 05:08:31.958 align:start position:0%
we could do this with this loow hanging
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
fruit that's been working for 40 years
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to because
 
05:08:38.548 --> 05:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
oh I don't really want to give notice
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
and wait a few extra weeks for my deal
 
05:08:40.200 --> 05:08:42.190 align:start position:0%
and wait a few extra weeks for my deal
to

05:08:42.190 --> 05:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:08:44.070 --> 05:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
close I think we need to get our
 
05:08:44.080 --> 05:08:45.910 align:start position:0%
close I think we need to get our
priorities

05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
05:08:47.708 --> 05:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
straight I think we need to get our
 
05:08:48.910 --> 05:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
priorities straight that we think
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
inconveniencing people who are doing
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
quite well in a period of time where
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're making record profits mind you
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
inconveniencing those people is so much
 
05:09:00.628 --> 05:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
more important than solving the fact
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
that people are literally dying in the
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.708 --> 05:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony I'm open for
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative are
 
05:09:17.310 --> 05:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
Reed seeing none oh represent Miner
 
05:09:22.030 --> 05:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:09:24.510 --> 05:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
chairman hi Mrs Reed representative re I
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
was premature I apologize represent
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
that's okay so my question because I
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't see any time here and again this
 
05:09:33.230 --> 05:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
is all new to me I hate to be about
 
05:09:36.430 --> 05:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
things but there's no time limit I am a
 
05:09:38.110 --> 05:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
little bit familiar with how things
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
co-op in the mobile home park it is a
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
little timely um is this is this
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to be exactly the same format
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
as when a mobile home park coops or is
 
05:09:53.110 --> 05:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
this yeah so last year I had OSS copy
 
05:09:56.350 --> 05:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
and paste RSA 205 which is the thing
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
that allowed all these manufactured
 
05:09:59.948 --> 05:09:59.958 align:start position:0%
housing parks to go Co-op these
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
resident-owned communities I said them
 
05:10:04.830 --> 05:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
copy paste and in that that time
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
Judiciary there was a lot of confusion
 
05:10:08.590 --> 05:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
amongst the members because it seemed
 
05:10:10.910 --> 05:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
like I was writing that out of scratch
 
05:10:12.350 --> 05:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
like I had invented that language and
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
the only reason I had that language is
 
05:10:16.030 --> 05:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
because that's what existed so in this
 
05:10:18.590 --> 05:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
version of the bill same exact thing but
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
instead of copy pasting it simply
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
references the RSA so it just says that
 
05:10:26.910 --> 05:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh before final unconditional acceptance
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
which would be the closing um 60 days
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
notice and an opportunity to make an
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
offer in the same manner and according
 
05:10:36.788 --> 05:10:36.798 align:start position:0%
to procedures required of a manufacturer
 
05:10:39.788 --> 05:10:39.798 align:start position:0%
housing Park in RSA 205 except you don't
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
involve New Hampshire manufactured
 
05:10:43.390 --> 05:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
housing Association so it's the same
 
05:10:46.590 --> 05:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
exact to the to the word the same exact
 
05:10:49.350 --> 05:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
process happy to maybe email the
 
05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee 205 so they can look at it but
 
05:10:54.190 --> 05:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
that's basically all it
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
says okay thank you representative for
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony um so moving forward we
 
05:11:00.350 --> 05:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
have a few speakers I'm just going to
 
05:11:01.548 --> 05:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
try to keep it to three minutes so we
 
05:11:03.788 --> 05:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
can finish up hopefully by four o'clock
 
05:11:05.548 --> 05:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll call on Chris
 
05:11:05.558 --> 05:11:12.270 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'll call on Chris
Freeman

05:11:12.270 --> 05:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.750 --> 05:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
oh I'm so I'm sorry representative I
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
forgot you put in a
 
05:11:17.788 --> 05:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
after representative cyber I'll call on
 
05:11:17.798 --> 05:11:21.990 align:start position:0%
after representative cyber I'll call on
you

05:11:21.990 --> 05:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
next no turn it on first thank you hello
 
05:11:27.510 --> 05:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
again um so uh first of all I just want
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge representative Reed's uh
 
05:11:31.390 --> 05:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm for home ownership that's
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
something that um I I feel uh very
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
personally my daytime hat is with a 100%
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
associate owned uh employe emper so I
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
definitely uh feel the the importance of
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
ownership on a very visceral level um I
 
05:11:46.948 --> 05:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
I don't uh particularly agree with the
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
contention that the 60-day notice period
 
05:11:52.750 --> 05:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
is is not onerous and I would also um
 
05:11:55.390 --> 05:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
Express that I have some concerns with
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
the creation of a new law governing
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
multif family um to be incorporated by
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
reference from an existing statute I
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
think that um manufactured home parks
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
are very conducive to conversion to
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
housing cooperatives uh based on the
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
fact that often the individual units are
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
already owned um by the occupants and
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
the portion that's being purchased is
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
the land beneath that um which isn't
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
necessar or is not the case in um in
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
multif family uh within multif family
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
different unit types are going to be
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
more conducive to conversion than other
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
types uh if you have something that was
 
05:12:31.310 --> 05:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
purpose built as multif family where you
 
05:12:34.270 --> 05:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
have submetered units um and you have a
 
05:12:36.548 --> 05:12:36.558 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent mix of unit size and
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
type uh that's pretty straightforward to
 
05:12:41.788 --> 05:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
do a co-op or condominium conversion on
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh but a lot of the housing stock in New
 
05:12:45.070 --> 05:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is pretty old you can have
 
05:12:46.670 --> 05:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
large single families that were chopped
 
05:12:48.910 --> 05:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
up into smaller units um where that
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
process might not be quite a
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh another thing I'd
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
like to point out uh when we're talking
 
05:12:55.470 --> 05:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
about specifically whether this is an
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
onerous proposition or not and the
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
timeline uh considerations are in uh 205
 
05:13:07.590 --> 05:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
a21 uh paragraph 2 uh that States during
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
the notice period required under par
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
paragraph 1 the manufactured housing
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
Park owner shall consider any offer
 
05:13:14.190 --> 05:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
received from the tenants or tenants
 
05:13:16.670 --> 05:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
Association if any and the owner shall
 
05:13:18.510 --> 05:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate in good faith with the tenants
 
05:13:20.510 --> 05:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
concerning a potential purchase if
 
05:13:22.110 --> 05:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
during the notice period the tenants
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
decide to make an offer to purchase the
 
05:13:25.948 --> 05:13:25.958 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park such offer
 
05:13:27.510 --> 05:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
shall be evidenced by a purchase and
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
sale agreement however the tenants shall
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable time beyond the 60-day
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
notice period if necessary to obtain
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
financing for the purchase and so one of
 
05:13:38.030 --> 05:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the questions I would have is whether
 
05:13:39.788 --> 05:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
good faith negotiation means
 
05:13:41.548 --> 05:13:41.558 align:start position:0%
compromising your timeline which could
 
05:13:43.390 --> 05:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
very well be impacted by other
 
05:13:45.910 --> 05:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
considerations like doing a 1031
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
exchange um or engaging in a portfolio
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
sale I think that that provision could
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
be problematic and and it creates
 
05:13:56.430 --> 05:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
ambiguity around what constitutes good
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
faith and then and then just one one
 
05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
last point if I could um it is I believe
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the data on this but I
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
believe that it is more common in multif
 
05:14:09.628 --> 05:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
family portfolios for there to be other
 
05:14:10.868 --> 05:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh factors that could impact the
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
feasibility of executing a co-op
 
05:14:14.190 --> 05:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
conversion one of which is that
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
portfolio sales are more common than in
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh mobile home parks uh it's not that
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
uncommon to bundle 20 properties and
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
sell them off if you're a larger
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
landlord and that's the efficient way
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
for you to do it and there are also
 
05:14:28.110 --> 05:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
situations where if you are a larger
 
05:14:29.830 --> 05:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
landlord with these commercial multif
 
05:14:32.350 --> 05:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
Family Properties you don't necessarily
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
have in your commercial lending
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
covenants the ability to get a partial
 
05:14:37.708 --> 05:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
release uh and sell off units
 
05:14:40.110 --> 05:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
individually so it also raises the
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
question of would the um tenants be
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
obligated to purchase the entire
 
05:14:46.030 --> 05:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio from the landlord or could
 
05:14:48.548 --> 05:14:48.558 align:start position:0%
they go forward with an efficient sale
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
05:14:54.548 --> 05:14:54.558 align:start position:0%

05:15:21.190 --> 05:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is W one in
 
05:15:24.510 --> 05:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um so I'm here today
 
05:15:26.590 --> 05:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
because this has become a really
 
05:15:29.230 --> 05:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
important issue to a lot of folks I've
 
05:15:32.548 --> 05:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
come across um one person in particular
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
this past summer um had an issue she
 
05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
heard about me through a friend um who
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
knew I did a lot of you know I was just
 
05:15:42.470 --> 05:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
kind of dabbling around in in housing
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
related issues and apparently it so I
 
05:15:48.110 --> 05:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
end up talking with a teacher from
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
Auburn who lives in Manchester and her
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
building was sold all of a sudden so on
 
05:15:57.788 --> 05:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
one Saturday just very randomly the new
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
owner came up and told her that her rent
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
was changing as of 30 days she had her
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
rent was doubling and then on top of
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
that Within in 30 days they wanted to
 
05:16:13.948 --> 05:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
put in a new down payment or that's what
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted from her a new updated down
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
payment because of the change of
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
ownership and that would be based on
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
also that new rent cost so she's like
 
05:16:28.350 --> 05:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
how do I pay for this she's like is this
 
05:16:31.030 --> 05:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
even legal like is this why is it okay
 
05:16:33.910 --> 05:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
for them to do this and I really didn't
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
have an answer for her you know
 
05:16:37.708 --> 05:16:37.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's kind of like
 
05:16:40.350 --> 05:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
Moonlight at a strip Club is like my
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
only option to tell her um cuz how do
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
you make money that fast that much money
 
05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
people don't always have thousands of
 
05:16:49.430 --> 05:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollars laying around even if you own a
 
05:16:53.150 --> 05:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
home you know um and I just like to add
 
05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
that within the past you know a couple
 
05:16:58.110 --> 05:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
of years there's been a lot of instances
 
05:17:00.270 --> 05:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
where people move out of the state
 
05:17:02.670 --> 05:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
because they cannot find housing a lot
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
of them are young couples they had been
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
saving up they're looking for their
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
American dream and people were watch
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
walking into these open houses and they
 
05:17:14.590 --> 05:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
were essentially you know walking in
 
05:17:18.030 --> 05:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
with $100,000 cash left and right and
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
literally there were no homes left and
 
05:17:23.670 --> 05:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
so I just want to say that people are
 
05:17:26.350 --> 05:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
just going to move away and the fact
 
05:17:29.110 --> 05:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
that we're charging double what an
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
average mortgage cost and rent for one
 
05:17:35.390 --> 05:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
person in a multif family home is
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
completely nuts to me and they're also
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
expected it see seems to take care of a
 
05:17:41.948 --> 05:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
lot of the maintenance essentially do
 
05:17:44.750 --> 05:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
all of the upkeep for the home as if
 
05:17:47.310 --> 05:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
they were an owner without being having
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually be one so thank
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
you I'll take any questions thank you
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
any any questions for
 
05:17:58.830 --> 05:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
05:18:14.270 --> 05:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:16.350 --> 05:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
thank you once
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
again I would so my name is Nick Norman
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
I would start by saying I would ech Echo
 
05:18:25.390 --> 05:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
the things that Chris Freeman said and
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
quite well so I'm not sure that I could
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
add much better description of a lot of
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
that than what he has already said Real
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
Estate is can is very the real estate
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
world industry is very large and complex
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
particularly when you're talking about
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
different kinds of multif family and
 
05:18:50.030 --> 05:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
rental homes it's it's U such a bigger
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
piece to just say
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
every sale of every kind of real estate
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
would have to go through the 60-day
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
notice period I do believe would be very
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
owners and it would impede sales um you
 
05:19:08.830 --> 05:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
know I can't say I know that process of
 
05:19:13.270 --> 05:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
mobile home conversion but just the the
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
fact that the market is
 
05:19:18.990 --> 05:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
fast and sometimes a housing provider
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
might need to sell quickly and then if
 
05:19:24.788 --> 05:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
you've got uh the the ability and
 
05:19:27.070 --> 05:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
requirement actually not the ability to
 
05:19:30.670 --> 05:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
have this 60 day notice that could
 
05:19:32.670 --> 05:19:32.680 align:start position:0%
impede the sale suppose you've got a
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
sale under agreement that this buyer are
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
they going to are they going to now walk
 
05:19:40.190 --> 05:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
away because someone else could
 
05:19:42.470 --> 05:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
effectively compete and beat them out of
 
05:19:42.480 --> 05:19:43.590 align:start position:0%
effectively compete and beat them out of
that

05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:47.270 --> 05:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
sale just doesn't make sense to me is it
 
05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
is it really that possible for tenants
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
of a multif family property to pull
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
together and
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
buy you know this
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
large this multif family and there's
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's no scope on limit on this you
 
05:20:08.230 --> 05:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
know development of a thousand units
 
05:20:11.230 --> 05:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
goes through the same process the the
 
05:20:14.750 --> 05:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
pro the uh possibility of talking about
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
the portfolio sales that stuff happens I
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine what a nightmare that
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
would be in trying to portfolio sell
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
your properties and having this in the
 
05:20:25.788 --> 05:20:25.798 align:start position:0%
middle of
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
it uh it seems to me it could also
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes have a negative effect to the
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
existing tenants if you've got tenants
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
that are financially disadvantaged
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
because that's that's you know who they
 
05:20:41.788 --> 05:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
are they're renting because they're in
 
05:20:44.430 --> 05:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
that position and you've got a group of
 
05:20:46.590 --> 05:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
tenants trying to buy the building it
 
05:20:49.070 --> 05:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
seems to me that could logically end up
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
with the people that can't afford it
 
05:20:51.000 --> 05:20:52.190 align:start position:0%
with the people that can't afford it
being

05:20:52.190 --> 05:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:20:54.430 --> 05:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
displaced because they can't keep up
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
with whatever is in required in terms of
 
05:20:59.948 --> 05:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
their proetta share of costs maintenance
 
05:21:02.830 --> 05:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
and whatever it would take to to pull
 
05:21:05.310 --> 05:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
the sale uh to
 
05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
happen there's also some ambiguity in in
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
the the way it's written 60-day notice
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
from what I know representative Reed
 
05:21:15.948 --> 05:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
said from closing but it doesn't say
 
05:21:17.628 --> 05:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
that Mr Norman if you could wrap up for
 
05:21:19.788 --> 05:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
us that'd be great so uh I just think
 
05:21:21.548 --> 05:21:21.558 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complications with it
 
05:21:23.628 --> 05:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
and it
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
would tie up investors hands we need to
 
05:21:30.190 --> 05:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
have people invest and create more
 
05:21:32.868 --> 05:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
housing more than tie up their hands I'd
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions thank you Mr
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
Norman questions representative Gibbs
 
05:21:41.868 --> 05:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr Norman you mentioned
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
that uh tenants who have housing Choice
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
vouchers otherwise known as Section 8
 
05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
could not participate in a purchase um
 
05:21:52.670 --> 05:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there are types of
 
05:21:55.230 --> 05:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
Section 8 vouchers that allow for
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
purchase of a home so I don't know all
 
05:22:00.910 --> 05:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
the intricacies of Section 8 I do know
 
05:22:05.230 --> 05:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
that the program for Section 8 or let's
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
say subsidized housing is very large
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's a Section 8 there's another
 
05:22:11.230 --> 05:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
there's another kind of section there's
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
a section two and there's a section
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
something else I don't know all of those
 
05:22:18.470 --> 05:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
options um what I'm referring to there
 
05:22:18.480 --> 05:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
options um what I'm referring to there
is

05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:22:22.750 --> 05:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
basically someone that doesn't have
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
strong financial means is very unlikely
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
05:22:26.280 --> 05:22:30.868 align:start position:0%
to be able
to

05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
purchase all right seeing nothing thank
 
05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
you and the last speaker on this is
 
05:22:43.270 --> 05:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
being last and knowing everybody wants
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
to go I'll try and be as brief as
 
05:22:48.510 --> 05:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
possible thank you uh my name is David
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
Klein I just want to start off with
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
something representative Reed said
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
that's not true a fourplex is restricted
 
05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
property unless its owned or occupied
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's an RSA 540
 
05:23:03.190 --> 05:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
A1A um and one of the things that I feel
 
05:23:05.230 --> 05:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
about this bill the feasibility of it is
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
problematic because you have a a real
 
05:23:10.990 --> 05:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
contrast between mobile home owners who
 
05:23:12.910 --> 05:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
are in a park than trying to buy a park
 
05:23:14.430 --> 05:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
you're starting off with people who own
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
their mobile home they have credit or
 
05:23:17.470 --> 05:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have been able to get a
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
mortgage they've dealt with mortgage
 
05:23:21.190 --> 05:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
payments they have to maintain the
 
05:23:23.310 --> 05:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
interior and exterior of their mobile
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
home as well as the grounds and these
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
are people have a layer of
 
05:23:28.868 --> 05:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
sophistication that some tenants will
 
05:23:31.628 --> 05:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
have and some tenants will not have
 
05:23:34.670 --> 05:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
versus in in a multif family building we
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
we run the gamut we have one building
 
05:23:39.150 --> 05:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
where we have people that
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
third floor they both work for the
 
05:23:43.310 --> 05:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
passport center in Portsmouth and
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
they're hourly workers and then we have
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
another tenant who she has her father
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
who's retired and a teenager she works
 
05:23:53.708 --> 05:23:53.718 align:start position:0%
retail she has enough money to pay a
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
rent but there's no way she's going to
 
05:23:57.230 --> 05:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
have to be no way she'll be able to
 
05:23:59.708 --> 05:23:59.718 align:start position:0%
float the cost of the mortgage on top of
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
all of the maintenance expenses of the
 
05:24:03.548 --> 05:24:03.558 align:start position:0%
building as a result we're going to have
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these we're going to have to
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
offer if we want to sell it the 60 days
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
go through all of the delays and the
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
financing issue is as been reported
 
05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
before in the in 205a it's reasonable
 
05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
time there's no definition and that's
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
unclear what a reasonable time will be
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
and I think we're going to have a lot of
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
these where are just going to sit there
 
05:24:26.750 --> 05:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
buildings won't be able to be sold new
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
developers are going to look at it and
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
say hey if I develop a building and go
 
05:24:31.628 --> 05:24:31.638 align:start position:0%
to sell it how long is it going to take
 
05:24:33.990 --> 05:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
me to be able to sell it we want to
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
encourage Builders to come into the
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
state build more Apartments I mean you
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
heard the uh testimony of earlier where
 
05:24:43.990 --> 05:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
were only building there was like 4,000
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
housing permits put out last year that's
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculous given our needs let's not put
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
in something that would be a deterrent
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
to people building and making it more
 
05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
complicated to sell the properties after
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
you build them which is where really we
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
lie the profit is for the
 
05:25:02.990 --> 05:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
builders thank you for your testimony
 
05:25:05.190 --> 05:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr Klein representative
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh what it alter your
 
05:25:12.470 --> 05:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
position on this bill if it were amended
 
05:25:15.708 --> 05:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
to provide a specified period of time
 
05:25:17.310 --> 05:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
that would be a reasonable amount of
 
05:25:20.350 --> 05:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
time to obtain financing no I don't
 
05:25:22.270 --> 05:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
think so I I still feel that you're
 
05:25:25.390 --> 05:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
tying it up you're going to need 60 days
 
05:25:28.830 --> 05:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
right off the bat according to the 205a
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
to even negotiate a purchase and sale
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
agreement then it's going to be at least
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
another 60 days to obtain financing and
 
05:25:36.110 --> 05:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
then the title search and the other
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
closing times so it's still going to be
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
delay in my mind of five to six months
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
at a
 
05:25:43.628 --> 05:25:43.638 align:start position:0%
minimum all right any other
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions um representative
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
kwin thank you um I I just might have
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
misheard you but did you um say that
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
having multiple um offers might uh there
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
be a risk of not being able to sell um
 
05:26:02.350 --> 05:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't the opposite happen then
 
05:26:03.750 --> 05:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
that multiple offers would actually
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
drive up the price I might have
 
05:26:07.070 --> 05:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
misunderstood I had I said nothing about
 
05:26:09.150 --> 05:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
multiple offers okay in my testimony at
 
05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
all sorry thanks uh representative
 
05:26:16.830 --> 05:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
Paige thank you uh Mr chairman I'm I'm
 
05:26:19.390 --> 05:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
trying to tease out the distinction that
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
we're drawing
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
between folks living in a manufactured
 
05:26:26.190 --> 05:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
home and renters in a multif family
 
05:26:30.708 --> 05:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
Union uh multif family building and I'm
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just not
 
05:26:35.510 --> 05:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
understanding what's qualitatively
 
05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
different about these two types of
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
individuals you know we have the
 
05:26:40.350 --> 05:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
successful model with manufactured
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
housing I hear you talking about one
 
05:26:44.190 --> 05:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
tenant who's working
 
05:26:46.590 --> 05:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
retail but you know I've had tenants
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
working retail who rent from me and then
 
05:26:51.990 --> 05:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
move on to buy a manufactured home um so
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
qualitatively what's the difference
 
05:26:59.548 --> 05:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
between these two classes of people of
 
05:27:02.310 --> 05:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
what I said is the tenants are very
 
05:27:04.590 --> 05:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
diverse and in their knowledge their
 
05:27:07.548 --> 05:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
financial background their abilities to
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
handle maintenance issues things of that
 
05:27:12.070 --> 05:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
nature some of the tenants as you said
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
the your retail people people worked in
 
05:27:18.070 --> 05:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
retail put aside money obviously
 
05:27:21.230 --> 05:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
developed a down payment had good credit
 
05:27:23.470 --> 05:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
we have tenants that can do that we have
 
05:27:25.230 --> 05:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
tenants that have terrible credit they
 
05:27:26.910 --> 05:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
can't handle a dime if they didn't live
 
05:27:29.310 --> 05:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
on cash paycheck to paycheck that's
 
05:27:31.708 --> 05:27:31.718 align:start position:0%
that's the way they get by and actually
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
at one point we're renting weekly during
 
05:27:35.190 --> 05:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
the big uh recession because that was
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
the only way we'd get paid so the all
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is that you got such a
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
diversity there's going to be a chunk of
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
those tenants can I quantify it no that
 
05:27:45.628 --> 05:27:45.638 align:start position:0%
will not be able to buy in they don't
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
have the resources or uh the
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
sophistication that's what I was trying
 
05:27:53.788 --> 05:27:53.798 align:start position:0%
to say as and I also want to point out
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
something I forgot is don't forget a lot
 
05:27:57.430 --> 05:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
of these multifamilies are mixed use
 
05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
buildings how do you address the retail
 
05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
or the other type of use the commercial
 
05:28:04.548 --> 05:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
use on the first floor you don't have
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
that in mobile home parks you do that
 
05:28:08.548 --> 05:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
have that in many of the down downtown
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
locations and in fact most towns in the
 
05:28:14.070 --> 05:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
downtown areas are now requiring it by
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
zoning any new buildings have to be
 
05:28:17.948 --> 05:28:17.958 align:start position:0%
commercial on the first floor what do
 
05:28:19.548 --> 05:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
you do with these retail
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
tenants and that's not addressed because
 
05:28:26.310 --> 05:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
thing okay any other questions see none
 
05:28:30.830 --> 05:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Klein is anyone else here
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
to testify on HB
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
444 okay seeing none I'm going to close
 
05:28:39.350 --> 05:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
the public hearing at 327 and hand the
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
chair okay we'll open the public hearing
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
on Bill number 399 and recognize
 
05:29:08.110 --> 05:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander well thank you
 
05:29:09.750 --> 05:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the housing
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Joe
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
Alexander I represent the town of gtown
 
05:29:16.270 --> 05:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'm serving my fourth term um which is
 
05:29:20.110 --> 05:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District um 29 um I mainly put
 
05:29:21.430 --> 05:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
this in and and this is one of the great
 
05:29:24.030 --> 05:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
bills that has um believe it or not you
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
know leadership on the Republican and
 
05:29:27.788 --> 05:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
Democratic side the leaders are both
 
05:29:30.070 --> 05:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
supporting um as well as bipartisan
 
05:29:32.070 --> 05:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
support in the Senate and what this
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
mainly would do and you'll see with the
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
legislative intent that I wrote um it
 
05:29:37.390 --> 05:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
would basically establish a commission
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
to study the historical evolution of the
 
05:29:41.788 --> 05:29:41.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire zoning enabling act so
 
05:29:43.548 --> 05:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
coincidentally and I did not clain this
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
but I was really excited to hear that um
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's turning 100 this year so what
 
05:29:49.548 --> 05:29:49.558 align:start position:0%
better thing to do than to study
 
05:29:51.788 --> 05:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
something that's turned 100 years old um
 
05:29:54.390 --> 05:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would do was establish
 
05:29:56.868 --> 05:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
a commission um a bipartisan commission
 
05:29:58.750 --> 05:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
it would include housing experts it it
 
05:30:02.190 --> 05:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
would include members of both parties um
 
05:30:04.190 --> 05:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature I believe member of the
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
public um to really study um the
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions that I outlined
 
05:30:11.548 --> 05:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
in the commission so that is on that's
 
05:30:13.788 --> 05:30:13.798 align:start position:0%
going to start on line 25 of the bill is
 
05:30:15.788 --> 05:30:15.798 align:start position:0%
going to be the questions that um we
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
would study and the purpose of it is
 
05:30:19.868 --> 05:30:19.878 align:start position:0%
basically to study how it has evolved
 
05:30:22.868 --> 05:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
over the years so um you know how the
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
courts have weighed in on zoning how um
 
05:30:28.670 --> 05:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
the powers have been construed um it
 
05:30:32.110 --> 05:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
would basically examine RSA 674 which is
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
how the state has enabled local zoning
 
05:30:37.150 --> 05:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
so um with that I have a lot of people
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
here experts that are willing to speak
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
in favor of the bill so um I hope you'll
 
05:30:42.750 --> 05:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
defer questions to them but I think this
 
05:30:45.628 --> 05:30:45.638 align:start position:0%
is a um something the legislature um
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
because we give powers to towns I think
 
05:30:49.110 --> 05:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's something that we absolutely have
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
to study occasionally and I think 100
 
05:30:53.548 --> 05:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
years is a great time to do it so with
 
05:30:55.750 --> 05:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm gonna end my testimony thank
 
05:30:57.788 --> 05:30:57.798 align:start position:0%
you one I'm sorry one other thing Mr
 
05:31:01.350 --> 05:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair if I could um like unlike most
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
commissions this one is going to sunset
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of this term so it that's
 
05:31:09.190 --> 05:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
online um 29 on page two so rest assured
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be one of those
 
05:31:12.750 --> 05:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
commissions that will be alive through
 
05:31:15.990 --> 05:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the recesses of the rest of time so
 
05:31:17.350 --> 05:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
this this will go away at the end of
 
05:31:17.360 --> 05:31:18.750 align:start position:0%
this this will go away at the end of
this

05:31:18.750 --> 05:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
term thank you there any
 
05:31:23.948 --> 05:31:23.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:31:26.190 --> 05:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
you keeping the spirit of moving things
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
along we'll keep the public testimony to
 
05:31:35.948 --> 05:31:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
Moore morning Mr chairman of the
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee thanks for the opportunity to
 
05:31:40.708 --> 05:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
speak here today for the record my name
 
05:31:41.948 --> 05:31:41.958 align:start position:0%
is Greg Moore I'm a regional director
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
with Americans for Prosperity here today
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of House Bill
 
05:31:49.548 --> 05:31:49.558 align:start position:0%
399 last year when I was before the
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
special committee on housing and I'm
 
05:31:53.230 --> 05:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
sorry that you guys aren't special
 
05:31:56.310 --> 05:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
anymore you're special to me uh but but
 
05:31:58.310 --> 05:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
this I said as we were going through a
 
05:31:59.788 --> 05:31:59.798 align:start position:0%
number of the changes that addressed
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
local zoning and planning I said we can
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
continue this process of playing wacka
 
05:32:06.548 --> 05:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
or we can try to basically open up and
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
look at the entirety of how we handle
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
local zoning and planning this
 
05:32:14.670 --> 05:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately is is I think if the the
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
process that this creates is possibly
 
05:32:18.430 --> 05:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
the most important thing that I think
 
05:32:20.670 --> 05:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
this committee will do over the Arc of
 
05:32:22.708 --> 05:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
over the Arc of the the next two years
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
if we get this right then I think we can
 
05:32:25.510 --> 05:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
fix a lot of our problems I know the
 
05:32:27.868 --> 05:32:27.878 align:start position:0%
governor A's working on the agency side
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
the executive brand stuff she's trying
 
05:32:30.548 --> 05:32:30.558 align:start position:0%
to do what she can on with the
 
05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
permitting and things like that and uh
 
05:32:34.708 --> 05:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
was at a forum last Thursday to hear
 
05:32:37.070 --> 05:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
about quite quite a few of those but
 
05:32:39.470 --> 05:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately this this legislation House
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 399 uh looks at the root cause
 
05:32:44.350 --> 05:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
starts getting into the root cause
 
05:32:46.030 --> 05:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
analysis and tries to figure out how can
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
we look at the amount of amount that
 
05:32:50.948 --> 05:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
we've been Authority we've granted to
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
local governments and assume and
 
05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
determine if uh they have overs their
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
boundaries or whether or whether it's in
 
05:32:58.430 --> 05:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
the right spot or how it could be
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
adjusted and adapted after 100 years I
 
05:33:02.310 --> 05:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
think the people on the commission are
 
05:33:04.990 --> 05:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
good I think the idea of having uh
 
05:33:06.788 --> 05:33:06.798 align:start position:0%
National experts is critical for people
 
05:33:08.110 --> 05:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
who can take a look outside of New
 
05:33:10.150 --> 05:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire look at what's going on in
 
05:33:11.628 --> 05:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
other states and what they're doing what
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
the challenges that they're facing so
 
05:33:15.390 --> 05:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
bringing people to the table who who
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
come from outside of New Hampshire or or
 
05:33:19.470 --> 05:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
at least are National experts I think is
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
adds a real value I think adding the
 
05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in here is critical because
 
05:33:27.070 --> 05:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary is uh at least as culpable
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
as a legislature of getting us to some
 
05:33:30.788 --> 05:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
of the mess we're in now so having them
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table that we believe
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
is critical and we believe uh to having
 
05:33:38.030 --> 05:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
the public uh because it is number one
 
05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
issue facing uh the public in New
 
05:33:41.868 --> 05:33:41.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is the issue lack of lack
 
05:33:44.110 --> 05:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
of housing affordable or otherwise we
 
05:33:46.708 --> 05:33:46.718 align:start position:0%
just have a lack of Housing and so uh
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
having someone who can bring that uh
 
05:33:51.708 --> 05:33:51.718 align:start position:0%
experience and bring that the idea of
 
05:33:53.510 --> 05:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
the impact that it's having from the
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
public is is the right right method and
 
05:33:58.150 --> 05:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
so we think that the people involved the
 
05:34:00.990 --> 05:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
scope is correct and so we we're pretty
 
05:34:02.830 --> 05:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
supportive of uh the chairman for for
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
bringing this legislation um I could say
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
that I said to do it last year and he
 
05:34:08.590 --> 05:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
listened to me so going to take a little
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
a little credit here no I'm joking I
 
05:34:12.110 --> 05:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
know he knows I know that he knows that
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is a problem that needs to be
 
05:34:15.070 --> 05:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
addressed so with that I'd be happy to
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you are there
 
05:34:17.040 --> 05:34:18.070 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you are there
any

05:34:18.070 --> 05:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:34:21.510 --> 05:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr Moore
 
05:34:25.548 --> 05:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.310 --> 05:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
stand sorry have to leave oh he's not
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.350 --> 05:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
Klein thank you Mr chairman members of
 
05:34:39.868 --> 05:34:39.878 align:start position:0%
the committee at Drew Klein the
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
president of the ji bord Center for
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
Public Policy uh unlike my friend Greg
 
05:34:44.430 --> 05:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
Moore I know that it's afternoon and not
 
05:34:47.430 --> 05:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
morning so good afternoon to you guys we
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
um have studied this issue extensively
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
if any of you haven't seen it I will try
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
to deliver it to you um but you can
 
05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
Google Josiah Bartlett Center housing
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
study 2021 we looked at land use
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
regulations in New Hampshire going back
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh for decades to try to get a sense of
 
05:35:06.230 --> 05:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
what was the problem why did we have
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
this housting shortage and you know our
 
05:35:11.390 --> 05:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
study did conclude that the land use
 
05:35:12.990 --> 05:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
regulations at the local level are the
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
the primary cause of New Hampshire's
 
05:35:16.628 --> 05:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
housing shortage one of the things that
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
we did in our historical look back which
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
did not go back um a century in depth in
 
05:35:25.230 --> 05:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was um that evolution of
 
05:35:29.070 --> 05:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
how stated principles and reasons for
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
land use regulations are not necessarily
 
05:35:34.270 --> 05:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
the current reasons why Lan use
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
regulations are being used and they do
 
05:35:38.830 --> 05:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
change over time so a look back like
 
05:35:42.110 --> 05:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
this I think is really important for New
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh century mark is a great
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
time to do it you'll find I think based
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
on what we've done in New Hampshire but
 
05:35:50.590 --> 05:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
also looked at in other states you will
 
05:35:53.548 --> 05:35:53.558 align:start position:0%
find massive um Mission creep in these
 
05:35:56.030 --> 05:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
regulations you'll find possibly that
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
um that regulations aren't matched up to
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do so for
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
example in RSA 67417 I believe uh one of
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
the stated reason for zoning is to
 
05:36:11.150 --> 05:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
justifications for zoning is to reduce
 
05:36:14.190 --> 05:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
traffic congestion well we're pretty
 
05:36:15.910 --> 05:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
well established that zoning increases
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
traffic congestion so you're going to
 
05:36:21.990 --> 05:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
find a lot of problems um and a lot of
 
05:36:23.990 --> 05:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh change over time and some of the
 
05:36:26.190 --> 05:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
stuff you've you've talked about today
 
05:36:28.430 --> 05:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
um but I agree with Greg's
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation that of all the things
 
05:36:32.510 --> 05:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
this committee does this year this is
 
05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
probably the most consequential and most
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
important because until now the
 
05:36:40.628 --> 05:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
legislature has tried to take these
 
05:36:44.110 --> 05:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
issues on discreetly one at a time and
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
how that has worked out so taking this
 
05:36:53.070 --> 05:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
approach a holistic approach I think and
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
getting to the root of the issue is
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
really going to serve New Hampshire very
 
05:37:00.910 --> 05:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
very well and it'll give at the very
 
05:37:04.548 --> 05:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
least everybody in New Hampshire a real
 
05:37:07.350 --> 05:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
sense of how we got to where we are and
 
05:37:08.990 --> 05:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
if if we want to keep going in that
 
05:37:11.868 --> 05:37:11.878 align:start position:0%
direction and I think the stated mission
 
05:37:16.030 --> 05:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
of this um commission is is really good
 
05:37:17.150 --> 05:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
the list of things you're going to look
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
at is just the kind of things that you
 
05:37:22.110 --> 05:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
want to identify so we think this is a
 
05:37:24.590 --> 05:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
great effort and just to give you you
 
05:37:27.030 --> 05:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
know an example with um one of you guys
 
05:37:28.868 --> 05:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
was mentioning some of the housing data
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
so every time I mention the statistic um
 
05:37:33.628 --> 05:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of people find it
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
surprising so if you look back 50 years
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
to 1970
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
3 um the building permit data the most
 
05:37:42.750 --> 05:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
recent that we have that the states
 
05:37:45.310 --> 05:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
publish is from 2023 so if you look back
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
50 years in
 
05:37:51.430 --> 05:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
1973 uh developers were allowed to pull
 
05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
or to they were given approved 7,700
 
05:37:56.830 --> 05:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
building permits in that year for
 
05:37:59.070 --> 05:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
residentials that's both single family
 
05:38:02.990 --> 05:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
and multif family in 2023 it was 4500
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
total in
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
1973 we had fewer than 00,000 people in
 
05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think as memory serves
 
05:38:13.350 --> 05:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
it was about 790,000 people so we have
 
05:38:15.990 --> 05:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
1.4 million people
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
today and we're building a fraction of
 
05:38:21.948 --> 05:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
the homes and demand for homes is much
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
higher and 1973 was the beginning of the
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
Arab Oil Embargo recession
 
05:38:30.190 --> 05:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the situation we're in right
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
now and our work at J Bartlet Center has
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
identified those local land use
 
05:38:37.030 --> 05:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
regulations as the primary cause of that
 
05:38:38.430 --> 05:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
reduction and building permits and
 
05:38:41.468 --> 05:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
building in general so taking a
 
05:38:43.948 --> 05:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look at it is absolutely
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it and it'll cut
 
05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
through a lot of the problems that you
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
guys have been seeing and the
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
legislature has been seeing trying to
 
05:38:53.150 --> 05:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
tackle this one little discreet
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
regulation at a time that's all thank
 
05:38:58.510 --> 05:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
you there are any questions
 
05:39:02.110 --> 05:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you and hello
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
Mr C hello representative as you know um
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
I don't frequently agree with Josiah
 
05:39:11.910 --> 05:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
Bartlet Center on a lot but um I think
 
05:39:14.110 --> 05:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
you might appreciate my question sure
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
which is that is it your opinion that
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
the state of zoning that we find
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves in today as you were talking
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
about Mission creep has far exceeded
 
05:39:28.030 --> 05:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
both the uclid V Ambler Supreme Court
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
decision in 1926 as well as the
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
analogous New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:39:35.070 --> 05:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
decision both of which had determined
 
05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
that zoning ordinances really are only
 
05:39:39.548 --> 05:39:39.558 align:start position:0%
leg legate in that they are for health
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
and safety and not for arbitrary
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
aesthetic purposes yeah well so I thank
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative Reed
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the things that I
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
Delight in when the Bartlet Center uh
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
can find agreement with uh folks from
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
all different perspectives and points of
 
05:39:56.070 --> 05:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
view you certainly see in the ENA
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
Statute in New Hampshire that it enables
 
05:40:00.868 --> 05:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
Zoning for health safety and uh the
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
general welfare and as we all know from
 
05:40:03.990 --> 05:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution that phrase is
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
problematic it opens up a big hole for
 
05:40:10.948 --> 05:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
very broad uh use of these statutes and
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
what we have seen over the decades is a
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
massive Mission cre is M municipalities
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting away from health and safety and
 
05:40:21.150 --> 05:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
as I talked about before in the previous
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
Bill those externalities right so you're
 
05:40:25.468 --> 05:40:25.478 align:start position:0%
really supposed to just be looking at
 
05:40:27.628 --> 05:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
harm caused by a building or a
 
05:40:31.270 --> 05:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
development but we have statues or
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
ordinances that go down to paint colors
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
and you know various aesthetic purposes
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
they get really really detailed and it
 
05:40:41.190 --> 05:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
gets really silly and that's a far
 
05:40:44.110 --> 05:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
stretch from the original idea of health
 
05:40:46.230 --> 05:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
and safety now you could there's a lot
 
05:40:48.910 --> 05:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
of research online about the actual or
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
origins of zoning in San Francisco and
 
05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
New York and we could get into a whole L
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
conversation about that um but I think
 
05:40:57.868 --> 05:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
you can certainly look at the last
 
05:41:00.510 --> 05:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
couple of decades and see that the
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
zoning has strayed from its what it
 
05:41:04.990 --> 05:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
should have been in New Hampshire was
 
05:41:06.670 --> 05:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
very narrowly tailored to health and
 
05:41:06.680 --> 05:41:10.510 align:start position:0%
very narrowly tailored to health and
safety

05:41:10.510 --> 05:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:11.788 --> 05:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
Holland good afternoon Sarah Holland New
 
05:41:30.590 --> 05:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors um we
 
05:41:33.468 --> 05:41:33.478 align:start position:0%
Echo um the support stated previously um
 
05:41:35.230 --> 05:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's housing challenges
 
05:41:37.868 --> 05:41:37.878 align:start position:0%
require thoughtful data driven Solutions
 
05:41:39.990 --> 05:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill offers an important step
 
05:41:41.548 --> 05:41:41.558 align:start position:0%
towards ensuring that our zoning laws
 
05:41:43.468 --> 05:41:43.478 align:start position:0%
support growth affordability and
 
05:41:43.478 --> 05:41:44.670 align:start position:0%
support growth affordability and
Community

05:41:44.670 --> 05:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
Community
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
stabilization um for these reasons I
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to support the
 
05:41:49.830 --> 05:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and Advance the formation of
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
the study commission and the New
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Realtors would welcome an
 
05:41:55.270 --> 05:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be a part of this further
 
05:41:57.390 --> 05:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
discussion and provide resources as may
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
be appropriate thank you uh short and
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
sweet any questions representative Reed
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:42:08.190 --> 05:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm happy that we are
 
05:42:14.350 --> 05:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
on the same side on this one um so being
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that you have some
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
information being with the Realtors on
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
this particular issue because we just I
 
05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
just brought up about the health and
 
05:42:25.070 --> 05:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
safety aspect and how this was what was
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
what made zoning legitimate according to
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
a scotus decision and a New Hampshire
 
05:42:31.868 --> 05:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision are you aware of
 
05:42:34.270 --> 05:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
the practice of redlining that began
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
around that time and made um made those
 
05:42:42.110 --> 05:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
decisions kind of necessary um and do
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
you think that potentially the uh
 
05:42:46.750 --> 05:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
Mission creep we've seen or the moving
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
of the goalpost that we've seen might be
 
05:42:51.548 --> 05:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
kind of get its roots and origin in that
 
05:42:54.430 --> 05:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
practice Yeah so red Linings Origins
 
05:42:58.868 --> 05:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
were in the the financial lending aspect
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and and yes absolutely we still see
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
it today in a number of communities both
 
05:43:07.468 --> 05:43:07.478 align:start position:0%
inside and outside of the state um and
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
all of this falls into zoning and and
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
the power that is given from the state
 
05:43:15.310 --> 05:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities to be able to
 
05:43:17.628 --> 05:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
manage their own communities so I do
 
05:43:20.548 --> 05:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
think that with a 100-year anniversary
 
05:43:24.868 --> 05:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:26.910 --> 05:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
revisit any other
 
05:43:29.390 --> 05:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss Holland is
 
05:43:30.430 --> 05:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
there anybody else that would like to
 
05:43:31.868 --> 05:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
05:43:35.110 --> 05:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
Bill yes you fill out a pink card after
 
05:43:38.830 --> 05:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
you're done thank you
 
05:43:39.910 --> 05:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just Echo what I think
 
05:43:41.548 --> 05:43:41.558 align:start position:0%
somebody else said which is that uh
 
05:43:43.230 --> 05:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
revisiting zoning I think is probably
 
05:43:45.070 --> 05:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we've discussed
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
today that is ultimately going to matter
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we can get into the the ins
 
05:43:51.548 --> 05:43:51.558 align:start position:0%
and outs of landlord tenant law but at
 
05:43:53.310 --> 05:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we fundamentally have
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
an issue with supply and demand and you
 
05:43:59.350 --> 05:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
can trace that directly back to um the
 
05:44:01.070 --> 05:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
the land use regulations that we have
 
05:44:03.590 --> 05:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um if you look at
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
the report that's compiled by the KO
 
05:44:07.868 --> 05:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
Institute I believe uh as of the most
 
05:44:09.948 --> 05:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
recent report New Hampshire ranks 37th
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
out of 50 for the ease of navigating our
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
land use restrictions um the other hat
 
05:44:16.350 --> 05:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
that I wear I I'm an aspiring developer
 
05:44:17.910 --> 05:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move Beyond just buying the
 
05:44:19.548 --> 05:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
stuff that already exists to actually
 
05:44:22.468 --> 05:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
building new stuff uh or or converting
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh underperforming or underutilized off
 
05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
office space uh into new residential and
 
05:44:29.990 --> 05:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
what we found uh for the past several
 
05:44:32.270 --> 05:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
years is that's a very difficult space
 
05:44:34.468 --> 05:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
to break into and a big portion of that
 
05:44:36.190 --> 05:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
is because there's so much uncertainty
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from the zoning and land use
 
05:44:40.150 --> 05:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
regulations as somebody else mentioned
 
05:44:42.270 --> 05:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
um they can be extremely prescriptive in
 
05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
Keen we we updated it to modernize it
 
05:44:47.230 --> 05:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
and uh some of those modernizations
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
included specifying the visible light
 
05:44:52.590 --> 05:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
transmittance of glass at uh zero
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
setback properties on Main Street um
 
05:44:56.990 --> 05:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
specifying the number of inches that
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
stories above four have to be set back
 
05:45:01.190 --> 05:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh from the story below it unless you
 
05:45:03.070 --> 05:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
have a decorative spire on the corner
 
05:45:04.510 --> 05:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
and it started to sound to me listening
 
05:45:06.150 --> 05:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
through those hearings like uh maybe
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
they should design the build buildings
 
05:45:09.548 --> 05:45:09.558 align:start position:0%
and then pay someone to build them um
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
but I think at the end of the day what
 
05:45:13.390 --> 05:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
we want is to attract private investment
 
05:45:15.310 --> 05:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire housing stock and
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
the more we can do to simplify that uh
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
the better one of the themes that's
 
05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
going to come up in those conversations
 
05:45:23.350 --> 05:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
a lot is local control and uh one of the
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
things I I feel very conflicted on that
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
because on the one hand I think that
 
05:45:28.910 --> 05:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
decentralization is a good way to get a
 
05:45:30.670 --> 05:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
natural laboratory effect and see which
 
05:45:32.910 --> 05:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
Solutions work and which ones don't at
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
the same time that concept of delegating
 
05:45:37.070 --> 05:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
that power to the municipality is
 
05:45:38.670 --> 05:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately taking power away from the
 
05:45:40.468 --> 05:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
people over their own properties there's
 
05:45:42.070 --> 05:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
a need for this there's an opportunity
 
05:45:43.350 --> 05:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
for us to address it through new
 
05:45:45.070 --> 05:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
development and we're just strangling
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
that possibility out of existence okay
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
do you anybody have any questions thank
 
05:45:53.390 --> 05:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
you do there anybody else would like to
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
testify all right I will close the
 
05:46:12.868 --> 05:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:14.788 --> 05:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
right thank you um representative Cole
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
for that um I guess I want to ask
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I know we we heard a lot of testimony
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
today from different bills I appreciate
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
everybody sticking with me this long um
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully my scheduling will get better
 
05:46:28.830 --> 05:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
as time goes on but again you can't
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
account for um very important questions
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
from the committee as well so um that's
 
05:46:36.190 --> 05:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
part of it so um with that are I know I

minutes I guess I want to get the
 
05:46:47.680 --> 05:46:50.270 align:start position:0%
minutes I guess I want to get the
committee's

05:46:50.270 --> 05:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
05:46:53.468 --> 05:46:53.478 align:start position:0%
um straw pole and their interest in
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
voting one bill out of committee the the
 
05:46:56.750 --> 05:46:56.760 align:start position:0%

beautiful and I will second that should
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
we do it again no does everybody
 
05:48:35.708 --> 05:48:35.718 align:start position:0%

05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
right all right now I'm moving the
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
amendment all right
 
05:48:43.110 --> 05:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so uh the
 
05:48:45.788 --> 05:48:45.798 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that you have before you
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
this just changes makes some um modest
 
05:48:50.910 --> 05:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
changes to the appointing authority of
 
05:48:53.910 --> 05:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
the various members of the commission um
 
05:48:56.468 --> 05:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
I think the strength of this commission
 
05:49:00.190 --> 05:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
is in ensuring that the findings that we
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
receive from the commission have buyin
 
05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
from everyone that it's bipartisan and
 
05:49:07.628 --> 05:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
when we see these find findings it
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't become a partisan fight over how
 
05:49:11.788 --> 05:49:11.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate those findings are I think
 
05:49:14.910 --> 05:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
this this makes it um makes those
 
05:49:17.070 --> 05:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
findings more reliable for everyone it
 
05:49:20.830 --> 05:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
will give us more uh backup when we come
 
05:49:22.670 --> 05:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
with subsequent bills flowing from the
 
05:49:24.510 --> 05:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
research this commission conducts so I
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
think it's um supportive for both
 
05:49:30.510 --> 05:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
parties thank you represent Paige other
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
05:49:36.390 --> 05:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
this all right um I'mma give the clerk a
 
05:49:39.788 --> 05:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
to we're going to
 
05:49:45.628 --> 05:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
um call a roll on the the amendment so
 
05:49:47.150 --> 05:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's amendment
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:56.760 --> 05:49:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
0023

05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
0023
 
05:50:01.390 --> 05:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
0023 and I'm just give the clerk a
 
05:50:01.400 --> 05:50:06.830 align:start position:0%
0023 and I'm just give the clerk a
minute

05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll while the clerk's getting
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
organized I just want to say that um in
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
conferring with representative Paige and
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
um this came from another Senator as
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
well um I'm totally down with the
 
05:50:18.270 --> 05:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan nature of this commission I
 
05:50:19.708 --> 05:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
think that's the most important part of
 
05:50:21.628 --> 05:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
it is that it maintains it stays
 
05:50:22.948 --> 05:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan I think this is a great way
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
to start the committee on housing to
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
start on a good front um from there so
 
05:50:30.868 --> 05:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
um can I I I also just want to say for
 
05:50:34.350 --> 05:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
members of my caucus that I that Joe
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
asked me if I was comfortable or the
 
05:50:36.910 --> 05:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
chairman asked me if if I was
 
05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this so I want folks to
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
know that represent Aon can we have a
 
05:50:45.390 --> 05:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
moment to read the amendment and the
 
05:50:48.670 --> 05:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
original or can representative paage
