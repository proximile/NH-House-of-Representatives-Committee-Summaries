before
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
um the first time it was uh
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
and uh like all the other legislation we
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
sent their way um they were all all the
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
bills were tabled and killed
 
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh because of the coronavirus lockdown
 
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
uh because of the coronavirus lockdown
and

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
last time it was sent through it was
 
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.150 align:start position:0%
last time it was sent through it was
vetoed

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
vetoed
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i did read the veto message
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
how however there was a reference to
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
someone somewhere either in the
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
department of justice or in one of the
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
10 county attorney's offices who had an
 
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.430 align:start position:0%
10 county attorney's offices who had an
objection

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
of some kind and they
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
whoever that mystery person is has never
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
contacted me so i'm i'm
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not even going to try and speculate
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
i do want to mention though that there
 
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
i do want to mention though that there
is

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
a drafting error in the bill versus what
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
i requested from legislative services i
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask that this be
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
this bill be limited to just class a
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
felonies there was an issue with class b
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
felonies where i wanted to pass this
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
bill last year and then come back and
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
have asked the committee to work on
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
other class b felony related issues
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
and of course that didn't happen because
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the veto
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
so if you look down the only operative
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
wording in the bill is on page one at
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
part g not withstanding sub paragraphs a
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
and b for any offense under rsa 631
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
section one within six years of the
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
victim's 18th birthday
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
legislative services uh
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
for some reason decided to add in
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
this this additional language from last
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
year's bill which isn't supposed to be
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
there which is for
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
um class b felonies under rsa 631
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
section 2.
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
again this is something i have to come
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
back with another amendment on but i i
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
needed to hear from whoever the mystery
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
person was what their objection was to
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm told that there's some other
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
alternative language posted on the
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
internet somewhere but again no one has
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
contacted me by email by text message by
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
phone call i've tried contacting the uh
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and have not actually not heard back
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
from them in three years so
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a mystery and i i i feel
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
like what they're doing is handing this
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
back to this committee to have this
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee rewrite the bill and if
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
if you want to take that approach of
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
course it is
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
by rules of the house it is now property
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
of of the criminal justice committee
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's no longer my bill
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i am willing to do the legwork to
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
rewrite the bill through a committee
 
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.870 align:start position:0%
rewrite the bill through a committee
amendment

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
oh so the the reason or the rationale
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
for the bill is
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes people commit felony assault
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
against a child we have a statute of
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
limitations for felony assault which is
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
six years
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
which makes sense for adults i
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe in the need for the
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations the the new
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court argues that why
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
we need to have a statute of limitations
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
is to get the prosecutor moving not to
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
just sit on cases
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
and to assure that if if you're accused
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
of of a crime that you have a reasonable
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:06.710 align:start position:0%
amount of time
to

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
go back and get witnesses in your favor
 
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
go back and get witnesses in your favor
the

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
the reason that we maintain statute of
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
limitations for most types of crime
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
other than murder
 
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
other than murder
is

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
is
uh

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
that witnesses for the defense will
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
forget or they'll move they'll become
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
inaccessible you won't be able to to do
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state uh
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
subpoena and and and bring them in to
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
testify in your favor so the courts want
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
the process to kind of move not have
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
cases just sort of bogged down
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
the problem with
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
a felony assault against a child
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
is sometimes these cases of abuse start
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
when the child is four or five or six
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
so if if the victim is six years old
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
then by the time they're 12 years old
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
the statute of limitations has already
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
run out and what we've done with a
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
felony sexual assault against a child is
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't start the clock we
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't start the stopwatch until the
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
victim turns 18
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
so i felt that we should we should be
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
using the same type of
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
logic that
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
that yes there's still statute of
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
limitations under this bill
 
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.430 align:start position:0%
limitations under this bill
but

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
that clock shouldn't start until the
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
victim turns 18 when they're out on
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
their own and they're not
 
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
their own and they're not
potentially

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
either financially dependent on the
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
abuser or the abuser might still be in a
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
position of authority over them until
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're 18 years old once someone's 18
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
then it makes sense that the clock
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
should run
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
so that's the rationale for the bill
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's passed unanimously through the
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
house and senate
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
multiple times and hopefully whatever
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
rewording needs to be done
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
we can get that done before executive
 
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:51.269 align:start position:0%
we can get that done before executive
session

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
representative baberson
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony i will if
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
you bear with us for about
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
two two minutes you may be able to see
 
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.069 align:start position:0%
two two minutes you may be able to see
the

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
language that you were referencing that
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen yet
 
00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen yet
okay

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
the over under time frame would be about
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
two minutes i i would say so just bear
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
with us i'll hang around
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
oh did anyone have questions
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
i was encouraging just just
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
stay where you're at it should be very
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
shortly oh i assumed that somebody else
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you wish to be excused you may be
 
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.350 align:start position:0%
if you wish to be excused you may be
excused

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
excused
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
just to clarify to the members of the
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
committee there was a letter
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
that was signed by each county attorney
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it was actually drafted by the
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office that
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
reading the letter i believe
 
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
reading the letter i believe
it

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
discussed the intent of the bill which
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
was formerly hb239
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
and what it did was provides in that
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
letter suggested language that would
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish the same goal without the
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
fear of potential unintended
 
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.230 align:start position:0%
fear of potential unintended
consequences

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
suggested language was in that letter
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
the amendment is word for word that
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
suggested language
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't and i just thought the
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for not sending to you
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
should have an opportunity to look at at
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
least review that while he's
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
representatives you can you can have
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
this does kind of look like almost the
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
exact same wording
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
do you mind if i
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
run this down to legislative services
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
and and take out the
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
class b felony part so we're just
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
limited to the class a felony like the
 
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.829 align:start position:0%
limited to the class a felony like the
original

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're free to have them make a separate
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment if you
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
if you prefer that's that's the right of
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
any member of the body
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay and i'll make sure that it follows
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that this language was
 
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that this language was
specifically

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.829 align:start position:0%
specifically
word

word
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
i don't want to take credit for the
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
wonderful drafting of it it was it's

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
i do um
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's um
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
intentions notwithstanding
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to do
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
much better
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
getting a language that will
 
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.230 align:start position:0%
getting a language that will
pass

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
muster than
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
language given to us by all the county
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the attorney general
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably the most vetted language we've
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
had seen yet so
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think we should just go with it and
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
i basically echo everything that
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative roy has said
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
and the the concern with not being able
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
to sign this legislation that
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
obviously um people were in favor for
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
was because it was actually going to
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
hinder if if an assault had taken place
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know after a certain age
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want to
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
want to eliminate anybody because of
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
their age to be able to
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
have have their their justice served so
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
i definitely support the amendment as
 
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
i definitely support the amendment as
written

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
does the amendment that
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
does the amendment that's going to be
 
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
does the amendment that's going to be
drafted

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh also take out the part that the
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative was concerned about about
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
class b felonies is that
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
would that then be gone so it wouldn't
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's been offered was
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
the one that was recommended by
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
when i soon say recommended it was
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
suggested language that and what the
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
letter was really saying was they
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
understood the intent of the bill
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
however as passed by both the both
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
bodies there was some concern of some
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
and they it was suggesting if you if
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
this is the goal of what is wish to be
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
accomplished this is the suggested
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
language to be used
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is word for word going to match
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
what was suggested by
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
in that language i don't i'm not saying
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
that there any the attorney general's
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
recommending the legislation but i would
 
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.750 align:start position:0%
recommending the legislation but i would
also

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
be very cautious with changing the
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
language considering that this
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
was hb 239 passed on unanimously out of
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
this committee to last term and last
 
00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:42.789 align:start position:0%
this committee to last term and last
year

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it got all the way to the finish
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
line and out of a abundance of caution
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
that's why i didn't
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't make it so we're
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue of the
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
potential understanding consequences are
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
addressed by this so i i would be i
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh support
 
00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh support
any

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
i support everything you said i will
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
support the amendment my question was
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
about the process i thought i heard in
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
that the representatives mentioned
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
something about
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
class b felonies that he was going to
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
take out and he whatever he was going to
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
do with that
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if the amendment
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
as written now
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
takes that out or does not take that out
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
is it does it replace it so it's all
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
gone or not it's just that it's my
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
question i don't believe it's
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for me to tell another
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
member to not get
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
go ask for an amendment i that's not
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
fair to anyone so i i don't believe it
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
takes what's here doesn't take it out
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
that i believe the witness may have
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that but i wouldn't support
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you i just wanted to know
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
whether it did or didn't i didn't have i
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a feeling either way i was just
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
questioning what the amendment replaced
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
and what it did not replace thank you
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you mr chairman
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just subbing today but i'm a
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
little curious um why we're moving this
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
now until representative abramson comes
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
back because i think his expectation was
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
that we weren't going to vote on an
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
amendment until he had the opportunity
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
to offer another one
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if it wouldn't
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
if we could just delay this and give him
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
in order for an amendment to be
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee it would have
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
to be either a member or a sub
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
be a substitute on the committee and as
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
the chair excised my discretion i would
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
not recognize someone to offer an
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that wasn't
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
identical to the language offered as
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
recommended by the ten county attorneys
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
because i think because i believe that
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we've heard
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
extensively we've discussed extensively
 
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
extensively we've discussed extensively
for

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
multiple terms and i don't think i'm not
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
sure anyone opposes the intention of the
 
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
sure anyone opposes the intention of the
bill

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really the precise
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
language that we really want to focus on
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah a follow-up um no i i understand um
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
my concern was just really a
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
professional courtesy um so that when he
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
comes in he's not blindsided that we've
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
i ca i
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
well i i understand
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
what the point that you were making okay
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you members
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice and public
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
safety committee
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here to introduce house bill 1577
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
this bill may look very familiar it was
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
part of senate bill 122 that we
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was championed in this committee by
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
our friend from keene
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
did pass but
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
during the community conference there
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
were some issues with the
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
word used was an ominous bill that led
 
00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:34.630 align:start position:0%
word used was an ominous bill that led
to

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
the downfall of
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
this policy so this isn't the entire
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
portion of senate bill
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
122 but particularly involving
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
victims of
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
human trafficking it captures that that
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
and the the primary function of this
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
legislation was that when someone is
 
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.630 align:start position:0%
legislation was that when someone is
being

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
a victim of human trafficking that there
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
will be exempt from certain prosecutions
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
us particularly
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be exempt from
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
crimes other than violent offenses is
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
the crux of what this bill would do
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'll defer any questions during the to
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
when we discuss this during the
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for thank you for
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls joseph ebert new
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my

name is joe ebert it is eb ert and i am
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
a captain with the state police
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
overseeing our investigative services
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
bureau which is our detective bureau
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh i've
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
submitted my pink card today with uh
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
just informational or really a
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
comment that we wanted to make on this
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
in general we are supportive of the bill
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
we of course don't want to see anybody
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
who has been the the victim
 
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.390 align:start position:0%
who has been the the victim
of

00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
of a crime uh then be charged with an
 
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.309 align:start position:0%
of a crime uh then be charged with an
offense

00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
as a result of it having said that if i
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
can direct your attention to line six of
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
the uh of the bill before you where it
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
speaks about
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
any individual who at any point in time
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
was the victim of a severe form of
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
trafficking in persons
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh offense under 22 usc
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
and it's the the last portion of that
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
line where it says whether or not the
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
offense was prosecuted that we at least
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring for conversation
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
that seems like a very difficult bar to
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
try and attain
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
if you are looking
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to exempt somebody from a
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
criminal offense how would you prove or
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
disprove that
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to bring that forward as a
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
point of conversation and i also wanted
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
to mention that i've spoken with members
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
of the victims and survivors coalition
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
and we are more than happy uh and
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
it seemed like everyone was willing and
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
receptive to the notion of perhaps
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
amending the language moving forward
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
that is my testimony this morning i'm
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
more than happy to answer any questions
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
i i read whether or not
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
an offense was prosecuted is
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
to paraphrase is
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
either was or it wasn't so could you
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
clarify me what for me what how that
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
might be changed and why it needs to be
 
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.670 align:start position:0%
might be changed and why it needs to be
changed

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes so thank you for the question um
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
i guess what i the the way i was looking
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
at this if prosecution is taken on a
 
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
at this if prosecution is taken on a
given

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
charge then there is a clear and defined
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
record or there should be a very clear
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
and defined record of what took place in
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
that incident
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
so uh without that prosecution taking
 
00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:57.349 align:start position:0%
so uh without that prosecution taking
place

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:49:57.359 --> 00:49:58.710 align:start position:0%
place
uh

00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps uh there is a record of
 
00:50:03.349 --> 00:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
it uh perhaps there's not if if you were
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
to later be talking to somebody who said
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
well uh 10 years ago i was
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
a victim of this crime but there's no
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
documentation of it uh it would be very
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
hard to either prove or disprove that
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
notion and that's that's really what we
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
were getting at um
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking at how would you
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
how would you be able to support or not
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
support the notion of what was being
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
said to you if there wasn't an official
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
just for clarification i have a question
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
so um i just want to reiterate what
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
were we talking about the a defendant
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
you would be able to
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
run a triple i and you'd see whether or
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
not he's probably even if it wasn't
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
prosecuted but there's no record
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere of defendants is that correct
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
correct and and again i excuse me
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
victims yeah victims uh uh defendants
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
there certainly is but with victims um
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
it is it's not as clear and defined uh
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
but i just want to make sure that i come
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
across the committee in the in the right
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
way and saying that uh in general we're
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
very supportive of the notion of the
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh of this particular bill we just want
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't um we we
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
aren't put in a position at a later date
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
to not be able to approve or disprove a
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
portion of it
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and just based upon the
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
discussion that you had with
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative roy it really and i
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't thinking of it this way it really
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
is trying to
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to prove the veracity of
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
someone who says they were prosecuted or
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
they had this crime happen to them is
 
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.589 align:start position:0%
they had this crime happen to them is
that

00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
a correct interpretation it is uh thank
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
you sir uh it is difficult to prove if
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
somebody says that something happened to
 
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.349 align:start position:0%
somebody says that something happened to
them

00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:51:45.359 --> 00:51:46.069 align:start position:0%
them
uh

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't prosecuted or if it wasn't
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh investigated it becomes very
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
difficult if somebody says a period of
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
time ago this occurred to me
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
and there's no documentation of that
 
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.390 align:start position:0%
and there's no documentation of that
offense

00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't see over there representative
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
my apologies go ahead
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
so that uh same statement is uh also in
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
line b
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not the offense is prosecuted
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
the end of that also
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out uh
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative that that is uh just
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
language we would uh we would seek to
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
clean up uh as
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully moves forward too vague okay
 
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.829 align:start position:0%
hopefully moves forward too vague okay
thank

00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%

hampshire's human trafficking task force
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
was first established by new hampshire
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 194 in 2007 to research the
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
issue in our state and for the past
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
decade we have evolved to focus as well
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
on casework training and outreach we are
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
a group of law enforcement officers
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
victim service providers attorneys state
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
agencies and community stakeholders who

respond directly to human trafficking in
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
the granite state
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
this multi-disciplinary team is steered
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
by stakeholders such as the coalition

police and the u.s attorney's office
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
today i am here to provide educational
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
background on hb 1577 and how it
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
intersects with anti-human trafficking
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
work in our state
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
like many of our community members
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
before i began my work here on the task
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
force i had no idea how much this crime
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
impacts our state i quickly learned
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
after i joined that the second ever
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
federally prosecuted case happened right
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire last summer i
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
collaborated with our team when a
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
trafficker was sentenced to 21 years in
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
prison for trafficking children and
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
adults in our state using drugs to
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
entrap them we are continuously
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
identifying and interviewing potential
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
victims who have been connected to us
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
through local police departments crisis
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
centers and more avenues
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
in that spirit i would like to offer
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
some background relevant to hp 1577.
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
first you should know that there is a
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
victim offender duality that exists for
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
many of the survivors we work with
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes drugs are used as a tool of
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
coercion to suppress victims from
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
fighting back
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes victims are forced by
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
traffickers to commit crimes such as
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
theft or selling drugs
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes traffickers even use their
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
victims to recruit further victims and
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
traditionally these criminal histories
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
stick with survivors long after they
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
have managed to escape their traffickers
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
they label them like scarlet letters
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
preventing them from moving forward in
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
society getting a job renting a home and
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
building new and healthier relationships
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
the first point i would like to discuss
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that this bill codifies a largely de
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
facto practice in our state that we do
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
not criminalize and punish victims
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
currently defendants can meet the burden
 
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.630 align:start position:0%
currently defendants can meet the burden
of

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
proof showing duress by a preponderance
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the evidence moreover if someone is
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
forced to commit a crime that has
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
commercial elements that would actually
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
qualify them as a victim under the state
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
definitions of labor trafficking for
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
example being forced to sell drugs
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
besides our own practices this bill is
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
also consistent in spirit with federal
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
and numerous other state legislation
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
such as safe harbor laws
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
these laws prevent minors so any child
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 from being
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for prostitution and directs
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
juvenile sex trafficking victims to
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
non-punitive specialized services
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we also use
 
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.510 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we also use
juvenile

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
diversion courts across the state and a
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
growing number of adult adult diversion
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
courts to provide a place for victims to
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
heal and exit trafficking situations
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
without carrying the burden of criminal
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
histories with them
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
in october we provided training to these
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
programs across the state on screening
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
and referrals for potential victims
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
ending up in their programs we have
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
started piloting an anonymous tip and
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
screening form with manchester drug
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
court grafton county alternative
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
sentencing and merrimack county
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
diversion already leading to several
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
reliable tips
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
the legislator also passed legislation
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
last year that brings all juvenile
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
defendants with high scores on the
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences assessment
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
into these programs we hope this catches
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
potential victims who are falling
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
through the cracks giving them more
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to heal and work together
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
to remove them from these dangerous
 
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.750 align:start position:0%
to remove them from these dangerous
situations

00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill provides
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
codified language to what we know to be
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
best practices and currently seek to
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
emulate in our state victims should not
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
be criminalized they should be allowed
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
to heal and have opportunities and
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
inclusion in our communities thank you
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i am very happy to take any
 
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.349 align:start position:0%
and i am very happy to take any
questions

00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative boarding
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
my question um the previous testimony uh
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that
 
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
indicated that
um

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes our
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
people are not necessarily
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
prosecuted of the crime is it ever
 
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
prosecuted of the crime is it ever
possible

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
are sexual
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking crimes not prosecuted
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
because they're not sufficient evidence
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are a number of
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to identify
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
and prosecute these crimes um just off
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i can tell you that
 
00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
we saw hundreds of tips coming in about
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
trafficking in the state and
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
only move forward with a handful of
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
arrests and prosecutions
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
there's the issue of evidence for when
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
somebody is in a situation like that
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's also potentially issues of
 
00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.510 align:start position:0%
there's also potentially issues of
distrust

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
distrust
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
where you know victims are told that
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
they are criminals and that you know the
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
police aren't going to help them so then
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
they don't know necessarily that they
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
can come forward and receive that help
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
so is there any uh evidence or should i
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
say documentation that
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
such a crime exists but was not
 
00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.549 align:start position:0%
such a crime exists but was not
prosecuted

00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
we do have some very dedicated
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that looks into all of
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
the tips that we receive
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you they're members of
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
homeland security new hampshire state
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
police and merrimack county pd at this
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
point as well as collaboration with
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
local police departments
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
so we do have some basic
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know tips that are coming in and
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
some basic investigation and reports
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
that are run for any tip that we do
 
00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.470 align:start position:0%
that are run for any tip that we do
receive

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions the
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%

of the committee my name is lynn chalet
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm the executive director of the new
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire coalition against domestic and
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
sexual violence
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
we are the umbrella organization for the
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
12 community-based crisis centers that
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
serve approximately 15 000 victims of
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
sexual and domestic violence every year
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
and i am here to speak in support of
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1577
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
i had planned to share the history of
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
the bill with you but the sponsor did an
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
excellent job so you're all up to speed
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
on the fact that you have seen this
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of the current language in
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
front of you today when we look at the
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
state's human trafficking laws
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
specifically rsa 6337
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
this bill this law has successfully
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
worked to allow victims of human
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
trafficking to vacate convictions for
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
charges that are brought against them as
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
a direct result of them being trafficked
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
while also maintaining important
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
safeguards to make sure that traffickers
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
can be prosecuted whenever it's possible
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
as your questions have raised
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
this bill creates the right balance in
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
terms of maintaining the legacy of these
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
two important goals
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
and the way that it's achieved in this
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
language is by inserting the language
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
the word direct to ensure that any
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
crimes that are sought to be vacated are
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
directly related to the human
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking that someone experienced and
 
01:00:43.589 --> 01:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
it does a second thing as well which
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
ensures that the crimes that are vacated
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
are non-violent crimes
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
the second thing that's really important
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
and helpful about this legislation is it
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the intersectionality that
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
happens for human trafficking victims
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with the spirit of our
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
current law which is to protect victims
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
from being
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for something that they
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
likely had no choice in because that
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
conduct was so closely linked to the
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
human trafficking they experienced
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
however as we said victims who also
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
commit violent crimes should not receive
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity for anything they have
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
ever done and this language
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately narrows that
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
that exemption from prosecution
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the human trafficking field as you
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
heard from the prior witness we
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
recognize the victim offender
 
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.190 align:start position:0%
recognize the victim offender
intersectionality

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
intersectionality
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that we as a
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
society should consider the coercion the
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
force or the fraud that a victim of
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
human trafficking may have experienced
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
when determining whether or not they are
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
culpable for an offense
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
under our current law human trafficking
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
victims can already vacate non-violent
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
crimes which was a provision that the
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
coalition supported and held past
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we believe this bill strikes the
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
right balance for victims of human
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
trafficking who deserve opportunities to
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
vacate crimes that were committed as a
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
result of their being trafficked
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to respond to captain
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
ebert's um comment the coalition stands
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
ready to talk to any partners about any
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
language that may be needed to be
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
addressed moving forward i will say that
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
when you look at that provision it does
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
provide that there would be a hearing
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
related to vacating a crime
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
and that there would have to be a
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
finding by the court by a preponderance
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the evidence that the underlying
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
crime was committed as a result of human
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking so there are some
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
protections built into the language now
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
but the coalition is prepared to work
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor and other allies to
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
move this bill forward
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions thank
 
01:02:35.039 --> 01:02:37.829 align:start position:0%

01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for permitting me to
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
testify my name is melissa bruto i'm an
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
attorney and an advocate for survivors
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
of human trafficking
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
i have been an attorney for 15 years
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
i helped to write and oversee the
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
initial implementation of new york's
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
vacator law in 2010 new york was the
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
first state in the country to have such
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
a vacator law
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
i have also had the honor and
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to train attorneys
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
throughout new york state and also to
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
talk to legislators throughout the
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
country about the creation and
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
implementation of their vacator laws
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
so i have a pretty significant amount of
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
experience in
 
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.750 align:start position:0%
experience in
overseeing

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
the creation of these laws and also the
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
implementation on the ground from an
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
attorney a practitioner standpoint
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
we were able to pass an expansion of our
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
vacator act in just in last year in 2021
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
in new york that permitted expansion to
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
vacate crimes um committed as a result
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
of being trafficked both for people that
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
are forced into sex related labor and
 
01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
are forced into sex related labor and
also

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
non-sexual labor so we we also saw an
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
expansion of our vacator and we're very
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
proud of that because we truly believe
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
that survivors of human trafficking
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
need a fresh start
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
comment related to captain ebert i would
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
just like to note as somebody that has
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
really been on the ground for over 10
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
years in both practicing these cases and
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
and you know training other attorneys to
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
litigate these cases that i have never
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
seen that
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
point being raised in any state that
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
i've worked in and it's never been an
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
issue there are
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
a myriad ways that somebody can prove
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
that they are a victim of human
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking in fact
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at section d
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
the petitioner shall not be required to
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
provide any official documentation
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
because as as previously stated by other
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
advocates that can be really difficult
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
and very very few cases are actually
 
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.589 align:start position:0%
and very very few cases are actually
prosecuted

01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
incredibly few i want to just make that
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.029 align:start position:0%
very clear
however

01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
many many ways in fact eight are listed
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
here ways that people can prove that
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
they are in fact a survivor of human
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
trafficking so you know it
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
that is fully built into the law so i
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that incredibly
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
clear and that prosecution is is
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
certainly by no means the
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
the best way to prove it because they
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
happen so infrequently and not because
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the fault of of survivors
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you for
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to speak
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.870 align:start position:0%

abramson here again um for house bill
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
1340 uh yesterday
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of domestic
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
violence and trying to make the
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
state definition of domestic violence
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
match the federal definition
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
i did speak with people from the uh
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
department of safety yesterday and we
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
agreed that there were still a lot of
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
issues that had to be worked through
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and so we're we're asking you to uh
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
hold on to this for interim study um but
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
it is it is your bill now you're welcome
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
to to to do what you choose that there
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
were two main motivations for the bill
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a because it opens
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
up a can of worms it did create a
 
01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.830 align:start position:0%
up a can of worms it did create a
complication

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
complication
 
01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.870 align:start position:0%
complication
um

01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:37.669 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh complication
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
from some members of the the committee
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
is that they wanted to maintain
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
the ability of someone to get a
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence restraining order
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
against someone so that that was a
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
complication that that isn't solved by
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.310 align:start position:0%
the bill
and

01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
so we felt that uh the bill needed to be
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
held on to to get additional work i'd
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
hoped to get a committee amendment in by
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
today but we haven't had enough time to
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
work out all the details the
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
first problem addressed by the bill
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
um was a few months ago the gun line was
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
kind of overloaded every time there's a
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
new uh president elected whether they're
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
republican or democrat
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's been a huge surge a huge flurry
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
of new gun purchases
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems that exists is
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
when we have a different definition for
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that it forces the gun
 
01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:35.030 align:start position:0%
domestic violence that it forces the gun
line

01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
because of uh federal background check
 
01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.390 align:start position:0%
because of uh federal background check
rules

01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
um our our state gun line our state
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
police have to contact uh the courts
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
and um look at the specific disposition
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
of every single
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
prior restraining order or prior
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case to see if it
 
01:33:54.159 --> 01:33:55.110 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case to see if it
might

01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
prevent somebody from buying a firearm
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's because the definition is
 
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.350 align:start position:0%
and that's because the definition is
different

01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
the other problem is because we use a
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
much much broader definition for
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence it's possible for two
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
family members or two siblings to to get
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
into a fight and it can turn into a
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case whereas it
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't in most other states
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
have one bill that will will kind of fix
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
everything without taking away your your
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
an individual's ability to to
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh request a uh a restraining order
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
against someone if if they feel that
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's a still a violent situation
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
so for that reason and because the bill
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
is going to need more time and it's
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to need to be reopened i'm asking
 
01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
that the they'll be referred for interim
 
01:34:44.719 --> 01:34:51.189 align:start position:0%
that the they'll be referred for interim
study

01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair
 
01:35:39.750 --> 01:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative abrams a question
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're recommending interim study
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
why not
 
01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.990 align:start position:0%
why not
ito

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
ito
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
because interim study and itl are
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
probably going to have the same outcome
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
we agreed that the bill opens up a lot
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
of issues itl
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
usually provides some kind of hint or
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
indication that there's nothing
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
worthwhile in a bill
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
to be observed or dealt with
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
we refer bills for interim study on the
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
commerce committee
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
because we feel that there's there's
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
something worth looking at but that we
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
want the sponsor
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
or sponsors to come back next year with
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
a different bill that might try to solve
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
a problem differently
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
most of the bills that are coming into
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
commerce right now are getting referred
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
for interim study because there's some
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's some value there there's there's
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
something worth looking at
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
um but it's going to need something
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
structurally very different for next
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
year's bill
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
and of course you want to get uh input
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee before
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
answering my question um i'm not i'm not
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
too happy with the idea of interim study
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh how long would it take you to
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
redraft the bill to your liking uh well
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
definitely more time than you know
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
between now and executive uh
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
sessions so it's interim studies for
 
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
reintroducing a bill next year so that's
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
that would give us another year to work
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
on the details
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative the chairman inquire if
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
there were to be a redraft i'm just i
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
understand it's not complete but can you
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
explain perhaps what the spirit of that
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
would look like
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's to deal with for me that's the
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with the future problem of you
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
know you get another you get another
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
president or even another governor and
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's a huge flurry of gun sales and
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
that tends to overload the gun line
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
um so that's a that's a future problem
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
the other the other problem uh which may
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
require a separate bill which is that uh
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
you could have cases where you just have
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
family members or people living together
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
and they get into a fight
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
a physical fight and
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
what would normally be prosecuted is
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
simple assault it gets
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
viewed as a domestic violence case
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that was the intent
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
to have two brothers fighting each other
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
and both of them end up with felony
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
convictions or both of them end up
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
getting into getting domestic violence
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
convictions where they they wouldn't in
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
that particular case in most other
 
01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:23.750 align:start position:0%
that particular case in most other
states

01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
so by understanding it correctly your
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
concerns concern is that the two
 
01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.950 align:start position:0%
concerns concern is that the two
siblings

01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
siblings
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
were to get into an altercation each of
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
them could be charged with
 
01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.430 align:start position:0%
them could be charged with
domestic

01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
violence is that
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
correct or even just being a domestic
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
violence case it can create problems for
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
klein knight
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much chair
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
um if you could clarify you're more
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with holding up the gun line
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
than you are with protecting domestic
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
survivors from abuse we're not we don't
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to debate the witness
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
and okay that's that's a separate i have
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
an actual question
 
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:05.830 align:start position:0%
an actual question
uh

01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
on line four it says physical force
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
and five it says deadly weapon are you
 
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.709 align:start position:0%
and five it says deadly weapon are you
concerned

01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:39:12.719 --> 01:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
concerned
that

01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
you have narrowed the definition
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
to domestic
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
violence to just physical
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
page one line four or part four
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
some of those right now with or without
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the bill would would
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
would be a felony so criminal
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
threatening is usually a felony if you
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
threaten someone with an actual deadly
 
01:39:54.719 --> 01:39:58.149 align:start position:0%
threaten someone with an actual deadly
weapon

01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
but domestic violence laws usually just
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
automatically elevate cases to felonies
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of being a domestic
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
violence case
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
in other words we're we're opening up a
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
whole can of worms
 
01:40:10.719 --> 01:40:11.590 align:start position:0%
whole can of worms
by

01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill it it
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
and once you start opening things up
 
01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:19.350 align:start position:0%
and once you start opening things up
um

01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
then there's a lot of work that needs to
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
be got into i knew that when i
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill it was opening up a
 
01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
can of worms but i'd hoped that i would
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
have time to work with the department of
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
safety to go over all those issues first
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
and we spoke and agreed that just
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
referring this for interim study and
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
letting the committee go over those
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
issues open up those issues right now
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
before bringing in a bill next year
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls richard head
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
morning mr chair members of the
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
we had two
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
points that we wanted to bring up for
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
today one is that there is a
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence task force that the
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
chief justice has
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
has put together put it together in
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
december those meetings were ongoing
 
01:41:39.189 --> 01:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
the task force is anticipated to come up
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
with recommendations on legislation
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
as a result of their meetings today for
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
example is a public hearing they're
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
going to be taking public input this
 
01:41:47.679 --> 01:41:49.430 align:start position:0%
going to be taking public input this
afternoon

01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the full expectation is that coming
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
task force we're going to see
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations on legislation that we
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
would expect would be part of some bills
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
coming up next session
 
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
um so this bill if nothing else seems
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
premature before we can bring together
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
that that kind of evidence and the
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that's being developed in that
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
in that context
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
so for example in the in the task force
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's meeting we have on it judges
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
county attorneys
 
01:42:20.709 --> 01:42:20.719 align:start position:0%
service providers legal assistant
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
assistants victim witness advocates
 
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.590 align:start position:0%
assistants victim witness advocates
coalition

01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
coalition
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
criminal defense attorneys members from
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
dove casa private attorneys it's a
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
fairly broad spectrum of individuals
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
involved in that task force
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
and they are doing a fairly deep dive
 
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
into a wide variety of issues
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
so at this stage we would suggest that
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
putting together a single bill relative
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
to the definition of domestic violence
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh narrow the definition as compared to
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
what what we have today without having
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
heard the input from the task force
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
may make this bill premature may also
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
lead to confusion because if a bill like
 
01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:02.790 align:start position:0%
lead to confusion because if a bill like
this

01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
and now i understand it would be put
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
into interim study
 
01:43:06.159 --> 01:43:06.870 align:start position:0%
into interim study
but

01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
once you start creating you know a
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
series of movements in the definition of
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence you create a
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
significant risk of confusion
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
both in the public both in and in terms
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
of how
 
01:43:22.709 --> 01:43:22.719 align:start position:0%
these statutes are being
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
interpreted over time
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
and then finally you know there are
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
a wide there are a number of statutes
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
that use the term abuse and domestic
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
violence and as those terms diverge you
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
create additional opportunities for
 
01:43:36.239 --> 01:43:37.510 align:start position:0%
create additional opportunities for
confusion

01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
where you know the the
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
how you would start to interpret those
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
two words or those two phrases
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
in different statutory contexts can
 
01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh lead to you know some significant
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences without really
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
evaluating all of the statutes that use
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
these terms how are they uh how are they
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
used how they've been defined by the
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
courts and it just seems like a
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
process that's best suited for the task
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
force to really do the deep dive so with
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
that i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.189 align:start position:0%
that i'd be happy to answer any
questions

01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have thank you
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself i agree with you
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
this is uh this needs a lot of work than
 
01:44:20.719 --> 01:44:21.590 align:start position:0%
this is uh this needs a lot of work than
study

01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
um your this task force you spoke are
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
there any legislative members on this
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
task force um
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
i do not believe so but i'm just double
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
checking uh my list
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
does not have any legislative members
 
01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
does not have any legislative members
follow-up

01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up is the
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
purpose of this task force to recommend
 
01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
purpose of this task force to recommend
legislation

01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the task force is to
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
um evaluate they have a
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
a number of questions and it's on the
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
court's website is a sort of list of the
 
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
charge that that they have i mean you
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
may hear from some of the other speakers
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
as to some of the specifics but the um
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
some of them some of those do involve
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
legislative changes if
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately those are needed in order to
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
as part of their evaluation of those
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
issues yes
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
if the chair may inquire with the
 
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.350 align:start position:0%
if the chair may inquire with the
question

01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.310 align:start position:0%
question
so

01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
so
there's

01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
would changing the definition of
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence uh disrupt do you
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
believe that that would disrupt the
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
efforts of the task force i think it
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
would disrupt the efforts of the task
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
force and uh create some significant
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
potential confusion
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
among advocates among those in the
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
public who may be impacted by domestic
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
violence and create a time in which the
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
courts are now interpreting domestic
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
violence differently over a period of
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
short windows of time if next year were
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
to change again all of which could could
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
lead to uh potential damage and harm
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if i
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
can also inquire
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
will this task force put together a
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
report would you be able to have that
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
report forwarded to the committee
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely i can certainly ask anyway
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not a member of the task force but
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
um can certainly uh make sure
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
certainly any any report that they issue
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
made public and distributed but
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
certainly i assume the legislative body
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
would get a copy
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
not knowing the how the your commit your
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
task force is set up and and however
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
they get members or how they get that
 
01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.950 align:start position:0%
they get members or how they get that
input

01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
um do you do you know of any way that
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
that that task force might be able to
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
get as they consider these things get
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
input from legislators as opposed to
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
writing a report and then the
 
01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:45.669 align:start position:0%
writing a report and then the
legislators

01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
crafting legislation based on the report
 
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.109 align:start position:0%
crafting legislation based on the report
which

01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
seem to be much more timely i mean
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
certainly today there is an opportunity
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
for anybody to provide input
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
there is uh there are
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
they do have a way of
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
written testimony to be submitted to
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
them at any time
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
the task force was created by the chief
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
justice following incident that occurred
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of last year
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
an internal report was issued and that's
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
available on our website relative to
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
that incident and then there seemed to
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
be in in light of circumstances a need
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
to do a much more in-depth evaluation of
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence issues generally
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
so this task force was created by the by
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
the chief justice in order to really do
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
that deep dive
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't have sort of a
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
separate mechanism for
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
for legislators but i can certainly talk
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
to them about about that
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative newman recognized for a
 
01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
representative newman recognized for a
follow-up

01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
a legislator of legislators that have
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation like for being to
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
be considered as a bill could submit
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
that information to the task force for
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
them to consider it so that they would
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand maybe the direction that
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
certainly any legislation wanted to go
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you and and uh
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
certainly anything could be submitted
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
and any anybody who has
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts or input
 
01:48:13.510 --> 01:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
certainly can and if you go to the the
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
supreme court website um the task force
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
does have its own
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
its own website
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you drop down through the through the
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
links on the on the supreme court
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
recognized um thank you chair and um
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much to the witness um
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
basically answering all the questions
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
that i still had the same questions as
 
01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:40.719 align:start position:0%
my colleagues um just to narrow the
 
01:48:40.719 --> 01:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
my colleagues um just to narrow the
scope

01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
scope
 
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.669 align:start position:0%
scope
um

01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
one last question basically would you be
 
01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
one last question basically would you be
willing

01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
willing
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
even though you're taking a broad look
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
at all domestic violence and how it
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
relates to the current laws would you be
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
during your meetings so to be clear i'm
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
not on the task force um i'm not a
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
member of it anybody who has uh
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
suggestions or input i think would be
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh it would be filed through the through
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
the committee the the chair of the
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh as justice hans marconi
 
01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.270 align:start position:0%
committee uh as justice hans marconi
and

01:49:17.270 --> 01:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
but i think going through the through
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
the portal that's on the uh through the
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee website is
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
is the better way of approaching it i
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
certainly am not a member of the
 
01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:29.750 align:start position:0%
certainly am not a member of the
committee

01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%

01:50:53.599 --> 01:51:02.550 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls andrew
libernor

01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for uh hearing my
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning my name is andrew
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
libernois i am the belknap county
 
01:51:09.599 --> 01:51:10.550 align:start position:0%
libernois i am the belknap county
attorney

01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm here in opposition to this bill
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
i think this is a very bad bill
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
i should say before i begin that i have
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity yesterday i sent an
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
email around to all of the other
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh nine county attorneys in the state
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
and uh i heard back from seven of them
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the seven i heard back from there all
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
the other two i didn't hear back from
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
but so seven out of the nine
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
so seven out of the ten of us
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill i think this
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
i've submitted written testimony in
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and so i will
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
not go through my entire written
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
testimony at this point i do want to
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
highlight a few points however of
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
specific concern that i have
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
one is
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do in terms of
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
a person's criminal record and what is
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
recorded on their criminal record
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
as it stands now
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a situation where
 
01:52:04.719 --> 01:52:06.950 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a situation where
somebody

01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
engages in an assault on someone where
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
there is a serious bodily injury
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
and if it's a stranger that gets
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
recorded on a person's criminal record
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
as simply second-degree assault
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
but if it is a boyfriend and girlfriend
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
who are in an intimate relationship
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
that gets recorded on that person's
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
criminal record as second-degree assault
 
01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.830 align:start position:0%
criminal record as second-degree assault
domestic

01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
violence if this bill were to pass that
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
would no longer be the case
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
because this defines
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh domestic violence to only be
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors oddly enough
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
then that second-degree assault charge
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
would not be listed on someone's
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
criminal record as i read this bill
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
as domestic violence would simply be
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
simple assault
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
this is very problematic because as a
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
prosecutor it's important to me
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to look at a person's
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
criminal record
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
and see whether there's a history of
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
domestic violence on that person's
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
criminal record that's important
 
01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.109 align:start position:0%
criminal record that's important
information

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
for me to be able to decide about asking
 
01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.310 align:start position:0%
for me to be able to decide about asking
for

01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
for
bail

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
bail
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
preventative detention what sort of
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
whether to ask for a batterer's
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
intervention or some other sort of anger
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
management program for this person if
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're convicted so that's important
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
information that is now going to be lost
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass the other
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill is i think it
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
makes it very confusing in certain cases
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
as to whether the police can make a
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
so currently
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
in order for the police to be able to
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
make a warrantless arrest
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
for a crime that was not com for a
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that was not committed in
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
their presence
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
it has to be
 
01:53:46.159 --> 01:53:47.430 align:start position:0%
it has to be
abuse

01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
and a domestic violence relationship but
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
because this
 
01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:52.149 align:start position:0%
because this
bill

01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
would detach
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
the definition of abuse from the
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence there
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
will be cases
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
where a crime is abuse but it is not
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and the police will
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
not be able to make a warrantless arrest
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
so for example again a boyfriend and
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
girlfriend who are in a domestic
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
relationship but don't live together
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
in an assault happens in that case the
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
police will not be able to make that
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
warrantless arrest within 12 hours
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's a bad development
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
so in some
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think this is a bad bill i think it
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
causes a lot of confusion in the law
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
in an area where there's already some
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
confusion in the domestic violence laws
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
this makes it worse
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
not better
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i think it's bad for victims it's
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
bad for the criminal justice system so i
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
ask you to please vote in expedient to
 
01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.950 align:start position:0%
ask you to please vote in expedient to
legislate

01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
oh and i'll take any questions i
 
01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:40.950 align:start position:0%

committee
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is david
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
goldstein and i'm the police chief in
 
01:55:11.589 --> 01:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
the city of franklin
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
i've been a police officer for more than
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
42 years
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
and for 23 of those 42 years i was a
 
01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
member of the new hampshire state police
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
for the last 18 years i've been a police
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
chief in two municipalities
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
during my tenure as a member of the new
 
01:55:27.589 --> 01:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police i was assigned to
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
the major crime unit for more than a
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
dozen years
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
during that time i was involved with the
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
investigations of over 100 homicides
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
now the reason that i can say was
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
involved in that many homicides as
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the actual
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
investigations was because my primary
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility in those days was crime
 
01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
responsibility in those days was crime
scene

01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
scene
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and we had a fledgling crime scene unit
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
that went from
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh case to case to case if you will so
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
we actually um
 
01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
we actually worked more cases than most
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
in concert with the national average at
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
least 50 percent of those murders were
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence related
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
the oldest domestic violence victim in
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
one of my cases was a woman in her 80s
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the youngest was a girl who was 10
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
weeks old
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
the latter was a domestic mass murder
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
here in concord in 1991.
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
and if i'm not mistaken the only
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
domestic mass murder that we've had in
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
our state's history at least for the
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
past 40-plus years that i've been on the
 
01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
past 40-plus years that i've been on the
job

01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
james colbert murdered his year old wife
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
and his three daughters two and a half
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
years old one and a half years old and
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to testify in opposition
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
to hb 1340 for the new hampshire
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
association of chiefs of police i serve
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
as the chair of the legislative
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee for the chiefs
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
your chiefs are deeply committed to
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety of all victims of
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence and we are
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
just as dedicated to our
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to investigate such
 
01:56:58.480 --> 01:56:59.669 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to investigate such
offenses

01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation will make it harder for
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to do our jobs and only
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
create confusion when it comes to
 
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
investigating crimes of domestic
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
violence and making appropriate arrests
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go a little bit off script
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
here for a moment and share a
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
war story with you
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
i started my career with the derry
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
police department in 1979
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
and in those days we didn't have half
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
the statutory issues that we have today
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
to protect the victims
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
one night i was working on patrol and a
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
young woman was brought into the
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
hospital who was the victim of domestic
 
01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.910 align:start position:0%
hospital who was the victim of domestic
violence

01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
her live-in boyfriend had beaten her to
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
with an inch of her life
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
he'd thrown her down a flight of stairs
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
he kicked her he punched her even hit
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
her with a suitcase
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i took the report as best i could
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
because as you can well imagine she was
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
being treated medically at the time
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
and i arrested the assailant
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
a month later to the day
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
she came back and recanted her statement
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
now in those days we were too ignorant
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
to understand the mechanics
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
of what went on with domestic violence
 
01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:05.109 align:start position:0%
of what went on with domestic violence
victims

01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
and since she came back to recant the
 
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
statement in front of me she just
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
committed a misdemeanor in my presence
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
what's known as an unsworn falsification
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
i arrested her
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
i will stand before you or sit before
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
you as i am right now and tell you how
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to this day i am that i did
 
01:58:19.679 --> 01:58:20.390 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to this day i am that i did
that

01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
but that's the way things were done in
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
those days let's not go back to those
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
days let's keep it the way that it is
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
we believe that the changes the bill
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
proposed or the changes proposed in this
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
bill dangerously restrict the ways in
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
which victims can seek relief that they
 
01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:35.990 align:start position:0%
which victims can seek relief that they
need

01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
by way of another example a short time
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
ago there was a
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
horrific case in which a woman was shot
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
by her ex-partner in a murder-suicide
 
01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:43.990 align:start position:0%
by her ex-partner in a murder-suicide
attempt

01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
this occurred only a few weeks after the
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
woman had been denied a protective order
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
since then the task force has been
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
convened to look into
 
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
into these issues and we do have a
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
representation the chiefs do have a
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
representation on that task force
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we're looking to actually expand the
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence any
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
efforts to do the opposite should be met
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
with an immediate ito
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to answer any
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%

02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
belknap county attorney andrew libernois
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
will submit on january 21st 2022
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
concerning house bill 1340. my schedule
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
does not allow me to be present for the
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
january 21st public hearing on this
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
matter however i do want to ensure my
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
concurrence with the comments of the
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
county attorney livernois
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
is on the record with the committee
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
he writes i urge the committee to vote
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1340 as proposed as
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
i agree with those concerns
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
i agree that house bill 1340 is is a bad
 
02:00:33.119 --> 02:00:35.030 align:start position:0%
i agree that house bill 1340 is is a bad
idea

02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
as attorney livernoise points out the
 
02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence would be
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
the bill actually has nine sections
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
section two talks about first degree
 
02:00:49.199 --> 02:00:50.390 align:start position:0%
section two talks about first degree
assault

02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
but first degree salt is a felony so you
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
could never have
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence first degree assault
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
if you limit the definition of domestic
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
violence to misdemeanors
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
the same is true of the third section
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
which talks about second-degree assault
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
you could never have
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
secondary assault domestic violence
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
because second-degree assault is a
 
02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:14.310 align:start position:0%
because second-degree assault is a
felony

02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
felony
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
and this definition would limit it to
 
02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
and this definition would limit it to
misdemeanors

02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
the fourth section talks about reckless
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
conduct which can be charged as either a
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or a felony in new hampshire
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
however the definition talks about
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
the threatened use of a deadly weapon
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you had the threatened use of a
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon reckless conduct would be
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
a felony
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and again as we've talked about
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
you can't have
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
felony domestic violence because the
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
definition would limit it only to
 
02:01:47.199 --> 02:01:49.189 align:start position:0%
definition would limit it only to
misdemeanors

02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
section 5 talks about aggravated felony
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
sexual assault again that's always a
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
felony in new hampshire
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
since the definition of domestic
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
violence would be limited to
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors you could not have domestic
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
violence aggravated felonious sexual
 
02:02:00.159 --> 02:02:02.629 align:start position:0%
violence aggravated felonious sexual
assault

02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
section six talks about felonious sexual
 
02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:06.310 align:start position:0%
section six talks about felonious sexual
assault

02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
same thing that's always a felony in new
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire so you could never have
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
domestic violence related felonious
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
section seven talks about sexual assault
 
02:02:17.669 --> 02:02:17.679 align:start position:0%
which is in fact a misdemeanor
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
so it would be theoretically possible to
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
have domestic violence related sexual
 
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
assault under this bill
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
however if you go back to that
 
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.830 align:start position:0%
however if you go back to that
definition

02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
and you need an attempted use of
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
physical force or the threatened use of
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
we would never charge a misdemeanor
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault with physical force of
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
the threatened use of a deadly weapon
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
those would become aggravated felonious
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
so that section
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
well it would be theoretically possible
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
in reality you'd probably never have
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
domestic violence misdemeanor sexual
 
02:02:52.239 --> 02:02:53.910 align:start position:0%
domestic violence misdemeanor sexual
assault

02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
the eighth section talks about
 
02:02:55.599 --> 02:02:56.950 align:start position:0%
the eighth section talks about
kidnapping

02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
kidnapping
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
kidnapping again is always a felony in
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so you could never have
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence related kidnapping
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
because domestic violence would have to
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
the last section stalking section 9
 
02:03:08.159 --> 02:03:09.510 align:start position:0%
the last section stalking section 9
stalking

02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
stalking
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
generally is a misdemeanor in new
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire it can be charged as a felony
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
but i have a hard time imagining how you
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
would have stalking
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
that had the attempted use of physical
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
force or the threatened use of a deadly
 
02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
force or the threatened use of a deadly
weapon

02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
without that being charged as
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
a felony criminal threatening a felony
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
assault or some other type of felonious
 
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:33.589 align:start position:0%
assault or some other type of felonious
conduct

02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
02:03:33.599 --> 02:03:35.910 align:start position:0%
conduct
interestingly

02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
02:03:38.070 --> 02:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative abramson indicated that
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
his concern was siblings
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
engaging in a fight and that being
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
recorded as domestic violence
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
certainly in new hampshire if two
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
siblings were engaged in a fight they
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
could be charged with domestic violence
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
under rsa 631-2b
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
this bill wouldn't change that
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't reference rsa 631 2b
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't solve the problem that he's
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
indicating exists
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that's a problem
 
02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.629 align:start position:0%
i don't feel that's a problem
but

02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps his opinion
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
the other comment i would make is that
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
he indicated most domestic violence
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
cases are charged as felonies
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been my experience domestic
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
violence under 631-2b which is the new
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire domestic violence statute
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
the majority of crimes under that
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
statute are in fact misdemeanors and are
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
in fact charged as misdemeanors
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions if you
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
you the witness is excused thank you i
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
your written testimony excuse me
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative martin you're recognized
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%

i'm under the impression you would like
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
to see us itl this bill
 
02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:01.430 align:start position:0%

02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a question but
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question thank
 
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.189 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question thank
you

02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused the sponsor
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to maybe go to an interim study
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about an itl
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i understand the two differences
 
02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.430 align:start position:0%
and i understand the two differences
uh

02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.229 align:start position:0%
uh

02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
are we i'm

we
 
02:05:31.119 --> 02:05:32.229 align:start position:0%
we
withdraw

02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is lin chalet i'm
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the new
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire coalition against domestic and
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
sexual violence we have prepared
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
extensive written testimony to provide
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
to the committee today and since we're
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot of similar concerns about
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill i'll abbreviate my comments we
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
are here in strong opposition to this
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
bill and do urge you to itl the bill
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
it does significantly narrow the
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence and
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
frankly rolls back decades of work in
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
terms of responding to victims of crime
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are three significant reasons we
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
encourage you to itl the bill
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
and the first is how significantly it
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
narrows the definition of what domestic
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
violence is an assistant county attorney
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
andres really demonstrated that clearly
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
for you
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can debate the
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
pervasiveness of the problem of domestic
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
violence in our state in the last four
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
years our twelve crisis centers have
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
served over six thousand child and
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
adolescent victims nearly fifty thousand
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
adult domestic and sexual violence
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
victims they have answered over two
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty six thousand hotline
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
calls and our eleven emergency shelters
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
have provided over a hundred and sixty
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
thousand nights of shelter for people
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
fleeing danger
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
what we know is that domestic violence
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
is a pattern of coercive behavior and
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire addressed this fact in
 
02:07:22.079 --> 02:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
new hampshire addressed this fact in
2014

02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
2014
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
when we passed what we often refer to as
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
joshua's law identifying the very
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
specific crime of domestic violence and
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
you heard from attorney county attorney
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
libernoy this morning why that is so
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
important it helps prosecutors in making
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
also under this bill another concern we
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
have that i don't think folks have
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
touched on this morning is that for a
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
charge of domestic violence to occur the
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
victim would have to provide proof of a
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
physical threat
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
by a deadly weapon this completely
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
ignores decades of research of what we
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
know about how domestic violence happens
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't always involve a weapon
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
and often there are very nuanced ways
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
that offenders threaten coerce and
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
terrify victims of this crime
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
the second reason that this bill is
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
problematic is that it would limit
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
access to protective orders in the state
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire as you've heard from
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
other witnesses this morning under
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
current law there is a broad definition
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
of who may apply for a protective order
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
a family or household member or a
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
current or former intimate partner
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
by narrowing this definition we are
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
ignoring what really happens in many
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases sometimes it is
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
committed by a sibling sometimes it is
 
02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
committed by an aunt or an uncle it is
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
important that those victims have access
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
to the remedies that exist under new
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's already difficult to get a
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
protective order if we look at the data
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire between 2018 and 2019
 
02:08:53.910 --> 02:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
there were 8 000 petitions filed for
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protective orders only
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
38 of those final petitions were granted
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
if we narrow the definition of who is
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
eligible we are denying all of those
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
people access to that remedy
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the third and final reason uh we
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
echo what chief goldstein presented to
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
you today
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
if we remove this uh
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence and we
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
narrow it so much it will take away from
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
law enforcement the ability to identify
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
some of the most risky crimes
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire right now we use a tool
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
called the lethality assessment program
 
02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
it's often referred to as the lap
 
02:09:28.639 --> 02:09:29.669 align:start position:0%
it's often referred to as the lap
program

02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is a questionnaire that law
 
02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers use when they
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
respond to the scene to identify victims
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the highest level of lethality and to
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
link them immediately to crisis centers
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
keeping this definition the existing
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
definition of domestic violence is
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
imperative to support law enforcement
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
officers who are responding to the most
 
02:09:51.270 --> 02:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
lethal cases the ones where victims are
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
most at risk of being killed
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion we strongly urge this
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee for all the reasons you've
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%

do not have data though available in new
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%

those is not available to any of us
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
although it's an important conversation
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%

when i refer to high lethality cases

those are the cases where there is
 
02:12:45.910 --> 02:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
significant risk to the victim that they
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
will be killed or seriously harmed by
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%

representing victims and survivors in
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire courts statewide i am here
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
today to testify in opposition of house
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill 1340.
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
the terms domestic violence and domestic
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
abuse are often used synonymously and
 
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.430 align:start position:0%
abuse are often used synonymously and
interchangeably

02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
interchangeably
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to amend rsa 173 b1 to
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
include a new and separate definition of
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
domestic violence if interpreted
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
literally new hampshire would then have
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
a definition for domestic violence and
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
another definition for abuse
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's one particular outcome if this
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill is passed
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
another outcome is that this amendment
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
to the statute is purposely changing the
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
definition of abuse so that both
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and abuse should be
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably if that is this
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
case the case this bill has far-reaching
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
negative impacts which will make it
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
harder for victims to seek and obtain
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
protection from our courts
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
under current law victims may seek an
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
order of domestic violence protection if
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
one or more of eight particular acts are
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
committed or attempted to be committed
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
against them that includes criminal
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
threatening destruction of property
 
02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:17.599 align:start position:0%
harassment interference of freedom those
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
are some examples of the eight
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
if house bill 1340 were to pass it would
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
limit the qualifying acts to the use or
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
attempted use of physical force or the
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
threatened use of a deadly weapon
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
therefore those cases where the victim
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
was not physically assaulted or held at
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
gunpoint may no longer be eligible for
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
protection under our law as i've just
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are crimes which do not
 
02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.270 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are crimes which do not
involve

02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
involve
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
involve physical assault or a weapon but
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
are no less serious in terms of placing
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
a victim in fear for their safety and
 
02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.830 align:start position:0%
a victim in fear for their safety and
well-being

02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
passage of h.b hb 1340 takes protections
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
away from victims it does not enhance
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
their safety or make it easier for them
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
to access much needed relief from our
 
02:15:03.119 --> 02:15:04.149 align:start position:0%
to access much needed relief from our
courts

02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
courts
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%

02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
will assure you that if
 
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
we will likely have an executive session
 
02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:01.510 align:start position:0%
we will likely have an executive session
today

02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
and i'll be sure to recognize you to
 
02:16:03.119 --> 02:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
and i'll be sure to recognize you to
speak

02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:06.149 align:start position:0%
speak
so

02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking with me saying that
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
would you still wish to
 
02:16:09.599 --> 02:16:14.790 align:start position:0%
would you still wish to
testify

02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
because the other the other concern is
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not now
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
but if you are testifying you're not
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask questions i don't recall
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
if you asked any witnesses questions
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
02:16:24.719 --> 02:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
that's the
so

02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that but
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
i assure you i will recognize you to
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
this time we can now close the public
 
02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:44.309 align:start position:0%
this time we can now close the public
hearing

02:16:44.309 --> 02:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the public
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
house bill
1388

02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
relative to an unsolicited disclosure of
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
the committee calls
 
02:17:40.830 --> 02:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative the floor is yours
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you members of the
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee um i'm here
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
introduce hb 1388 relative to the
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
unsolicited disclosure of an intimate
 
02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
unsolicited disclosure of an intimate
image

02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
image
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would criminalize the
 
02:17:56.790 --> 02:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
unsolicited disclosure of an intimate
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
image otherwise known as cyber flashing
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
um if it were to become law it would
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
make the unsolicited sending of
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
genitalia via electronic device between
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
adults and misdemeanor
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
the action of sending this these images
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
is harassment with nearly no recourse
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
for the people who receive them when i
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
receive a message or email i expect to
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
have a conversation not sent graphic
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
images with no warning
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
these images are often sent without
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
prior contact purely to get a response
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
when i've received one the advice i've
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
give i'm given is to block the sender
 
02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
indecent exposure is a similar crime
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
with often no proof with similar
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
recourses i'm asking for in this bill
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
but a cyber flasher can send many more
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
images at a time and the proof is right
 
02:18:36.559 --> 02:18:38.070 align:start position:0%
images at a time and the proof is right
there

02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
i have included two studies done by
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
yougov in the uk which have not
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
surprising results almost 20 percent of
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
women in the study have received these
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
types of images
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
62 of them were received by text message
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
this is a pervasive growing problem that
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
is only going to get worse as time goes
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
on unless you put a stop to it now
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
on the back of my testimony i've also
 
02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:01.270 align:start position:0%
on the back of my testimony i've also
included

02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
the full law so you can see how it fits
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
in there
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
i know before there have been concerns
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
about um the effects on children that's
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
already illegal so i just wanted
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
um to be able to see the larger picture
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
um with that i conclude my testimony
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative marston you were
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative my
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
question is this how do we enforce this
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
law if we make this law
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question if we were
 
02:19:43.830 --> 02:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
to place this in law i believe if you
 
02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:44.549 align:start position:0%
to place this in law i believe if you
were

02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
the victim would have to report
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang you're
 
02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lang you're
recognized

02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
my question my my question is similar to
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
represent martians but it has to do with
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
accidental disclosure right so i
 
02:20:02.950 --> 02:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
intending to send it to someone who i
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with but i
 
02:20:05.990 --> 02:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
accidentally typo the number now i
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
knowingly transmitted the message but i
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
went to a person i didn't intended to go
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
to and that person reports me how was
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
that dealt with in this law
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question as i'm not a
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a police officer i am not
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
really qualified to answer that question
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
but um hopefully you would apologize and
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully that way to solve the issue
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
 
02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.590 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
recognized

02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um thank you
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that um a complaint or
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
any other line of
 
02:20:47.359 --> 02:20:48.469 align:start position:0%
any other line of
formal

02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
formal
 
02:20:48.479 --> 02:20:50.230 align:start position:0%
formal
um

02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
basically if you go to the police and
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
complain about anything there should be
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
a investigation conducted so this would
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
probably fall under that realm
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
to solve
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think so yes i imagine
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
again not a lawyer not a police officer
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
i imagine you would go to the police say
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
hey look at what happened and you'd have
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
the screenshots right there because it's
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
a text message
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill it states an image does that
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
include like video images or just
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of a situation where there
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
may be someone who's on a zoom call or
 
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
whatever and then
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know starts displaying some of this
 
02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:47.190 align:start position:0%
you know starts displaying some of this
behavior

02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
and it's not i don't know would it be
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
defined as an image even if it was like
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
video or
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question i believe
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the um
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
the area of criminal code that would be
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
changed by your bill
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
and it looks like the indecent exposure
 
02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:18.150 align:start position:0%
and it looks like the indecent exposure
law

02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
was put into place
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
in 1971
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
i know that that's before the internet
 
02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:24.230 align:start position:0%
i know that that's before the internet
existed

02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
existed
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
so is it your intent
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
essentially to
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
expand the indecent exposure laws that
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
we already have to include
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
um flashing that occurs over the
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
internet is it basically is that your
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
intent yes thank you that is my intent
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.439 --> 02:22:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair um i actually
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that my question has already been
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative the question about the
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
zoom is actually
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
one that i don't think had come up
 
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
during prior testimony on this bill
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it might be covered but
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
was that the intent to include that as
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
well so that all manner of
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
unwanted exposure in this way would be
 
02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:19.990 align:start position:0%
unwanted exposure in this way would be
covered

02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question um when
 
02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:23.270 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question um when
this

02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
when i first submitted this bill back in
 
02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:27.030 align:start position:0%
when i first submitted this bill back in
2019

02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:28.389 align:start position:0%
2019
2020

02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
um zoom wasn't really that big of a
 
02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
um zoom wasn't really that big of a
thing

02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
back then it was not quite um my intent
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
however since then um
 
02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.790 align:start position:0%
however since then um
yes

02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'm really happy that i would hope that
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
this includes that as well um actually
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
we've had an experience where my my
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
mother's a church group got um zoom
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
flashed or whatever you call it
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
um where you know these nice old ladies
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
doing bible study did
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
get um
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
to get hacked and it was um
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
very disturbing my mother was telling me
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
about it and i was like wow i have a
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill for the past two years um but yeah
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
um i do hope that it would cover that
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
however it would be a new hampshire
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing so it might get a little difficult
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative bert you were recognized
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
i think i remember this bill um
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not i almost think this question was
 
02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
asked so i'm asking it again if this is
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
the correct bill what happens if a boy
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
and a girl are together
 
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're sending pictures back and forth
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then one of them breaks up with the
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
other and then the other one goes to the
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
police like what they're sending me
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
um how do they deal with that
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that way there's you know not that
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
backlash of you know i'm gonna make you
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
pay and this is how i can do it
 
02:24:57.359 --> 02:24:58.150 align:start position:0%
pay and this is how i can do it
um

02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question again
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
consent would have to be determined by
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
the police officer of the court
 
02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:07.910 align:start position:0%
the police officer of the court
um

02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:09.910 --> 02:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i think it's pretty clear in the
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
bill that the consent does need to be
 
02:25:12.319 --> 02:25:13.429 align:start position:0%
bill that the consent does need to be
fair

02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
fair
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
um whether that's implied or not
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm digging myself a hole in this
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
question all right um but yeah
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
we understand that the witness is not a
 
02:25:29.429 --> 02:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
from me
 
02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
from me
um

02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
and i understand that
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
there are other areas of law
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
that determining whether a crime has
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
occurred depends on the ability of law
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement to determine
 
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:49.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement to determine
consent

02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
do you know of some examples of other
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
areas of law where
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
police would have to determine whether
 
02:25:56.319 --> 02:25:57.510 align:start position:0%
police would have to determine whether
consent

02:25:57.510 --> 02:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
existed before they can begin an
 
02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:05.270 align:start position:0%
existed before they can begin an
investigation

02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
for example um
 
02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.910 align:start position:0%
for example um
sexism

02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
sexism
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
assault at first um
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
but yeah crimes like that
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
so maybe like other
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes other
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
other crimes do
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
um exist
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
based upon consent and they seem to
 
02:26:26.389 --> 02:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
handle them pretty well
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
if i may the chairman inquire if i
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand that your testimony correctly
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
there are certain situations where there
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
can be human contact that is not illegal
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
because the contact is
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
consented to in one way or another yes
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight thank you
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
question this is more of um just um
 
02:26:57.030 --> 02:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
language question real quick on line
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
six it says uh who is 16 years of age or
 
02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:01.510 align:start position:0%
six it says uh who is 16 years of age or
older

02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
older
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
um would i feel like
 
02:27:04.479 --> 02:27:05.270 align:start position:0%
um would i feel like
uh

02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
we should strike it should be all people
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i don't know if you're
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
amenable to a
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
um amendment
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
but i'm unless they're baby pictures i
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
feel like we might get into trouble here
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
the back of my testimony i did include
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
the full law um currently if you're 16
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
years or younger it's already illegal
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
if you wanted it to be all the same
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
then sure but it already is covered
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and thank you
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative this is sort of a
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up to my earlier question and to
 
02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:48.309 align:start position:0%
follow-up to my earlier question and to
um

02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
others that have been asked but
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
in in the um current legislation is the
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question i'm
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
reading it now and i don't think it's uh
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
especially defined more than
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
it already would be in the law
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
all right follow up mr chair you
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
do you think it would strengthen this
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill if there was a definition of image
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
so that it could specify any
 
02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
not just a still picture but a video
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
image or a live
 
02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:27.030 align:start position:0%
in person

02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
communication like zoom
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so i appreciate the question i think
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
the reason why we wrote it the way it is
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
is just to keep everything kind of the
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
same so there's not a special law for
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
adults like
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
and children so that way the definitions
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
are similar
 
02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:48.710 align:start position:0%
are similar
um

02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:49.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
maybe but the reason why it's written
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
the way it's written is to fit well
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
with the law affecting minors okay thank
 
02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
with the law affecting minors okay thank
you

02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think i am going to ask that question
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair
 
02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.070 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair
um

02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that there already are
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
laws on the books uh involving images
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
in cases of child uh pornography
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question yes and i
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
belong i believe um they would also be
 
02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
part of like the revenge porn law which
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
i believe is one section down from the
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative bolden
 
02:29:31.270 --> 02:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking what i hope will be
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
my final question
 
02:29:35.110 --> 02:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
do i understand correctly um because i'm
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
looking at again the criminal code that
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
you gave us the existing law
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
do i understand correctly that under
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
current law sending an image
 
02:29:44.309 --> 02:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
and the word image is
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the existing law
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
already in use
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's sending an image to someone under
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
16 is a felony
 
02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
and there's currently no penalty
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
for sending an image to someone who's 17
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
18 or 99
 
02:29:58.800 --> 02:29:59.750 align:start position:0%
18 or 99
and

02:29:59.750 --> 02:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
do i understand correctly that you're
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
seeking to make it a misdemeanor to send
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
an image
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
a word that's already used in the
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
current law
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
to someone 17 or older
 
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question yes thank
 
02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:18.389 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question yes thank
you

02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
the committee lynn chillette with the
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire coalition against domestic
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
and sexual violence um we've also
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony and your
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions have addressed most of the
 
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.110 align:start position:0%
questions have addressed most of the
issues

02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
happy to be here in support of this bill
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
and want to thank the sponsor to her
 
02:30:51.520 --> 02:30:52.710 align:start position:0%
and want to thank the sponsor to her
commitment

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
there was a similar bill introduced last
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
session and we were able to work with
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
law enforcement prosecutors the icac
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
task force and advocates across the
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
state to come up with this language i
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
think representative bolden you
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
summarized effectively
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it recognizes that
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
sending these images right now to a
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
minor under the age of 16 is a felony
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
and it fills in a loophole in the law
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
and addresses that it would be a lower
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
level offense to send them to someone 16
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
years or older receiving an unsolicited
 
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
sexual image is disarming it could be
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
frightening it could be alarming
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it also is often used by abusers as
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
part of the grooming process so we
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
believe that it's appropriate for this
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be an offense but at a lower level
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
than it would be if the images were sent
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
to a minor
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to take questions i'm also
 
02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
aware that um assistant county attorney
 
02:31:41.429 --> 02:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
andrus is still here because i know you
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
all had a lot of legal questions about
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much chair and thank you
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and this might um
 
02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
if you can answer this maybe the um next
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
speaker can um roughly do you know how
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have any data on that unlike the
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
earlier questions about data but
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
certainly in terms of survivors that we
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
serve at crisis centers we know that
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
technology is used more and more in
 
02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
stalking and harassment to
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
terrify and frighten victims but it's
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
not really something we have specific
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
data on but technology is a tool that is
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:35.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm thinking off the top of my head
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
about as i'm reading this in the
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that talks about images to
 
02:32:45.270 --> 02:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
people who are 50 are
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
less than 16 years old
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking about um
 
02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:53.270 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking about um
where

02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
a 15-year-old is intimate with a
 
02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
older teenager or another teenager
 
02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
and they send pictures to their friends
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that happens but i
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
presume that it may happen would that
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
person be charged with a felony
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
if it was a minor who committed who
 
02:33:12.870 --> 02:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
actually distributed that if it would be
 
02:33:14.469 --> 02:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate i'd prefer to defer that
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
question to the prosecutor because i
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
think he'll have the most comprehensive
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge on that
 
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
um we had a situation in merrimack a few
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
years ago where a teacher sent
 
02:33:34.309 --> 02:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
images like this to a student who was 16
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
or older
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering are there any
 
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
statutes on the book that books that
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that would
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
provide more criminal
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
charges in that situation because i
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
could see you could have a high school
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
student at 17
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
and is under the power of a teacher but
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
that still would only be a misdemeanor
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
with this legislation absolutely we did
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
submit a list of the related statutes um
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
on the back of our testimony but again i
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
think the prosecutor is probably the
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
person best suited to answer the
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
questions about charging decisions okay
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
 
02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
though

02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%

02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls steve andres
 
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh office morning again my name is
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
stephen henderson i'm an assistant
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
county attorney in merrimack county um
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
as i indicated earlier i've been a
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for over 20 years
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to try and answer some
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the questions about how we would go
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
about prosecuting these cases or
 
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
what we would do in certain scenarios
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
i can indicate the scenario of
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
if you texted someone a picture
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
intending to text it to one person
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
it accidentally went to another person i
 
02:34:58.160 --> 02:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
it accidentally went to another person i
would

02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
personally look at that scenario
 
02:35:05.190 --> 02:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
very much in the same context of
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
if i had an individual who said
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
i was going to surprise my wife by
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
jumping out naked in front of her and
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
happened to have
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
jumped out naked in front of the wrong
 
02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
jumped out naked in front of the wrong
person

02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
um i would look at whether or not that
 
02:35:20.950 --> 02:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
was reasonable
 
02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.550 align:start position:0%
was reasonable
um

02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
i would look at the two phone numbers i
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
would look at whether they were
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
a digit off or completely different
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
i'd look at
 
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
whether there was evidence that this
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
person had done this in the past and all
 
02:35:35.590 --> 02:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
that would go into
 
02:35:37.110 --> 02:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
a decision whether or not to charge the
 
02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:41.190 align:start position:0%
a decision whether or not to charge the
person

02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody has any
 
02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.389 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody has any
questions

02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
if the chair may inquire and thank you
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you for taking
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
is any opinion on the so it says
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
on lines line 7
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
it references an image
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
would it change the
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
intent or the how this vlog would be
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
applied if it's an image or a lot live
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
video feed if we maybe just tighten that
 
02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:10.710 align:start position:0%
video feed if we maybe just tighten that
up

02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:11.429 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
necessary i don't know that that would
 
02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:18.790 align:start position:0%
necessary i don't know that that would
necessarily

02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
be necessary because i don't know that a
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
live stream
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
at least to me
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody had was live streaming
 
02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:34.830 align:start position:0%
if somebody had was live streaming
themself

02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
themself
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
um fornicating to a person over 16
 
02:36:40.950 --> 02:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i would say well it
 
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't an image because it was a live
 
02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:54.309 align:start position:0%
wasn't an image because it was a live
stream

02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative bert you were recognized
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
again back to that scenario of um
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
if a couple are together
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then they break up
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
and they come and see you or the police
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then see you right yeah look what's
 
02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:14.710 align:start position:0%
and then see you right yeah look what's
happening

02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
how are you going to determine
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
that there was consent or there wasn't
 
02:37:18.479 --> 02:37:21.429 align:start position:0%
that there was consent or there wasn't
consent

02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
i think what it would come down to is
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
when i look at this statute we would
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
at trial that the recipient has not
 
02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
indicated by speech or conduct
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they freely consented to the
 
02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
receipt of the image
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
so i would look at
 
02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:36.469 align:start position:0%
so i would look at
the

02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
the background of that relationship i
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
think that you'd likely have
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
the person perhaps saying at one point
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
this was consensual
 
02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
and if they didn't explicitly then
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
indicate it is no longer consensual
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think we would not be able to bring
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative you recognize for a
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
02:38:03.270 --> 02:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
now another scenario is i received an
 
02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
now another scenario is i received an
email

02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
email
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
that i was in as an attachment
 
02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
i was not going to open it up because i
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
didn't recognize it good idea yes
 
02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
didn't recognize it good idea yes
well

02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
well then i get a text john opened this
 
02:38:18.399 --> 02:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
well then i get a text john opened this
email

02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
email
 
02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
email
and

02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
the email was from australia
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
so when i inquired about that because i
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
looked into it a little further i go
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
this thing's from australia i'm not
 
02:38:31.990 --> 02:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
opening it so when i inquired it was
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
from somebody i knew and they have
 
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
software that don't put them in new
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire they put it puts them in
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
australia and i'm going how does this
 
02:38:40.399 --> 02:38:41.429 align:start position:0%
australia and i'm going how does this
happen

02:38:41.429 --> 02:38:41.439 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm confused on how it happens
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
but i guess it does how are we going to
 
02:38:48.389 --> 02:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
enforce this law with somebody sitting
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
emailing down to australia or that's
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
where the ip goes and comes back
 
02:38:56.070 --> 02:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
i think it would be very difficult to
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
enforce under that scenario um
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
but that's something that we face
 
02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:03.429 align:start position:0%
but that's something that we face
with

02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
with all sorts of laws whether it's a
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
whether this bill passes or not that's a
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
problem in law enforcement that we see
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of people
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
harassing threatening
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
committing financial crimes committing
 
02:39:20.319 --> 02:39:21.830 align:start position:0%
committing financial crimes committing
online

02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:21.840 align:start position:0%

02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:22.870 align:start position:0%
online
fraud

02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that people are able to hide their
 
02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:25.830 align:start position:0%
is that people are able to hide their
their

02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
actual location or their ip address
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
are you saying that's what
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be part of the
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
investigation i think
 
02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
you could certainly frustrate an
 
02:39:45.359 --> 02:39:50.630 align:start position:0%
you could certainly frustrate an
investigation

02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
um in reviewing the statute it it talks
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
um about images of yourself
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't seem to cover um
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
just random images that could still be
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
offensive would that be covered under
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
the gross lewdness part of the statue or
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
does it need the statute perhaps need to
 
02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
does it need the statute perhaps need to
include

02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
lurid images
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
or and i know there's been some issues
 
02:40:21.190 --> 02:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
with a definition of pornography
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
to include for example cartoons like
 
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
manga or whatever
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that
 
02:40:29.830 --> 02:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the language in this statute that refers
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
to an image of himself or herself
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
fornicating exposing his or her genitals
 
02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
mirrors the language that already exists
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
in 645-1 with reference to people under
 
02:40:41.520 --> 02:40:42.950 align:start position:0%
in 645-1 with reference to people under
16.

02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
16.
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
i certainly do think that
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say that
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's a loophole but this statute
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't cover
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
sending a picture of another person's
 
02:40:55.910 --> 02:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
genitals and i think that
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
that currently
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you sent a picture of another
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
person's genitals to a person under 18
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
we could conceivably charge that with
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
providing minors with harmful materials
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:41:09.279 --> 02:41:11.429 align:start position:0%
which is
um

02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i know that statute off
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i want to say it's in
 
02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i want to say it's in
the

02:41:15.190 --> 02:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:16.389 align:start position:0%
the
500

02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
series it's in the public justice
 
02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:19.110 align:start position:0%
series it's in the public justice
section

02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
so there is a statute that prohibits um
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
exposing minors to harmful materials
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
by sending them a picture of genitals
 
02:41:29.429 --> 02:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
for a person under 18.
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that's a misdemeanor
 
02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
i believe that's a misdemeanor
follow-up

02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
president of rory recognized for a
 
02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up at the
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
at the risk of delving into this alone
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
too deep
 
02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:42.469 align:start position:0%
too deep
how

02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
for example you charge
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
me with sending a photo to someone under
 
02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
and i say
 
02:41:53.269 --> 02:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's not mine
 
02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
are we doing how do you do that
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and again this mirrors language that's
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
already in
 
02:42:06.790 --> 02:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
the statute that prosecutors already
 
02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:07.830 align:start position:0%
the statute that prosecutors already
have

02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
you know difficulty proving
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think realistically though this
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
this is less about random people sending
 
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
pictures of their genitals to other
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
random people yeah and i think this
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
is more of a
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
you meet on a dating website you
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
exchange a couple emails you
 
02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
know who this person is and they send
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
you a picture
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
and make some comment about
 
02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
look at my spectacular genitals yeah and
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
are admitting that this is in fact a
 
02:42:45.190 --> 02:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
um follow-up
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
i i i totally agree with the the
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
sentiment and
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
and most of the statute i just want to
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we make it enforceable i
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to pass something that feels
 
02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
great but isn't workable so if you have
 
02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
a suggestion we would appreciate it
 
02:43:04.710 --> 02:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
you certainly could expand the uh
 
02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
you certainly could expand the uh
the

02:43:05.990 --> 02:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
his or her genitals to
 
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
human genitals or any genitals or
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
whatever language you felt was
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair did i understand you
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
correctly to say you had a concern about
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't concerned but that you
 
02:43:29.190 --> 02:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
didn't believe the word image
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
would also reference video
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
i believe the word image would reference
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
video okay
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
did you uh mention that that image is
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
defined in the current law 645.1 i don't
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
believe it is defined in six forty five
 
02:43:51.279 --> 02:43:52.230 align:start position:0%
believe it is defined in six forty five
one

02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:55.269 --> 02:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:43:58.389 --> 02:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:43:58.399 --> 02:43:59.670 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:43:59.670 --> 02:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you remember the
 
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
question i asked miss schulich but
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
um we had a situation in merrimack where
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
a teacher was sending images of himself
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
to a student who was 16
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and with this is there any statute that
 
02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that would
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
elevate that crime
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
over something
 
02:44:23.510 --> 02:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a non-teacher doing it
 
02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anything that would
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
make it more illegal for a teacher to do
 
02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:28.630 align:start position:0%
make it more illegal for a teacher to do
that

02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative bolden
 
02:44:46.150 --> 02:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so i
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
know that um the questions so far have
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of different concerns
 
02:44:52.950 --> 02:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
about the terminology
 
02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
with the intent being
 
02:44:54.640 --> 02:44:55.100 align:start position:0%
with the intent being
to

02:44:55.100 --> 02:44:55.110 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:45:00.150 --> 02:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
extend the indecent exposure
 
02:45:02.309 --> 02:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
law to the internet
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
are there any changes that you'd
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
recommend to the wording and i know i'm
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
kind of putting you on the spot but if
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
i don't see any changes that i would
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
recommend i don't know that this
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily extends it to the internet
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
it would
 
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
extend it to somebody
 
02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:24.150 align:start position:0%
extend it to somebody
um

02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
providing it transmitting it to another
 
02:45:26.479 --> 02:45:28.710 align:start position:0%
providing it transmitting it to another
person

02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether that be through text or email
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
but i don't think this would necessarily
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know criminalize someone from
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
at this time we'll now close the public
 
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:51.389 --> 02:46:51.399 align:start position:0%
just uh the members of the community in
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%

02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
executive session on

house bill

02:47:14.479 --> 02:47:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:47:25.349 --> 02:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
at this time we are now opening the
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 1340
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%

criminal convictions for domestic
 
02:47:36.070 --> 02:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
violence at this time the chair
 
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative klein knight
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%

i was only 15 years old when i moved
here

02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
to the us
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
um i didn't know the language i didn't
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
know my rights
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
i was hiding
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
on a closet when my ex-husband used to
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
hit me
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
the neighbor used to call the cops
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
and he used to hide me in the closet and
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
he used to tell me not to get out of the
 
02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:28.630 align:start position:0%
he used to tell me not to get out of the
closet

02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
closet
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
because he didn't want to get in trouble
 
02:49:35.349 --> 02:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
so he never got in trouble for
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
it would take away the rights for
 
02:49:49.429 --> 02:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:49.439 --> 02:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:49:50.630 --> 02:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
be able to put charges to someone
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
like my ex-husband who
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
not only
 
02:49:56.880 --> 02:49:57.990 align:start position:0%
not only
he

02:49:57.990 --> 02:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
he
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
he hit me but
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
mentally and emotionally he
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
he took away my two kids
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
because he told me that if i put any
 
02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
because he told me that if i put any
charges

02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
charges
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence against him
 
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
he was gonna take away my kids from me
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
and he was gonna take my right to be in
 
02:50:25.750 --> 02:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
me not knowing very well the language
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
i believe him
 
02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
my son he was two years old
 
02:50:36.389 --> 02:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
my daughter was six years old
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
when he took them to north carolina
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
i was afraid to lose my
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
my right to be in this country
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
and not be able to see my kids never
 
02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.670 align:start position:0%
and not be able to see my kids never
again

02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
that son that needed
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
i wish i knew my rights
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
back in the days
 
02:50:59.910 --> 02:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
because i felt like he took away the
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
right for me to be a mother
 
02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the right for me
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
for my kids to have a mother
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
i feel guilty
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
i feel sad that i didn't have the chance
 
02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
to be there for my daughter when she was
 
02:51:18.150 --> 02:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.269 --> 02:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
support the ideal for this bill because
 
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
trust me
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's many ways
 
02:51:27.990 --> 02:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
domestic violence happened
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
especially for people like myself
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
when we don't know what is right and
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
what is wrong
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%

representative perez um thank you mr
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
chairman i
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
the the state has worked very hard to be
 
02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
where we currently are with with the
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
laws in protecting victims of domestic
 
02:52:05.590 --> 02:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
violence and
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think it is imperative that we keep
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
the measures in place to help these
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
victims especially considering that we
 
02:52:15.750 --> 02:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
had a very good piece of legislation
 
02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
that would have helped these victims
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
with their abusers and unfortunately we
 
02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
were not able to get that legislation
 
02:52:23.279 --> 02:52:30.790 align:start position:0%
were not able to get that legislation
passed

02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
this time the the matter will now be put
 
02:52:34.230 --> 02:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
to question if you were in support of
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:21.750 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna mention or go into detail
but

03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh technically it theoretically could be
 
03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
considered uh money in exchange for sex
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
so it because of the the broad way that
 
03:01:30.399 --> 03:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
so it because of the the broad way that
our

03:01:31.750 --> 03:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh prostitution and related offenses are
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
defined are very broad in new hampshire
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
that that they could be caught under
 
03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:40.550 align:start position:0%
that that they could be caught under
that

03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:41.990 align:start position:0%
that
that

03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.070 align:start position:0%
that
scope

03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
scope
 
03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:45.110 align:start position:0%
scope
so

03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:47.670 --> 03:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't want to see
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
cases where people are just doing a
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
webcam or doing doing something like
 
03:01:52.710 --> 03:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
that they may even be a couple and they
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
could still
 
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
theoretically get prosecuted so this is
 
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
was when i was living in manchester i
 
03:02:05.990 --> 03:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
started to see more and more often that
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
sex workers were were out in the street
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
and what happens in most western
 
03:02:12.389 --> 03:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
countries is they they recognize that
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's a problem but they either
 
03:02:15.910 --> 03:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
tolerate it they decriminalize it
 
03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:17.030 align:start position:0%
tolerate it they decriminalize it
they've

03:02:17.030 --> 03:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
they've
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
legalized sex work or
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulate it in some way
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
in order to get it off the street and
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
some western countries have some type of
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
red light district or pink like district
 
03:02:32.070 --> 03:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
of some kind in a commercial setting
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
um but most of them it's allowed only in
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
the privacy of your own home
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that's just that's just to get the
 
03:02:41.269 --> 03:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
activity off the street and that's kind
 
03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.670 --> 03:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
i have had a few
 
03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
people i've known over the years
 
03:02:50.309 --> 03:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
actually get caught up in this who were
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
not engaged in prostitution at all and
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
they still got they were still arrested
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
they were still charged and they still
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
end up with a criminal record they ended
 
03:02:59.269 --> 03:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
up at the valley street jail
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
even though they were not actually
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
sex workers in any true sense of the
 
03:03:04.319 --> 03:03:05.349 align:start position:0%
sex workers in any true sense of the
word

03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:03:07.269 --> 03:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
and the reason is
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
that something as simple as photography
 
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
can potentially fall under this penumbra
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
because it's so broad
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so what i've tried to do is come up
 
03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:18.070 align:start position:0%
and so what i've tried to do is come up
with

03:03:18.070 --> 03:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
a very simple carve out to say
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
that if somebody's just in the privacy
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
of their own home that we're not going
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
to have enforcement in new hampshire
 
03:03:29.670 --> 03:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
towns do retain the ability
 
03:03:31.830 --> 03:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
to find somebody ten dollars on a first
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
offense or fifty dollars on a second
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
time offense but i i wouldn't i i can't
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
imagine too many towns or cities
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
actually uh
 
03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
going ahead and trying to to enforce
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
this violation level offense they could
 
03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
if they they really really needed to
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
or if they really really um if there
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
were public support for that it's it's a
 
03:03:53.590 --> 03:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
local control issue but
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
i didn't think
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't think that it's a good use of
 
03:03:57.520 --> 03:03:58.469 align:start position:0%
i didn't think that it's a good use of
of

03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
of public resources to go into people's
 
03:04:02.230 --> 03:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
homes and
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
and try to punish them for what they're
 
03:04:06.150 --> 03:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
doing the privacy of their own home
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
we have seen that when prostitution is
 
03:04:09.990 --> 03:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
made illegal in general that it ends up
 
03:04:11.190 --> 03:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
out in the street
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
and that because of the arrests women
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
mostly women working
 
03:04:19.349 --> 03:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
end up having to get a pimp and the pimp
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
is usually where the abuse comes in
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
some serial killers have admitted that
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
they they target
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh prostitutes
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
because they found that they're easier
 
03:04:32.309 --> 03:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
targets that they're isolated we passed
 
03:04:34.870 --> 03:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
an immunity law a couple of years ago
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
through this committee
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
um to guarantee that the women who are
 
03:04:41.910 --> 03:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
working in that in that field are able
 
03:04:44.550 --> 03:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
to go to the the police without risking
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
prosecution but it's not a it's not a
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
completely uh
 
03:04:49.439 --> 03:04:50.630 align:start position:0%
completely uh
universal

03:04:50.630 --> 03:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
universal
 
03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
universal
immunity

03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they have they still are actually
 
03:04:56.710 --> 03:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
risking being arrested if they come
 
03:04:59.590 --> 03:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
forward and report a crime
 
03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:00.630 align:start position:0%
forward and report a crime
so

03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
for that reason
 
03:05:04.710 --> 03:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
and others i felt that the bill was
 
03:05:07.990 --> 03:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
necessary um i tried to come up with
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
every possible compromise that any
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
member of this committee has ever
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
brought up that where they had a concern
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
people weren't using condoms or they
 
03:05:18.630 --> 03:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
weren't using protection or there were
 
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that some people weren't getting
 
03:05:22.389 --> 03:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
tested so i tried to
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
accommodate every possible uh
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh concern that people had and it's uh
 
03:05:30.469 --> 03:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
in this particular version of the bill
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's limited just to one's own home so
 
03:05:33.359 --> 03:05:34.309 align:start position:0%
it's limited just to one's own home so
it's

03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:05:34.319 --> 03:05:35.110 align:start position:0%
it's
it

03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:05:37.269 --> 03:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
you still wouldn't be allowed to
 
03:05:38.950 --> 03:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
solicit outside you wouldn't be allowed
 
03:05:40.469 --> 03:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
to advertise under the bill you wouldn't
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
be allowed to
 
03:05:41.920 --> 03:05:43.110 align:start position:0%
be allowed to
even

03:05:43.110 --> 03:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:05:44.950 --> 03:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of promoting it on the
 
03:05:48.630 --> 03:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it isn't legalized or
 
03:05:50.479 --> 03:05:52.309 align:start position:0%
that aspect of it isn't legalized or
decriminalized

03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
decriminalized
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's allowed under this
 
03:05:56.230 --> 03:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's decriminalized is
 
03:05:58.230 --> 03:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
people engaging in any type of sexual
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll take i'll take
 
03:06:05.040 --> 03:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll take i'll take
questions

03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:17.910 --> 03:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:06:19.269 --> 03:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:06:21.030 --> 03:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
i feel like there's a smorgasbord of
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.520 --> 03:06:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
how

03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
so if a person hires
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
if somebody hires a person
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
and and then they're supposed to go have
 
03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know this test
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry a person hires somebody uses a
 
03:06:43.750 --> 03:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
false name
 
03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
because i'm sure they probably don't
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
want you know
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
their name to be all through that
 
03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
their name to be all through that
newspaper

03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
newspaper
 
03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:50.070 align:start position:0%
newspaper
so

03:06:50.070 --> 03:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
in this legislation you have about the
 
03:06:54.230 --> 03:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
person having to be tested yearly for
 
03:06:57.030 --> 03:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted diseases and how
 
03:06:57.040 --> 03:06:58.309 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted diseases and how
exactly

03:06:58.309 --> 03:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:07:02.070 --> 03:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
would this sex worker go about notifying
 
03:07:09.510 --> 03:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
they can just take an annual test and if
 
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
they really want to post it on the wall
 
03:07:13.520 --> 03:07:14.630 align:start position:0%
they really want to post it on the wall
like

03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:07:15.429 --> 03:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
you know when you go into the
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
chiropractor or dentist's office and
 
03:07:18.550 --> 03:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
they have their license i'm sure that
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
they can post it on the wall if they
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to if anybody
 
03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:23.110 align:start position:0%
wanted to if anybody
objected

03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
objected
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
or if anyone raised a question about it
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think that if somebody were actually
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
and use you know
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
hire this kind of service that they
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
should probably use a condom regardless
 
03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of safety and in fact
 
03:07:40.389 --> 03:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
90 plus percent of the time people
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
are doing that right now
 
03:07:42.560 --> 03:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
are doing that right now
um

03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:07:45.359 --> 03:07:46.389 align:start position:0%
but i
i

03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
i've never even considered
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know someone going in and then and
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
then wanting to check the license on the
 
03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
wall for that
 
03:07:55.349 --> 03:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody wanted to they could just
 
03:07:58.230 --> 03:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
they could post that up on the wall in
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
03:08:04.160 --> 03:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
recognized

03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
i i just want to make sure that i am
 
03:08:14.870 --> 03:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
correctly reading this bill as it's
 
03:08:16.950 --> 03:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
written in front of me
 
03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:18.070 align:start position:0%
written in front of me
um

03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
and you can correct me if i'm wrong
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
and everything on page one and
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
everything on page two except for the
 
03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
one portion that is uh parentheses
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
parenthesis z on parentheses
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
where you it's lined out
 
03:08:36.309 --> 03:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
and it lines all of that line out and
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
then it continues to line out into the f
 
03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
then it continues to line out into the f
there

03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
means that that is the only part of the
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
current law that is taken out
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the way this is written then
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph that used to be f is now
 
03:08:52.469 --> 03:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph e but that's that's the only
 
03:08:54.630 --> 03:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
language that's taken out of the bill as
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
i see it
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
and the rest is the bill right that's a
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
strategy that's used by legislative
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
services when they instead of just
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
completely rewriting the whole thing
 
03:09:06.230 --> 03:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
they take on the first part all they've
 
03:09:08.230 --> 03:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
done is remove part e which is
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
knowingly permits
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
a place under the person's control to be
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
used for in violation of a subparagraph
 
03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's a new paragraph added
 
03:09:19.750 --> 03:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
which is uh on page two starting on line
 
03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:20.790 align:start position:0%
which is uh on page two starting on line
six

03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
six
 
03:09:22.550 --> 03:09:22.560 align:start position:0%

03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i see that thank you very
much

03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:28.229 --> 03:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
03:09:38.389 --> 03:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
any or a large amount of
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement going into our private
 
03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:41.670 align:start position:0%
law enforcement going into our private
homes

03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
homes
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
for this type of an arrest
 
03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
right now i don't know of any the only
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
the only city i know where there was a
 
03:09:51.190 --> 03:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
lot of enforcement of prostitution laws
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
was the city of manchester when i lived
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
there and
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
what they were mainly going after was
 
03:09:57.750 --> 03:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
what was going on on the street i
 
03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
believe they were also going into
 
03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:00.630 align:start position:0%
believe they were also going into
lodging

03:10:00.630 --> 03:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
lodging
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason that they were doing that
 
03:10:03.670 --> 03:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
was only because there was a federal
 
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
grant that said that the city had to
 
03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
spend the money enforcing prostitution
 
03:10:09.510 --> 03:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
laws that was the only one that i was
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%

03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
i saw a hand go up over there i didn't
 
03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
i saw a hand go up over there i didn't

03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
do you mind if i take this down it's a
 
03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
little easier to speak
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%

concern for children and their welfare
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are others here who are testifying
 
03:11:37.269 --> 03:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
today that have much more expertise on
 
03:11:39.750 --> 03:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns result regarding this bill
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
but allow our
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
prostitution to be legalized what i want
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on is the harm to
 
03:11:48.790 --> 03:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
children this bill states that by
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
keeping prostitution illegal we are
 
03:11:54.070 --> 03:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
contributing to the improvisation
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
of single mothers and their children
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
the idea of a single mother having men
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
in her home while her children are there
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
is very dangerous darkness to light is a
 
03:12:06.710 --> 03:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
non-profit whose mission is to end
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse they cite research
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
that children who live in a single
 
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
parent and has a living partner are the
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
highest rate of sexual abuse they are 20
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
times more likely to be victims of
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse than children who live with
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
03:12:21.990 --> 03:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
research fellow jeremy summit cites
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
reviews of more than 70 research reports
 
03:12:26.790 --> 03:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
providing overwhelming evidence that
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
girls living in non-traditional families
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
are sexually abused by step fathers
 
03:12:32.550 --> 03:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
partners of the single remarried or
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
partner mothers at many times
 
03:12:38.309 --> 03:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
the rate abused by a biological father
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
there are men coming into the home who
 
03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
have no connection to the children and
 
03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
are coming only the purpose of sex this
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
i believe can be a dangerous situation
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
for the children
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%

03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
what ace is is adverse childhood
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
experience this has been pretty well
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
accepted at most schools
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
and how we treat children these days
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
what aces is is childhood experience
 
03:13:07.510 --> 03:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
that harms children's developing brains
 
03:13:09.990 --> 03:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
so profoundly that the effects show up
 
03:13:12.309 --> 03:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
decades later they can cut they cause
 
03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
much of the chronic disease mental
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
illness and at the root of most violence
 
03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
this is my greatest concern for these
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
children that in these situations they
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
would experience aces due to these men
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
coming into their home the aces can not
 
03:13:27.269 --> 03:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
only be sexual abuse but hearing yelling
 
03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps violence against her mother and
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
other abuses
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
there are means in which our state and
 
03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
schools help single mothers get the
 
03:13:37.510 --> 03:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
education they need for their families
 
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
they would be much healthier for them
 
03:13:40.630 --> 03:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
and their children
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
this is what we need to be promoting the
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
course i teach human development is a
 
03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
requirement at river valley nursing
 
03:13:49.110 --> 03:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
program a large percentage of my
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
students are single moms i tell them
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
this is the best thing you can do right
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
now for your family
 
03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
these are the things we should be
 
03:13:59.910 --> 03:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
promoting i strongly urge that you do
 
03:14:05.830 --> 03:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.429 --> 03:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you for
 
03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
03:14:38.309 --> 03:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
specifically outlines the quite the
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
experience that i had because it doesn't
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%

i was just turned 14.
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
you hear me right the day before i was
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
13 years old
 
03:15:08.309 --> 03:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half later this same
 
03:15:11.110 --> 03:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
buyer rented an apartment where he had a
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
stable a stable is a term for the for
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
that we use when you have more than one
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
sex trafficked child or
 
03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
persons there were three of us girls at
 
03:15:24.070 --> 03:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
the time when i was living there and he
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
furnished us generously with narcotics
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:34.229 --> 03:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of generosity went on if we were
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
very compliant if we were not we were
 
03:15:39.190 --> 03:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
threatened very seriously not only with
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
violence but with being turned out into
 
03:15:43.349 --> 03:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
the street etc
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a violent experience in that
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
place for me but we did suffer a lot of
 
03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
deprivations if we didn't comply we
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
didn't get any food he would go away on
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
vacation and leave us with nothing we
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to leave or we would not
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
be allowed to come back
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
this situation only again lasted a few
 
03:16:00.479 --> 03:16:01.750 align:start position:0%
this situation only again lasted a few
months

03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
but i was trafficked for four years
 
03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i want to just let you know that
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
because i'm sitting here and i look okay
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
you might think well that was just a
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
childhood experience it's no big deal
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
but i have suffered my entire life with
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
all kinds of symptoms from chronic
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
illness and pain constantly to symptoms
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
similar to post-traumatic stress
 
03:16:26.710 --> 03:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
disorder nightmares inability to make
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
decisions i own nothing because i can't
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
make long-term decisions
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
i have suffered on and off with
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and with alcoholism i
 
03:16:38.229 --> 03:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
have a lot of trauma responses in my
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
life that i manage with a great deal of
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
diligence and a lot of struggle
 
03:16:46.469 --> 03:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
this is not a small thing the
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative introduced this bill
 
03:16:50.070 --> 03:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
saying in one's own home
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
about 15 times
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
but if you look at that bill it says or
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
in a place where they're legally able to
 
03:16:58.479 --> 03:16:59.670 align:start position:0%
in a place where they're legally able to
be

03:16:59.670 --> 03:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's a big difference from in one's
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
own home
 
03:17:05.910 --> 03:17:05.920 align:start position:0%

03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
i like my like my survivor sibling

before me i'm a survivor of sex
trafficking

03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
03:17:58.389 --> 03:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
i was trafficked as a 15 year old child
 
03:18:01.190 --> 03:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
in and out of maine new england
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
all over the place in people's homes
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
i was brought into people's homes so
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
this bill just floors me i can't even
 
03:18:10.229 --> 03:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
i've had three days to kind of process
 
03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
this and i'm shaking
 
03:18:15.030 --> 03:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
like this is insane to me that
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
there are people even considering doing
 
03:18:17.439 --> 03:18:18.950 align:start position:0%
there are people even considering doing
this

03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:20.710 --> 03:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm just gonna continue on with what
 
03:18:22.870 --> 03:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
i have written but
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
i was brought into people's homes
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
i was brought into hotels legally
 
03:18:29.910 --> 03:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
operated strip clubs that are still
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
fully functioning
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
all against my will
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
i did not want to be at any of these
 
03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:36.550 align:start position:0%
i did not want to be at any of these
places

03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
i was told that if i did not go to these
 
03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:39.670 align:start position:0%
i was told that if i did not go to these
places

03:18:39.670 --> 03:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
places
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
that the people who had trafficked me
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
would have my son taken away from me
 
03:18:44.550 --> 03:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
because i had been living on my own
 
03:18:46.389 --> 03:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
since i was 12
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
and living in my own apartment going to
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
school and working and taking care of my
 
03:18:53.110 --> 03:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
son at 14 years old
 
03:18:56.229 --> 03:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
these men knew what my biggest
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
what my biggest fear was and they
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
exploited that they told me that if i
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
did not do everything that they told me
 
03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
to do they would have my son taken away
 
03:19:07.910 --> 03:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
walking alongside survivors of all ages
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
and the long-term impacts
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
like darlene has stated
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that i myself
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
have experienced and the other survivors
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
that i walk alongside
 
03:19:21.359 --> 03:19:22.710 align:start position:0%
that i walk alongside
and

03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:24.550 --> 03:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
just because we are removed from that
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
situation does not mean that it all of a
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
sudden just goes away
 
03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
the long-term impacts of people being
 
03:19:32.389 --> 03:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
trafficked exploited and who have
 
03:19:34.710 --> 03:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
experienced prostitution
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
even if they
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
even if they believe that they have been
 
03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
there as a willing participant
 
03:19:43.349 --> 03:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
these effects still remain
 
03:19:46.469 --> 03:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
some of those are cptsd anxiety
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
struggles with self-worth suicidal
 
03:19:48.880 --> 03:19:50.389 align:start position:0%
struggles with self-worth suicidal
ideation

03:19:50.389 --> 03:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
ideation
 
03:19:50.399 --> 03:19:52.469 align:start position:0%
ideation
suicide

03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
i myself attempted suicide so many times
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't even remember how many
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
the last suicide attempt i had was when
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
i was 23
 
03:20:04.229 --> 03:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i had to learn how to walk again
 
03:20:06.070 --> 03:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
all of this because of the trauma that i
 
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
experienced as a child and my experience
 
03:20:14.790 --> 03:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
legalizing prostitution has never been
 
03:20:18.550 --> 03:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
an effective strategy to keep people
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
safe because there is absolutely no way
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
to know who is there by choice and who
 
03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:24.710 align:start position:0%
to know who is there by choice and who
isn't

03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
how old a person is
 
03:20:29.190 --> 03:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
nobody was asking me to see my state id
 
03:20:31.590 --> 03:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
or to see my birth certificate and i can
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
guarantee you even if they had
 
03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
my trafficker would have found a way to
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
have a fake id made so there is
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely no way to guarantee that
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.750 --> 03:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
and to just kind of
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
03:20:56.309 --> 03:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
03:20:58.550 --> 03:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
somebody stated earlier that it's the
 
03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the person who
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
is selling sex
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
to be tested once a year
 
03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes those tests don't become clear
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
for six months nine months
 
03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.309 align:start position:0%
for six months nine months
sometimes

03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
it just floors me that that was even
 
03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
presented but the thing that floors me
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
most is that what about the men who are
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
coming in to buy or what about the
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
people in general
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
who are there to come in and buy sex
 
03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
what's the responsibility on their end
 
03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to end just by stating that it
 
03:21:36.229 --> 03:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
took me 16 years to even know that there
 
03:21:39.190 --> 03:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
was a name for what happened to me
 
03:21:41.190 --> 03:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that it wasn't my fault
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
i never spoke of what happened to me for
 
03:21:46.710 --> 03:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
16 years i sat in that silence i sat in
 
03:21:48.790 --> 03:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
that pain
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
terrified to go into grocery stores
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
because i might run into somebody who
 
03:21:54.150 --> 03:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
paid for me
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:59.670 --> 03:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's trauma
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
that does not just go away
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
that carries on with people who have
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
stated that they are willing
 
03:22:11.590 --> 03:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to ask you i'm just
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to end on this please
 
03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
please do not let this pass this is not
 
03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
safe it is not a way to help people
 
03:22:22.229 --> 03:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
as much as people
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
can try to claim that it is it just
 
03:22:26.790 --> 03:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
simply is not
 
03:22:28.710 --> 03:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
it took me another year and a half after
 
03:22:30.070 --> 03:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
i learned that there was a name for what
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
happened to me and that it wasn't my
 
03:22:35.190 --> 03:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
fault to say something and since then i
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
have been able to be a fierce advocate
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
and for other people who are still
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
walking through this and for people who
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
remained in their bondage of silence
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
even longer than i did
 
03:22:48.309 --> 03:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
please do not let this pass i will at
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
this point take any questions anybody
 
03:22:50.399 --> 03:22:54.229 align:start position:0%
this point take any questions anybody
has

03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
there been no questions the witnesses
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
the committee calls marissa fulcans
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
hi there thank you for hearing me my
 
03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
name is marissa fernandez i am the
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
national director of new hampshire
 
03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
traffic free coalition
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
i live in new hampshire and i
 
03:23:29.429 --> 03:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak today in opposition to
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
this bill i've been working the
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
anti-trafficking world for 13 years and
 
03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
i'm horrified to see how much this would
 
03:23:41.190 --> 03:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
set us back as a state and as a as a
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
nation if we were to
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
condone a bill like this that has so
 
03:23:48.630 --> 03:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
many things that would harm women inside
 
03:23:50.469 --> 03:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
of it and put them at greater risk of
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.479 --> 03:23:56.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:23:56.070 --> 03:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:59.429 --> 03:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is there's a the
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
london school of economics did a
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
big research paper and they found that
 
03:24:04.399 --> 03:24:05.429 align:start position:0%
big research paper and they found that
wherever

03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
sex was legal the demand for it
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
increased and
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking increased
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a just simple economics where
 
03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
where there is a demand
 
03:24:18.309 --> 03:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
you have to have more product and so
 
03:24:19.510 --> 03:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening when you look at
 
03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
like las vegas or germany certain places
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
in germany and the netherlands
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
um this is a big issue because people
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
know they can go there and buy sex and
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
if you're an entrepreneur or if you know
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
you can um
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
make more money as a result of this
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
situations like darlene's
 
03:24:40.479 --> 03:24:41.349 align:start position:0%
situations like darlene's
um

03:24:41.349 --> 03:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:42.550 --> 03:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
more often because they want to
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
be able to get as much money and have as
 
03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
much product as they possibly can to
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
meet that demand
 
03:24:49.760 --> 03:24:51.030 align:start position:0%
meet that demand
um

03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:53.910 --> 03:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
it also would make new hampshire a sex
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
tourist destination which would put the
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
women that i work with at greater risk
 
03:24:59.429 --> 03:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
and the people we're trying to protect
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
at greater risk
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
um and i also as a mother with three
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
boys i don't want my children growing up
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
thinking they can purchase another human
 
03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:08.469 align:start position:0%
thinking they can purchase another human
being

03:25:08.469 --> 03:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:25:10.630 --> 03:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
for sex and i think it really sets us
 
03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
for sex and i think it really sets us
back

03:25:11.590 --> 03:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:12.630 align:start position:0%
back
um

03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:14.870 --> 03:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a movement like even as from a
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
feminist perspective to think that um
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
women can be bought and sold and that
 
03:25:21.910 --> 03:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're an object to fulfill a specific
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
gratification of another individual so i
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
so some of the other points were made
 
03:25:35.190 --> 03:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i asked for it for two
 
03:25:38.550 --> 03:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
minutes but yes i would just ask you to
 
03:25:40.150 --> 03:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
consider is this something we want in
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
our state is this something that we want
 
03:25:44.550 --> 03:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
to condone we want our
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
young children growing up thinking that
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
especially women can be bought and sold
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
as predominantly women
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
who are
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
in prostitution
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
we need to be creating exit strategies
 
03:25:56.790 --> 03:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is not the best we can do for the
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%

so i won't reiterate who we are
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
but we are strongly opposed to hb 1176
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
which would have an extremely harmful
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
impact on the victims of sexual assault
 
03:26:44.870 --> 03:26:44.880 align:start position:0%

uh there are three main areas that i
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
hope to address in my testimony one is
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
clarification on what the general court
 
03:27:14.550 --> 03:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
finds in this legislation impact that
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
this legislation will have on victims of
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and human trafficking
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
based on the experiences they have now
 
03:27:22.710 --> 03:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
and the illumination of the
 
03:27:24.309 --> 03:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive health care needs victims
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault and human trafficking
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
have as it relates to the risk and
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
prevention of sexually transmitted
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
first

03:27:33.590 --> 03:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
from a medical perspective the article
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
that was listed which references
 
03:27:40.229 --> 03:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
researchers at ucla and baylor
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
university who discover a reduction in
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
rape and stis during a time when indoor
 
03:27:46.870 --> 03:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
prostitution was inadvertently
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
decriminalized in rhode island
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
i've included that article for your
 
03:27:51.359 --> 03:27:52.710 align:start position:0%
i've included that article for your
reference

03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
reference
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
from a medical perspective it's really
 
03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
important to note that this paper has
 
03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
not been peer reviewed but rather
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
circulated for discussion and comment
 
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
purposes only
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
in addition the authors clearly state
 
03:28:05.990 --> 03:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
quote we are not claiming to have
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
identified the casual channels which
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
link decriminalization unquote
 
03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
to the reducti rejections that they
 
03:28:12.319 --> 03:28:14.389 align:start position:0%
to the reducti rejections that they
discuss

03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
second i'd like to address the
 
03:28:17.990 --> 03:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion that uh criminal
 
03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:19.110 align:start position:0%
suggestion that uh criminal
criminal

03:28:19.110 --> 03:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
offense of sex work is leading to the
 
03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic of sexual violence
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
sexual violence including human
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
trafficking occurs across all
 
03:28:28.630 --> 03:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic populations regardless of
 
03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
an individual's choice of employment it
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
is forced manipulated or coerced sexual
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
activity in which the perpetrator uses
 
03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
sex to inflict humiliation exert power
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
and control or use the victim to attain
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
sexual gratification without regard to
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
the victim's consent
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for that sexual
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
violence lies squarely at the feet of
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
the offenders who are rarely if ever
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
held accountable holding offenders
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
accountable by legalizing their activity
 
03:28:56.469 --> 03:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
is unfathomable and extremely dangerous
 
03:28:57.910 --> 03:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
to further suggest that in holding
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
offenders accountable we are in some way
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
contributing to the rate of sexual
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
violence it's outrageous it minimizes
 
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
the very real abusive and traumatizing
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
experience that victims of human
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
trafficking and sexual assault face
 
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
the impact the second area would be the
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
impact of this legislation on victims of
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and human trafficking
 
03:29:18.950 --> 03:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
based on the experiences they have now
 
03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
i know that members of the human
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking task force are here today to
 
03:29:23.349 --> 03:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
address the significant concerns that
 
03:29:25.510 --> 03:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
arise from this legislation but i'd like
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to just highlight a couple
 
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
from someone who frequently provides
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
care to those
 
03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
patients experiencing sexual assault and
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
human trafficking
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
with treatment and care okay
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
sexual assault including human
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
trafficking is already severely unre
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
under reported and there are significant
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
bias and victim blaming when the adult
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
sex worker reports
 
03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
03:29:49.190 --> 03:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
which contributes to no reporting or
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
under reporting of this crime when it
 
03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
does occur
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
when victims feel it is unsafe to report
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
not only are offenders not held
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
accountable but the victims themselves
 
03:29:59.110 --> 03:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
do not get the access to treatment and
 
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
resources that they need
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
this bill will actually place victims at
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
more risk because it will reduce their
 
03:30:06.150 --> 03:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
access to critical protections and
 
03:30:06.160 --> 03:30:07.990 align:start position:0%
access to critical protections and
support

03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:30:09.510 --> 03:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
many victims of human trafficking are
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
not identified at all due to the lack of
 
03:30:12.870 --> 03:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
education and understanding about the
 
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
differences between trafficking and
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
prostitution this legislation will
 
03:30:18.790 --> 03:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
assist in making it more difficult to
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
identify the victims of trafficking
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
i routinely care for children and adults
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
who are forced or coerced into providing
 
03:30:27.269 --> 03:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
sex whether it be for money food shelter
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
or something else
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation increases the
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
likelihood that those individuals will
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
be harder to find identify and properly
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
care for
 
03:30:38.229 --> 03:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
the third area illumination of the
 
03:30:39.670 --> 03:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive healthcare needs for
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual assault and human
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking as it relates to the risk
 
03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
and prevention of sexually transmitted
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%

03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
victims of violence and victims of human
 
03:30:48.800 --> 03:30:50.150 align:start position:0%

present for health care in similar ways
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
but victims of human trafficking are
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
more likely to be isolated
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%

03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
victims of human trafficking need timely
 
03:31:24.550 --> 03:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
access to health care and treatment that
 
03:31:26.469 --> 03:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
is comprehensive and reflective of their

they face
 
03:31:30.790 --> 03:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
providing this essential care would be
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible under this new
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
legislation which will only increase the

the care and support they critically
 
03:31:37.439 --> 03:31:38.469 align:start position:0%
the care and support they critically
need

03:31:38.469 --> 03:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
it is also in the best interest of the
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
state and its citizens to implement
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
public policy that serves to improve the
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances of sexual assault and
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%

03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
we should be putting forth every effort
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
to address the root cause of violence
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
not create further opportunities for
 
03:31:56.870 --> 03:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
abuse and exploitation
 
03:31:58.710 --> 03:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
in conclusion the realities of sexual
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
assault and human trafficking new
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire have far-reaching consequences
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
for victims in the communities which
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
they live
 
03:32:06.870 --> 03:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
victims often experience a lifetime of
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
trauma including both acute and chronic
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health consequences
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the coalition and the sane program
 
03:32:15.190 --> 03:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
believe this legislation will cause
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
greater difficulty and identification of
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
victims and further harm
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
by limiting health care ability to
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
there being no questions the witnesses
 
03:32:32.790 --> 03:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:34.830 --> 03:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
we now call charles
 
03:32:50.790 --> 03:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair and members of
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is charles
 
03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
pendlebury i've been in law enforcement
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
for 10 years two of which i've served on
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire human trafficking task
 
03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
force i am here speaking as a
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative of the merrimack county
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office in opposition to hb
 
03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:12.950 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office in opposition to hb

03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
1176
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
which would be detrimental to the safety
 
03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
of human trafficking victims
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
i would like to briefly share a few
 
03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
facts that we know to be true from our
 
03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
experience to investigate and charge
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
identifying sex trafficking is extremely
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
difficult because of tactics used by
 
03:33:35.920 --> 03:33:37.429 align:start position:0%
difficult because of tactics used by
traffickers

03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
traffickers
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
this bill would further complicate
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
efforts to come to combat sex
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
trafficking specifically law enforcement
 
03:33:47.349 --> 03:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
officers would now lack probable cause
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
to enter a home or building under this
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
new law
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
as the bill essentially legalizes
 
03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
brothels without any protections for
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
victims of human trafficking
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
traffickers are known to use violence
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
and intimidation to force their victims
 
03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
into commercial sex
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
they further brainwash their victims to
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
believe that police cannot be trusted
 
03:34:15.110 --> 03:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
and are only there to wreck their lives
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking victims struggle to
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
identify their own victimization
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is a crime that is happening in the
 
03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:23.910 align:start position:0%
this is a crime that is happening in the
shadows

03:34:23.910 --> 03:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
shadows
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
victims are not reporting this crime
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
because they are under a delusion
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
created by the trafficker
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
that what they are doing is at their own
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
free will
 
03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
sex traffickers will use this
 
03:34:38.950 --> 03:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislation to convince their victims
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
that this activity is legal this will
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
only embolden the traffickers
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
to increase their ability to control the
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
activities of their victims
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
i can honestly say that i've never
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
arrested anyone in my time as a law
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
03:34:59.190 --> 03:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
for prostitution and currently it is not
 
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
a common practice in new hampshire for
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
sex workers to be prosecuted and in some
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
counties there have been less than five
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
cases in the last three years
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
even if a sex worker is arrested it is
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely that they will be
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
convicted of the crime often due to
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
later correctly being identified as a
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
victim of human trafficking
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
with that in mind it is very confusing
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
to me as to who we are actually trying
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
to protect with this legislation
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
additionally monitoring the crime of
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
human trafficking is already extremely
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
difficult and this legislation will make
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
it nearly impossible
 
03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to briefly talk about
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
familiar trafficking which to me is
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
up there is one of the most horrendous
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
forms of this crime
 
03:35:45.680 --> 03:35:46.630 align:start position:0%
forms of this crime
where

03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
parents and guardians
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
will often trade their child
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
or person they are in custodial care of
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
to fuel a substance abuse addiction or
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
something like that and to me if this is
 
03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:01.990 align:start position:0%
something like that and to me if this is
passed

03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:36:04.710 --> 03:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
it will only embolden them and make them
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
feel they can do whatever they want in
 
03:36:08.469 --> 03:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
their home or place they have legal
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
right with no repercussions
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
i appreciate your time and i can answer
 
03:36:15.590 --> 03:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:19.190 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
have

03:36:19.190 --> 03:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:20.710 --> 03:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you for
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
hello i'm michael shively i'm
 
03:36:39.590 --> 03:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
representing the national center on
 
03:36:41.990 --> 03:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
sexual exploitation
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
i'm a career researcher and most of it
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
is applied research in the fields of
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and victims issues
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to mostly restrict what i
 
03:36:55.110 --> 03:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
say to the factual foundation that was
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
put forward in this bill
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
there's so many things wrong with it
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of hard to know where to
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
start and we'd be here all day if i just
 
03:37:04.710 --> 03:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
fact checked everything in it but i'm
 
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
more than happy to provide information
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
like the details later but
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'll just touch over the kind of the low
 
03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
lights of what's presented and just
 
03:37:15.910 --> 03:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
offer some you know counter facts or a
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of reality check on it
 
03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
um before i get into that though just a
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
little perspective that i can't help but
 
03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
little perspective that i can't help but
thinking

03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
i just can't help but think of
 
03:37:28.469 --> 03:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that long ago when domestic
 
03:37:30.630 --> 03:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
violence was considered a family matter
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's something it's in the home it's
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
their business the state has no business
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
wading into homes and
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
worrying about what's going on there
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
this just seems like we're we're headed
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
back you know it seems like you're
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
taking what is undoubtedly the most
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous way to make money that exists
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
on the planet
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
the evidence is absolutely overwhelming
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
that nothing is more dangerous than
 
03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
commercial sex
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter what legal system
 
03:38:03.190 --> 03:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
it operates under it's always dangerous
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
and it's endemic and you can't do harm
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
reduction it just it doesn't get reduced
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
right it if it exists it's dangerous now
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying let's take this insanely
 
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous thing
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's private business as long
 
03:38:21.190 --> 03:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
as it's indoors
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's like saying you know like all
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
this family stuff we we can't sort it
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
out so just let it go right
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the perspective but
 
03:38:31.520 --> 03:38:32.550 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the perspective but
um

03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of research on this in
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
fact there are over 700 000 studies and
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
factual reports about it so it's
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
possible to come out of that
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
avalanche of facts and reports and come
 
03:38:47.910 --> 03:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
up with anything you know i can support
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
any conclusion about it if what you do
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
is cherry pick just the stuff you want
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
which is what's happened this this reads
 
03:38:58.269 --> 03:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
directly it's from the playbook of the
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
pro-decriminalization movement which is
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
a global movement and actually in that
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
movement new hampshire is just a point
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
on a map
 
03:39:07.910 --> 03:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
and you're targeted you're being
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
targeted with disinformation and this
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
factual foundation that's in there it's
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's directly from the documentation
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know going back to the tobacco
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
industry and if the only thing you
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
listened to was what the tobacco
 
03:39:25.990 --> 03:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
industry said about smoking safety
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's what you have in front of you so
 
03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
um i i really can't fact-check all of it
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
but basically everything there if their
 
03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
grains of truth but they're
 
03:39:35.359 --> 03:39:36.710 align:start position:0%
grains of truth but they're
misrepresented

03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
misrepresented
 
03:39:39.030 --> 03:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
or they're part of a spectrum of
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
information and it's only one part and
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing the rest of it i'll
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
get into a couple of things but
 
03:39:48.389 --> 03:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that hiv declines
 
03:39:50.710 --> 03:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
under decriminalization there's only one
 
03:39:52.710 --> 03:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
decriminalized country in the in the
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
world it's new zealand right so what are
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
you going to compare to that to right
 
03:39:59.670 --> 03:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's just no comps there there's some
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
estimates but they're really uh
 
03:40:05.590 --> 03:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
problematic and they're very speculative
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
legalization has not worked in the
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
netherlands in fact the netherlands has
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
been kicking it around and they finally
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
recently decided in amsterdam
 
03:40:17.910 --> 03:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
we need it out of the city we've not
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
been able to make this work and they're
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
pushing it out of the city finally um i
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
can talk about nevada i can talk about
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere it's been legalized that's not
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here exactly
 
03:40:30.389 --> 03:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
this is decriminalization which is kind
 
03:40:32.389 --> 03:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the worst of all worlds you're not
 
03:40:34.790 --> 03:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
setting up any real protections or
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
systems to try to make it safe
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
but you're also saying law enforcement
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
is not going to intervene one thing i
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
can guarantee you is that
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
if you decriminalize even if it's just
 
03:40:49.830 --> 03:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
within this limited context of the home
 
03:40:53.349 --> 03:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
you lose police lose probable cause to
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
investigate human trafficking new
 
03:40:58.389 --> 03:40:58.399 align:start position:0%
zealand which is held up by some some
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
success story they just got knocked down
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the state department from a tier one
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
which means the best to a tier 2 country
 
03:41:08.790 --> 03:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
because they don't make sex trafficking
 
03:41:10.469 --> 03:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
cases anymore
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
any advocates groups tells you there are
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
hundreds of child sex trafficking
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
victims in the country
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
they've made zero
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
zero convictions and i identified zero
 
03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
adult or child victims in the last three
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
years these are state department reports
 
03:41:28.080 --> 03:41:29.110 align:start position:0%
years these are state department reports
um

03:41:29.110 --> 03:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
the typical sex trafficking case is made
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
because you see prostitution there's
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
probable cause since it's a crime and
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's when they find out you know she
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
looks 20 but she's 14. or well it seems
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
consensual but as soon as she's away
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
from her pimp she says i this is this is
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
not consensual
 
03:41:51.030 --> 03:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
you lose that um
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
one i'll just talk about one study and
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
then i'll stop that rhode island study
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned earlier
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
here's what happened with that study
 
03:42:00.070 --> 03:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
rhode island
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
they had this weird little loophole that
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
kind of decriminalized it it started in
 
03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
1980 it ended in 2009 what the study did
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
is they looked at these trend lines on
 
03:42:13.990 --> 03:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
health indicators like h
 
03:42:15.189 --> 03:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted diseases they
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
looked at rape rates
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
and they picked the year
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
on sexual assault that was an anomaly it
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
was 49 higher than the previous year the
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
one that came after it
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
they picked 2003
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then they ended it in 2009. well if
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
you take this freak year
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's high and then say something
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
happened and it ended up lower it makes
 
03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
it sound like it went down right
 
03:42:44.550 --> 03:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
the whole trend line tells exactly the
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
opposite story so they took out of um
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
29 years time series they took their
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
favorite six years that's what the study
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
is based on
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of really horrible
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
research and then there's some good
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
facts that actually were good research
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
but if you misrepresent them they tell
 
03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
the story that really isn't the true
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
story so um
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm more than happy i've got i could
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
give you more research than you would
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
ever care to look at and i could support
 
03:43:15.510 --> 03:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
anything i've said and i'm happy to go
 
03:43:18.630 --> 03:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
point by point in that factual statement
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
and offer at least another perspective
 
03:43:28.309 --> 03:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:33.429 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
you know i i wouldn't want you to have
 
03:43:36.309 --> 03:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
to go by
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
point by point
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
but i'm just curious if your research
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
has any
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
anything you could say from your
 
03:43:46.070 --> 03:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
research that deals with uh
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two which is about the
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
harmful reduction countries i don't know
 
03:43:51.910 --> 03:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
what that is
 
03:43:53.590 --> 03:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
that and also roman numeral six
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
which just mentions article 2b of the
 
03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution i would be
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
interested in anything that your
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
research showed about or you could say
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
based on your research
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's a
 
03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
a trend or a movement in the public
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
health field where um
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh for for reasons i could talk about
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
but it could take too much time
 
03:44:25.670 --> 03:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
unless you want to um
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's a movement to to accept
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
decriminalization and it's mostly driven
 
03:44:31.349 --> 03:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
by the industry itself and the industry
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
itself of course their economic
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
interests are to make more money and
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
keep the industry flourishing so
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
um in the public health world there
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
there's some adoption of this
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
decriminalization idea
 
03:44:44.950 --> 03:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of studies that they
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
all look the same pretty much which is
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
what they do is they go into a clinic
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
and they find that um you know there's
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
astronomical rates of all kinds of
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
horrible things for anyone involved in
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
the sex trade
 
03:44:56.880 --> 03:44:57.670 align:start position:0%
the sex trade
and

03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
then there's an assertion in the study
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
that says
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
it would be great if it was
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
decriminalized right that way the police
 
03:45:05.030 --> 03:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't harass people
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
so there's an assertion in there but
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's really no connection between
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
lowering hiv rates or any other health
 
03:45:11.840 --> 03:45:13.189 align:start position:0%
lowering hiv rates or any other health
problem

03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:45:15.429 --> 03:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
other than that assertion
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's one study by kate shannon showed
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
up in the lancet super famous very
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
widely cited
 
03:45:24.150 --> 03:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
and they said they did an estimate
 
03:45:25.750 --> 03:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's based on very complicated
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
statistical models
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
and i actually had a conversation with
 
03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
the authors and i said was there any
 
03:45:35.590 --> 03:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
data actual data in your models
 
03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
that showed decriminalization i wonder
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
how you measure that do you take all the
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
criminalized and the decriminalized
 
03:45:42.150 --> 03:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
countries you know i mean there's things
 
03:45:44.710 --> 03:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
that i wonder about they said no
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
they had no data on decriminalization
 
03:45:48.150 --> 03:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
what they did is they plugged in
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
assumptions and the assumptions used in
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
that study one
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
economy used to go to 100
 
03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
violence against anyone in sex work
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's their phrase not mine goes to
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
zero percent zero percent police
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
harassment now
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
what in the world could possibly make
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
those things happen no no population of
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
any kind has a zero percent violence
 
03:46:12.550 --> 03:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
rate but they say decriminalization
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
would produce that then with that
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
assumption they plug it into this
 
03:46:18.150 --> 03:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
forecast model
 
03:46:19.990 --> 03:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know so i mean if you really dig
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
under the hood there's just there really
 
03:46:24.150 --> 03:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
is nothing like i i thought about giving
 
03:46:26.550 --> 03:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
you kind of a glib answer at first
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
when he said what's that about and to
 
03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
tell you truth i don't know you know i
 
03:46:32.070 --> 03:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
really can't because there is no
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
evidence that
 
03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
holds up that really substantiates that
 
03:46:40.710 --> 03:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:40.720 --> 03:46:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
the other the other point was do you
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
have anything to say about article 2a of
 
03:46:48.070 --> 03:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution if that
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
relates to this in any way i i i can't
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
say i don't i don't know the new
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution thank you very
 
03:46:57.030 --> 03:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
much for that thank you
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you there be
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls caitlyn makus
 
03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:18.469 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls caitlyn makus
macias

03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is caitlin macias
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm here representing world without
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
exploitation we are the largest
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
anti-human trafficking coalition with
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
over 200 united states-based
 
03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:31.030 align:start position:0%
over 200 united states-based
organizations

03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
and we work on creating a world that's
 
03:47:35.429 --> 03:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
free from human trafficking and sexual
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
exploitation which we believe is a human
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
rights issue that's fueled by gender
 
03:47:42.870 --> 03:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
racial and income inequalities
 
03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
we are guided by survivors of the
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
commercial sex trade whose perspectives
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
are critical in developing just an
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
effective policies
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
i come to this work with a unique
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
perspective i work with world we but i'm
 
03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
also a latinx woman and a student at the
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
columbia school of social work
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
i stand here in opposition or actually
 
03:48:03.229 --> 03:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
sit here in opposition of
 
03:48:03.239 --> 03:48:04.790 align:start position:0%
sit here in opposition of
hb1176

03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
hb1176
 
03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that would remove
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for indoor
 
03:48:08.319 --> 03:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for indoor
prostitution

03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
prostitution
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
this bill and the ideology it represents
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
is a fundamental misunderstanding of the
 
03:48:17.670 --> 03:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
realities of the sex trade and minimizes
 
03:48:20.070 --> 03:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
the lived experiences of survivors of
 
03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
commercial sexual exploitation it's
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
thoughtless to implement a policy that
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
encourages the sex trade to actually
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
expand during a global pandemic
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
this bill claims to actually help women
 
03:48:32.630 --> 03:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
and children
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
and members of the lgbtq community
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
however repealing criminal laws that
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit operating premises for
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
prostitution or operating a brothel will
 
03:48:44.229 --> 03:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
only put those communities in further
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
harm's way you will actually be giving
 
03:48:48.870 --> 03:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
pimps and traffickers a playground to
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
exploit people
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
why do you want a violent industry like
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
the sex trade to actually expand
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
do you know the realities
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
prostitution and sex trafficking are
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
actually inextricably linked and fueled
 
03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
by the demand for commercial sex
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
violence is actually incredibly
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
pervasive physical psychological and
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse that you've actually
 
03:49:13.030 --> 03:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
heard from survivors today
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
even in the privacy of their own homes
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
indoor prostitution is dangerous no one
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
will be able to see inside these homes
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
the best example of why new hampshire
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
should not pass this bill is actually
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
rhode island and you've heard about this
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
today rhode island decriminalized indoor
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
prostitution between 1980 and 2009 as a
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
result the stand became
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
a regional sex tourism hub with high
 
03:49:38.790 --> 03:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
rates of sex trafficking violence and
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
extensive criminal involvement promoting
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state to revert back and adopt
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
strict laws against the
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
sex trade in 2009
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
so by removing these types of penalties
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not protecting
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
marginalized people in the sex trade you
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
will simply be making it easier for
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
someone to start an elicit massage
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
business or brothel in this state
 
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
without worrying about penalties
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so now you're asking me what is the
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
solution we must take a holistic
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
approach instead world we and our member
 
03:50:10.150 --> 03:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
organizations support legislation that
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
specifically ensures that people in
 
03:50:13.910 --> 03:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
prostitution do not face criminal
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
penalties but instead are provided exit
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
strategies and services like safe
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
housing and health care this is known as
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
the equality model
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
we also support policies that enable
 
03:50:25.830 --> 03:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
people in the sex trade to report
 
03:50:27.189 --> 03:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
violence and other crimes they have
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
experienced to law enforcement without
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
fear of arrest
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
we know that criminalizing those engaged
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the sex trade who are victims of
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
violence and exploitation is harmful and
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
does nothing to prevent human
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking and exploitation but we also
 
03:50:44.309 --> 03:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
know that making it easier and less
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
risky for third party exploiters like
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
pimps and brothel owners to prop it off
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
of exploitation of others is actually
 
03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
not the answer
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
please oppose

04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
this bill puts so many people's lives in
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
danger it um it's an insult to so many
 
04:46:50.878 --> 04:46:53.750 align:start position:0%
danger it um it's an insult to so many
different

04:46:53.750 --> 04:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%

04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
speak to another member's motivations
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
behind filing a bill
 
04:47:00.638 --> 04:47:01.590 align:start position:0%
behind filing a bill
so

04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
such um an argument would be
 
04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate however
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
i i think the unintended consequences
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps are some of the consequences of
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
the bill you can speak of if it were to
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
pass the unintended consequences of this
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
put so many people's lives in danger
 
04:47:17.440 --> 04:47:18.310 align:start position:0%
put so many people's lives in danger
um

04:47:18.310 --> 04:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
and also i want to for the record say
 
04:47:21.520 --> 04:47:23.750 align:start position:0%
and also i want to for the record say
that

04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking is horrible
 
04:47:26.400 --> 04:47:28.788 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking is horrible
and

04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
people that are forced and taken and
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
forced into
 
04:47:33.120 --> 04:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
forced into
uh

04:47:34.390 --> 04:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:47:37.510 --> 04:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of situation it's abhorrent
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
and we should take it serious
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
um but there's a difference between
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking
 
04:47:44.798 --> 04:47:45.590 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking
and

04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
um sex work
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
and people that are professionals
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
and they give consent
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
and we have to be careful about how we
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
talk about things like this because
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're discriminating against an entire
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%

04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court has
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
determined that the senate marijuana
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
alone is not sufficient
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
this was decided as a result of
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
decriminalization as well as the
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
creation of medical cannabis programs in
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
our state literally the smell of
 
04:51:01.030 --> 04:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana is not evidence of a crime
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
because it's not a crime in all cases
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
even though the supreme court has sorted
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
this out for us as a legislature we
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
can't rely on case law alone to maintain
 
04:51:10.628 --> 04:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
law order
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
i put in this bill because i've learned
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
in my life that many things smell like
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana which are not illegal and are
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
not evidence of a crime
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
for example i learned last summer that
 
04:51:21.670 --> 04:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
fresh green branches of maple
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
smell identical to marijuana when burned
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
skunk spray is often mistaken for
 
04:51:28.948 --> 04:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
marijuana as well as the popular
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
oil-based fragrance known as patchouli
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
which can be found in many shampoos
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
soaps and body washes
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
i've also had many experiences in which
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
the smell of marijuana entered my
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle or my home due to the activity
 
04:51:42.550 --> 04:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
of a person nearby but unknown to me
 
04:51:44.550 --> 04:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
for example i've driven behind many
 
04:51:44.560 --> 04:51:45.990 align:start position:0%
for example i've driven behind many
vehicles

04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
in my lifetime that were driven by
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
someone partaking
 
04:51:51.280 --> 04:51:52.390 align:start position:0%
someone partaking
and

04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
the smell exited their vehicle and went
 
04:51:55.910 --> 04:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
into mine my windows were down or my
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:58.798 --> 04:51:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
additionally

04:51:59.910 --> 04:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
i've had a neighbor who would use
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the backyard
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
and we kept our windows open because the
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
weather was nice but we'd have to close
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
them when the neighbors started because
 
04:52:14.708 --> 04:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
and that's a nuisance in and of itself
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
having to close the windows on a nice
 
04:52:18.718 --> 04:52:19.590 align:start position:0%
having to close the windows on a nice
day

04:52:19.590 --> 04:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
but it would be a much greater bother if
 
04:52:22.628 --> 04:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
someone else's behavior was used as
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
grounds to enter my property
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
however all of these circumstances aside
 
04:52:29.030 --> 04:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
i want to return to the new hampshire
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
supreme court case law
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
we can ensure law and order in this
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
state by relying on case law the courts
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
do not make law they interpret it
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
we need to formalize this in statute we
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that people who are not
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
engaging in illegal behavior and cannot
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
reasonably be suspected of such are
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
secure in their persons houses papers
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
and effects against unreasonable
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
searches and seizures
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative testament
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
do you mean to
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me you mean to
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
forbid the use of the smell of
 
04:53:08.958 --> 04:53:10.310 align:start position:0%
forbid the use of the smell of
marijuana

04:53:10.310 --> 04:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
as one of the parts of probable cause in

other words
 
04:53:15.680 --> 04:53:16.788 align:start position:0%
other words
certainly

04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
a person
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
a policeman could uh use marijuana plus
 
04:53:22.240 --> 04:53:22.948 align:start position:0%

marijuana cigarette or something else
 
04:53:30.390 --> 04:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a totality of all the
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
issues all of the
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that are there can you would
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
that be okay
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think you're referring to the
 
04:53:41.910 --> 04:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
decision and
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
um that is the intent is to reflect what
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
the supreme court's decided
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
which is that it
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you chairman
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
what i'm not following in the in the
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
writing on the bill
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
is you say
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
after section 10
 
04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
it must have been some new law that came
 
04:54:25.600 --> 04:54:26.310 align:start position:0%
it must have been some new law that came
in

04:54:26.310 --> 04:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been printed into a book is
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.990 --> 04:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:51.670 --> 04:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
so it says rsa 595a after section 10.
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we look up new hampshire rsa
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.958 --> 04:55:02.868 align:start position:0%
 
595a

04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
595a
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.840 --> 04:55:08.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:55:08.670 --> 04:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
595a has 10 sections so after section 10
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
so it would be section um
 
04:55:15.040 --> 04:55:16.628 align:start position:0%
so it would be section um
11

04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
11
 
04:55:16.638 --> 04:55:17.350 align:start position:0%
11
or

04:55:17.350 --> 04:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
yup and that's what it says in the first
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
line 595-8 colon 11 that's what it would
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
be called
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
would you like would you like to see the
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
rsas well that's fine
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
the witness and the in the members to
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
suspend for a moment
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
the witness is a member of the committee
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
so this discussion is more appropriate
 
04:55:47.190 --> 04:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.200 --> 04:55:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.350 --> 04:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:55:58.868 --> 04:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative would you believe that in
 
04:55:58.878 --> 04:56:00.390 align:start position:0%
representative would you believe that in
1982

04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
1982
 
04:56:03.030 --> 04:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
i got pulled over by a police officer my
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
car was searched
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
on the the suspicion of marijuana
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
because he this officer detected a scent
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be a pinhole leak in my
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
radiator hose and the smell of burning
 
04:56:16.560 --> 04:56:17.990 align:start position:0%
radiator hose and the smell of burning
antifreeze

04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
antifreeze
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
is very similar to
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
to cannabis so um in addition to those
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
examples you cited
 
04:56:27.990 --> 04:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
did you would you believe that would you
 
04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
believe that antifreeze is the same
 
04:56:36.628 --> 04:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.550 --> 04:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:41.910 --> 04:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
is the question that do you believe the
 
04:56:44.628 --> 04:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
smell of burning antifreeze
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
is i think she was asking if i believe
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
that if that occurred and i don't
 
04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
remember if you said the 70s but if it's
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
the 70s i might have my doubts okay
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you any additional
 
04:56:54.400 --> 04:56:55.510 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you any additional
questions

04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
i asked karen to print it a little bit
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
ago i think she'll bring it in soon um
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
or she'll ask me to come get it and i'll
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
hand it to you
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
into the chairman inquire of one
 
04:57:09.440 --> 04:57:10.470 align:start position:0%
into the chairman inquire of one
question

04:57:10.470 --> 04:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
is this intent it says an officer shall
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
not use the scent of marijuana's
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
do you are you suggesting just the scent
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
alone would not establish probable cause
 
04:57:21.440 --> 04:57:22.310 align:start position:0%
alone would not establish probable cause
or

04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
it can't be considered as part of our
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
totality with other considerations
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
um i think that i already answered that
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
question earlier
 
04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
with representative testerman
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
alone i apologize if i okay thank you if
 
04:57:38.550 --> 04:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
i missed the answer i do apologize to
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.788 --> 04:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative testman you are
 
04:57:51.840 --> 04:57:54.230 align:start position:0%
representative testman you are
recognized

04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
when you stated
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
that it
 
04:57:59.670 --> 04:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't be used alone and consistent
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the supreme court decision
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
if you read regardless of that if you
 
04:58:04.400 --> 04:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
if you read regardless of that if you
read

04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:58:05.440 --> 04:58:06.948 align:start position:0%
read
what

04:58:06.948 --> 04:58:06.958 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative abbas was saying
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
it says you shall not use the senate of
 
04:58:13.990 --> 04:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana as probable cause that would
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
that you could not use it at all not if
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's not part of something else but you
 
04:58:21.680 --> 04:58:22.708 align:start position:0%
it's not part of something else but you
know

04:58:22.708 --> 04:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:58:24.550 --> 04:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
i do you
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
what do you mean there i mean i know
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
what your bill says but what you said
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
my question is he said what do you mean
 
04:58:42.310 --> 04:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
i think i think i answered that in your
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
earlier question um the scent of
 
04:58:46.390 --> 04:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana alone should not be probable
 
04:58:46.400 --> 04:58:47.270 align:start position:0%
marijuana alone should not be probable
cause

04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
cause
 
04:58:50.948 --> 04:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:52.390 --> 04:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
which is what our house smells like
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes my question
 
04:59:00.788 --> 04:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.878 --> 04:59:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:59:08.628 --> 04:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
i believe that the bill says that um
 
04:59:11.190 --> 04:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
because it says as probable cause to
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
conduct a search and it doesn't say um
 
04:59:17.270 --> 04:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
alone but it doesn't say in addition to
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything else so i think that that is
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
the intent is clear to me
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
i know that my communications with ols
 
04:59:26.390 --> 04:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
my intent was clear
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
the committee calls the honorable jess
 
04:59:33.440 --> 04:59:45.190 align:start position:0%
the committee calls the honorable jess
edwards

04:59:45.190 --> 04:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the record i'm
 
04:59:48.868 --> 04:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards uh
 
04:59:51.910 --> 04:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
representing auburn chester and sandown
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
i signed in in opposition to this bill
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
i've already learned something though i
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that there was a supreme
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
court case that spoke to this matter
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would
 
05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
still be tempted to go one of two
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
directions that's different than this
 
05:00:08.080 --> 05:00:08.948 align:start position:0%
directions that's different than this
bill

05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:00:10.868 --> 05:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
i would either not
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
pass this into the rsas because the
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision is already in
 
05:00:15.200 --> 05:00:16.230 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision is already in
effect

05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
effect
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
and the court can modify and tweak it
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
you know according to
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
future cases
 
05:00:23.120 --> 05:00:24.070 align:start position:0%
future cases
or

05:00:24.070 --> 05:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:00:26.708 --> 05:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
i would go ahead and amend it
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
so that the word
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
solely is inserted in an appropriate
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
spot to make grammatical sense
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
so that it's clear that the smell alone
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
or solely the smell
 
05:00:39.360 --> 05:00:40.230 align:start position:0%
or solely the smell
um

05:00:40.230 --> 05:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
would not be on its own uh probable
 
05:00:45.670 --> 05:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
cause so i think i i
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
listen to the conversation i just think
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
a simple word tweak could fix it
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i guess i just would also
 
05:00:54.390 --> 05:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
since this is a criminal justice
 
05:00:54.400 --> 05:00:55.430 align:start position:0%
since this is a criminal justice
committee

05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
i just say i really
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
am concerned
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
about the national trend
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
in disrespecting
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and removing
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
powers from them and
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
sends a it sends a bad message i think
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
it makes it harder for them to do their
 
05:01:13.760 --> 05:01:15.350 align:start position:0%
it makes it harder for them to do their
job

05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we need to
 
05:01:19.030 --> 05:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
hire good people we need to train them
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
very well we need to supervise them well
 
05:01:23.750 --> 05:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
but generally i i think we need to
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
accept that they have a vital role in
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
public safety so
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'll answer questions if there are
 
05:01:29.920 --> 05:01:31.670 align:start position:0%
uh i'll answer questions if there are
any

05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
the representative is excused
 
05:01:39.750 --> 05:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls lieutenant bill
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and thank you for hearing
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
my testimony committee for the record my
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
name is lieutenant bill bright of the
 
05:01:54.550 --> 05:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state police i oversee the
 
05:01:57.110 --> 05:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
narcotics investigations unit for
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police um my
 
05:02:01.110 --> 05:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
concern a few of my concerns have
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
already been talked about uh
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the previous testimony
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
um you know our concerns are that i mean
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that says
 
05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
used to be used as a sole source um the
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
order of marijuana is very distinct and
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
can be used as a contributing factor in
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
many many cases
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
cases where there
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
are other
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
other factors that are going into the
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
establishment of probable cause
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
and this would add to those factors and
 
05:02:32.240 --> 05:02:33.270 align:start position:0%
and this would add to those factors and
strengthen

05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
strengthen
 
05:02:35.350 --> 05:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
a police officer's case so
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i have concerns about
 
05:02:39.750 --> 05:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
about this bill so i'm willing to take
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question the the
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
scent of marijuana is that
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
having smoked it or is it the
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
weed itself
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
i have no
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
conception of exactly what we're talking
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
about here well i think that there's uh
 
05:03:04.470 --> 05:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know oftentimes there's the the
 
05:03:07.110 --> 05:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
order of fresh marijuana and the odor of
 
05:03:08.948 --> 05:03:08.958 align:start position:0%
burnt marijuana
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
and as
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned they can at times
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
smell other things can smell the same
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
but when it's used as a contributing
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
factor along with
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
other factors whether that's other
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
evidence that can be seen or you know
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
heard or intelligence that's known
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
this could be
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
something that an officer can use to
 
05:03:30.550 --> 05:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
establish probable cause and the way the
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill is written it doesn't appear that
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:36.240 --> 05:03:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
welch

05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
welch
 
05:03:40.628 --> 05:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
how does this apply to the drugs
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
smelling the marijuana
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh that is a good question and i don't
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
know how this bill
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
would apply to that
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
but you are correct that a
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
a police canine
 
05:03:55.510 --> 05:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
does detect
 
05:03:55.520 --> 05:04:01.750 align:start position:0%
does detect
odors

05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative calmly
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
question we heard from the prime sponsor
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
that the supreme court of the state has
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this subject indicating
 
05:04:10.480 --> 05:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this subject indicating
that

05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:11.520 --> 05:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:12.480 --> 05:04:13.990 align:start position:0%
um
dissent

05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
dissent
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
is not
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
a means of determining probable cause so
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
would it stand to reason that all the
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
things you've just described as far as
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
the totality of a situation
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
you would need to build your probable
 
05:04:28.150 --> 05:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
cause on factors other than the cent
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm not familiar with i haven't read
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
the supreme court decision so i'm i
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that but if that is the case
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
is that they've determined that it can't
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
be used as the sole
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
source then
 
05:04:39.120 --> 05:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
source then
then

05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:04:41.430 --> 05:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written it doesn't
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
appear that it would
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
allow us to use that in
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
building a totality
 
05:04:46.798 --> 05:04:53.670 align:start position:0%
building a totality
case

05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.948 --> 05:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:05:00.868 --> 05:05:00.878 align:start position:0%
my question i don't know when the
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court made a decision on this
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
but i know in the past
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
i've gone out with troop a on 95 and it
 
05:05:10.230 --> 05:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
was their means of catching drug
 
05:05:10.240 --> 05:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
was their means of catching drug
traffickers

05:05:11.590 --> 05:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
traffickers
 
05:05:13.430 --> 05:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to maine
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
being able to smell this would this
 
05:05:19.510 --> 05:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh interrupt their work
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
well i i mean i don't know what the
 
05:05:24.150 --> 05:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances were in the
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
cases that you were a witness to
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
but i mean the order of
 
05:05:31.270 --> 05:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
the presence of marijuana is is
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
definitely a factor that a police
 
05:05:35.590 --> 05:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
officer can use to either establish
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
probable cause or
 
05:05:37.280 --> 05:05:38.868 align:start position:0%
probable cause or
um

05:05:38.868 --> 05:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know ask for consent or things like
 
05:05:40.958 --> 05:05:41.830 align:start position:0%
you know ask for consent or things like
that

05:05:41.830 --> 05:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the circumstances were
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
in in those cases
 
05:05:48.310 --> 05:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
but if you were not allowed to use that
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
to build a case um yes i could
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
that could hinder some of those cases
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
05:06:05.430 --> 05:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as my colleague
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
brought up the the canine issue
 
05:06:14.310 --> 05:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
is it true that canines are trained to
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
detect a wide variety of narcotics and
 
05:06:19.830 --> 05:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
when a canine alerts on a vehicle or a
 
05:06:21.990 --> 05:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
suitcase there's no way for the handler
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
to know
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
what exactly the substances he's hit on
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
until they've actually opened it is that
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
mike understanding correct yeah so i'm
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
not a i'm not a canine handler never
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
have been but yeah that is that is my
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they they can
 
05:06:39.510 --> 05:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
detect a wide array of substances
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
depending on what they are they are
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
trained on and their indication to my
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge doesn't doesn't uh you're not
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
able to determine which substance they
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just want to follow
 
05:07:00.628 --> 05:07:00.638 align:start position:0%
that thread i am
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
trying to understand from you with the
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
canine if i'm not mistaken is the center
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
for canine could be considered probable
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
cause based on um the fact that they're
 
05:07:11.670 --> 05:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
an expert for lack of a better phrase
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that's how the court deems them
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
that a hit on on odor is
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be probable cause but by this law
 
05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
that if this law to pass that would
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
definitely put that into jeopardy do you
 
05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
do you think that that could be
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely be a factor there is uh
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know typically when a canine is used
 
05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's been some reasonable suspicions
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
established um and that's used as a as
 
05:07:35.910 --> 05:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
another factor i mean if that you know
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
if if marijuana this odor of marijuana
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
was taken out of that
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
depending on how the dog was trained
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.230 --> 05:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused thank
 
05:07:50.240 --> 05:07:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused thank

there any members of the public who wish
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
to testify that have not testified
 
05:07:56.480 --> 05:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
to testify that have not testified
already

05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%

05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
you have a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:16:34.240 --> 05:16:35.590 align:start position:0%
you have a parliamentary inquiry
yes

05:16:35.590 --> 05:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the bill itself or
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was passed out it's
 
05:16:42.470 --> 05:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
the the question that is open right now
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
is is the amendment has been offered we

05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's within the chair's discretion to
 
05:20:09.680 --> 05:20:10.788 align:start position:0%
it's within the chair's discretion to

05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're not the only member of the
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee that has that complaint but
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.680 --> 05:20:24.788 align:start position:0%
 
if

05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:20:24.798 --> 05:20:26.150 align:start position:0%
if
well

05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:20:26.160 --> 05:20:27.510 align:start position:0%
well
anyway

05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative klein now you wish to

05:20:30.160 --> 05:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
second the motion of ought to pass as
amended

05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
are we going to have discussion
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative testament do you wish to
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
discuss the ought to pass as amended
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
no i
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass as amended is
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
only part of the bill
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
i have a second amendment
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
yeah that will
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
enhance the bill
 
05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
it won't cancel it but it will enhance
 
05:21:05.350 --> 05:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
it so
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
my problem is
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
that you're using essentially a
 
05:21:08.798 --> 05:21:09.910 align:start position:0%
that you're using essentially a
procedure

05:21:09.910 --> 05:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
and a
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
a mechanism
 
05:21:14.548 --> 05:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
to to basically
 
05:21:18.070 --> 05:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i understand the frustration you are
 
05:21:22.150 --> 05:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
expressing my understanding and someone
 
05:21:23.910 --> 05:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's free to correct me is that
 
05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
there only can be one amendment
 
05:21:28.150 --> 05:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
adopted and recommended by the committee
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually adopt both
 
05:21:33.430 --> 05:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
they could be merged
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
is a possibility but they i don't you
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
can't adopt one and then adopt the other
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
but we didn't even have the chance to
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
merge them
 
05:21:43.510 --> 05:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
straight to the approval of the overall
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully it is within discretion of
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee to recognize
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:55.030 --> 05:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
i understand that you may not agree with
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
how that discretion was exercised that
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
message has been received and understood
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
i understand that but in in fairness to
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.350 --> 05:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
that has happened to other other members
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
have voiced that same uh frustration on
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
other matters and other hearings
 
05:22:11.680 --> 05:22:12.390 align:start position:0%
other matters and other hearings
so

05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:22.868 --> 05:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to the
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%

some conversations on this bill and as a
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
former police officer one of the things
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
that was most concerning to me is the
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
ability for law enforcement to be able
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
to enforce
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
dui whether it's drug driving or drunk
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
driving and i appreciate the fact that
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
this bill has money specif specifically
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
set aside to allow for enhanced training
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement officers to be able
 
05:22:51.670 --> 05:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
to uh be able to enforce the laws and
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
our driving rules of the road so thank

thank you chair um i just want to for
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
the record state that this is a
 
05:23:08.708 --> 05:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
completely bipartisan
 
05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh piece of work
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
we met and worked very hard on
 
05:23:12.878 --> 05:23:14.628 align:start position:0%
we met and worked very hard on
compromising

05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
compromising
 
05:23:14.638 --> 05:23:17.030 align:start position:0%
compromising
to

05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know to be fair to everybody
 
05:23:22.310 --> 05:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
we on the house floor passed a home
 
05:23:25.350 --> 05:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
cultivation bill and this would not
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
interfere with that bill at all
 
05:23:28.868 --> 05:23:28.878 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
05:23:28.878 --> 05:23:29.910 align:start position:0%
so it's
um

05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit of everything
 
05:23:34.070 --> 05:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the state hopefully that one also
 
05:23:35.830 --> 05:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
passes but
 
05:23:37.830 --> 05:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to lower property taxes
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to fund public schools and
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to specifically go towards
 
05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
juvenile behavioral health in the state
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
so i
 
05:23:48.160 --> 05:23:49.030 align:start position:0%
so i
would

05:23:49.030 --> 05:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:23:52.390 --> 05:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%

05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate a pass on this bill it's
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
beyond time that we legalize cannabis
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and and say new hunter i i believe that
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh this is going to help us to
 
05:24:10.628 --> 05:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
bring some money song equity to the
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
state and um
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%

may present i'm just curious what is the
 
05:24:38.310 --> 05:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
impact on um
 
05:24:41.670 --> 05:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh of this bill on
 
05:24:41.680 --> 05:24:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh of this bill on
the

05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
entities that currently legally
 
05:24:48.628 --> 05:24:48.638 align:start position:0%
distribute medical cannabis in the state
 
05:24:50.548 --> 05:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
are they impacted by this are they would
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
they be allowed to continue operating
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and the answer is yes that
 
05:24:56.708 --> 05:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
they will be allowed to continue
 
05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
continue to operate
 
05:24:58.240 --> 05:24:58.948 align:start position:0%
continue to operate
and

05:24:58.948 --> 05:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:07.910 --> 05:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
and now there was a conscious effort
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
when this was drafted to not
 
05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
have any impact on the medical
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh industry which is separate in in
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
fairness those and those are enterprises
 
05:25:16.878 --> 05:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
fairness those and those are enterprises
or

05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
businesses already operating so we when
 
05:25:21.190 --> 05:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
we made sure not to do that at least
 
05:25:22.628 --> 05:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent for us to do
 
05:25:22.638 --> 05:25:23.670 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent for us to do
that

05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
you recognize again
 
05:25:27.270 --> 05:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative boulder it's just i'm
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
sorry i think um
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
after asking that i realized what my
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
question really was was how does this
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
impact the
 
05:25:34.798 --> 05:25:36.150 align:start position:0%
impact the
um

05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:38.470 --> 05:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
that provide
 
05:25:40.240 --> 05:25:41.510 align:start position:0%
that provide
services

05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:25:41.520 --> 05:25:44.390 align:start position:0%
services
currently

05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
i believe that my same answer that they
 
05:25:48.070 --> 05:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
would not be impacted by this that was
 
05:25:49.830 --> 05:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not the intent to have any
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
impact on any existing business that's
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative connolly thank you mr
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
this house has tried for many years and
 
05:26:09.430 --> 05:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
many a term to get
 
05:26:09.440 --> 05:26:10.628 align:start position:0%
many a term to get
cannabis

05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
legalization through and the outcome has
 
05:26:14.788 --> 05:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
been the same
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
um every time this represents a new
 
05:26:17.040 --> 05:26:18.548 align:start position:0%
um every time this represents a new
approach

05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
approach
 
05:26:20.548 --> 05:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
one that has not been tried
 
05:26:21.910 --> 05:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
and one that hopefully will have a
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
different outcome so i'm looking forward
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%

immigration that is jeopardizing our

this bill house bill 1266 will ensure

manchester
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
uh i have been in this country legally
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
also for 41 years but i happen to work
 
05:32:15.990 --> 05:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
with immigration i'm an immigrant
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
advocate and nobody chooses to come to
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
this country illegally the system
 
05:32:24.868 --> 05:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
precludes them from being here legally i
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
cannot spend tell you all the thousands
 
05:32:29.830 --> 05:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
of dollars that i spent to adjust my
 
05:32:29.840 --> 05:32:31.990 align:start position:0%
of dollars that i spent to adjust my
status

05:32:31.990 --> 05:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
even though i was married to a u.s
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
citizen so this is just a side i'm here
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
um against this bill
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
part of my job is to build relationships
 
05:32:47.030 --> 05:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
with the police
 
05:32:47.040 --> 05:32:48.230 align:start position:0%
with the police
from

05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:32:50.708 --> 05:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
all latin american countries and for the
 
05:32:53.670 --> 05:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
most part african countries our police
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
officers are crooked they're mean
 
05:32:58.830 --> 05:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
they're corrupted and they're
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
criminals and that's what we grow
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
weary and scared of them in our own
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
countries i remember my mom always told
 
05:33:09.510 --> 05:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
me stay away from the cops don't you
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
ever ask
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
for help from them
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
because if something does if the rubber
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't rob you the cub will
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
and this is what
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
our reality is when we come to this
 
05:33:22.798 --> 05:33:23.910 align:start position:0%
our reality is when we come to this
country

05:33:23.910 --> 05:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
we fear the police because that's all
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
we've learned i was a victim of a sex
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
crime in college
 
05:33:32.788 --> 05:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
and i knew who had done it
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
and i was so afraid of the police that i
 
05:33:37.270 --> 05:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
just swallowed it and i lived with it
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
because i was more fearful of the police
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
when i came to new hampshire i started
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
building relationships with my
 
05:33:49.670 --> 05:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
department in manchester
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
we first approached them
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about issues of profiling
 
05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
and i built a relationship with them and
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
i learned to see
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
that what i have learned at home doesn't
 
05:34:01.350 --> 05:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
apply here
 
05:34:03.030 --> 05:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
the our police departments are an
 
05:34:05.110 --> 05:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
honorable profession
 
05:34:05.120 --> 05:34:06.070 align:start position:0%
honorable profession
and

05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
that they are here to help us and to
 
05:34:09.990 --> 05:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
serve us
 
05:34:10.000 --> 05:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
serve us
so

05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
i have worked with them for many many
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
years i still uh go all over the place
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have built all kinds of relationships
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would undo all those 20 some
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
years of work that we have done to
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
foster trust
 
05:34:30.628 --> 05:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
in our police department
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to help anything
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's not needed
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to preclude people
 
05:34:39.270 --> 05:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
from trusting the police to come and
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
report crimes
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to make all our
 
05:34:45.590 --> 05:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
communities unsafe this bill is going to
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
make our police departments prone to
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.868 --> 05:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
there is no reason to have a bill first
 
05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
of all our we do not have the resources
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
to do the feds jobs they have plenty of
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
money and they do their own thing so our
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
police department should not use the
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
resources that they need to keep our
 
05:35:08.470 --> 05:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
community safe
 
05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
persecuting people that are here
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
undocumented there's already rules in
 
05:35:14.470 --> 05:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
the books
 
05:35:14.480 --> 05:35:15.190 align:start position:0%
the books
to

05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:35:16.948 --> 05:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
go after those
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
people that commit crimes that happen to
 
05:35:21.030 --> 05:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
be undocumented immigrants
 
05:35:23.910 --> 05:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
so this is only just gonna help people
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
do profiling
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
so i just
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
want you to think about it and
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um thank you miss
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
castillo for your testimony today it was
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
very brave um and coming forward i
 
05:35:47.350 --> 05:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
05:35:47.360 --> 05:35:48.470 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
um

05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
do undocumented people pay taxes
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
undocumented people pay taxes they do
 
05:35:55.590 --> 05:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
not have the right to get a social
 
05:35:57.670 --> 05:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
security number and the right to work
 
05:35:59.590 --> 05:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
but if you do not work in this country
 
05:36:00.948 --> 05:36:00.958 align:start position:0%
you do not eat
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
irs has a tax id number and that's what
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
they use to claim their taxes and they
 
05:36:09.750 --> 05:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
do pay their taxes
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
you spoke about the
 
05:36:21.750 --> 05:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that this legislation would
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
exacerbate relationships between the
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
public and police
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
is it the case
 
05:36:29.590 --> 05:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge that
 
05:36:31.990 --> 05:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
this would possibly discourage victims
 
05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
of sex trafficking
 
05:36:33.760 --> 05:36:34.548 align:start position:0%
of sex trafficking
from

05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:36:37.750 --> 05:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
going to police for fear of
 
05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
being caught in
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
legal troubles
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
of course and and you know it has
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
happened before when we did not have
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
those open related and trusting
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
relationships where people did not want
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
to go to the police and it's still you
 
05:36:54.310 --> 05:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
know a work in progress i have to work
 
05:36:56.150 --> 05:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
on the immigrant communities to trust
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
the police but many times they're safer
 
05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
they feel safer if they
 
05:37:01.990 --> 05:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
tell me and i'll go with them to the
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
police departments but it's definitely
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to deter people from reporting
 
05:37:06.718 --> 05:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
going to deter people from reporting
crime

05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:37:08.400 --> 05:37:11.590 align:start position:0%
crime
follow

05:37:11.590 --> 05:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing a follow-up
 
05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
so that makes me wonder if a police
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
department has a policy that um if
 
05:37:20.868 --> 05:37:20.878 align:start position:0%
someone's brought to this country
 
05:37:20.878 --> 05:37:22.310 align:start position:0%
someone's brought to this country
illegally

05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
05:37:24.628 --> 05:37:24.638 align:start position:0%
um and they're being victimized being
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
sex trafficked
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
if the if the police government
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
department has a policy that they will
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
not um
 
05:37:32.548 --> 05:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
prosecute that person for being in the
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
country illegally because they came here
 
05:37:36.628 --> 05:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
through sex trafficking would this bill
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
require the police department to abandon
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
that policy require the police
 
05:37:42.070 --> 05:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
department to prosecute a victim of sex
 
05:37:42.080 --> 05:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
department to prosecute a victim of sex
trafficking

05:37:43.510 --> 05:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
there are special visas for victims of
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking so i don't think this
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
would affect that person but say
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
somebody happens to be driving without a
 
05:37:54.000 --> 05:37:55.030 align:start position:0%
somebody happens to be driving without a
license

05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
and they get stopped for an infraction
 
05:37:59.110 --> 05:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
then the police department will be
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
mandated to call the police to cold eyes
 
05:38:05.110 --> 05:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
on somebody that just happens to be or
 
05:38:06.548 --> 05:38:06.558 align:start position:0%
if they just happen to encounter
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
somebody walking on the street that fits
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
the description of whatever somebody
 
05:38:14.070 --> 05:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
that they're looking for and they decide
 
05:38:16.230 --> 05:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
that they check their documentation and
 
05:38:19.030 --> 05:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
find out they're undocumented then those
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
people will be affected i don't think it
 
05:38:23.830 --> 05:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
would affect uh victims of domestic
 
05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
violence per se because there are
 
05:38:27.590 --> 05:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
special visas
 
05:38:33.510 --> 05:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%

first regarding our current u.s
 
05:38:47.600 --> 05:38:48.868 align:start position:0%
first regarding our current u.s
immigration

05:38:48.868 --> 05:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
05:38:48.878 --> 05:38:50.868 align:start position:0%
immigration
laws

05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
laws
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
are there limits to the amount of visas
 
05:38:55.990 --> 05:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
that are available and do you feel well
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is actually part of the same first
 
05:38:57.760 --> 05:38:59.750 align:start position:0%
this is actually part of the same first
question

05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:39:02.310 --> 05:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire's businesses need
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
more visas and are you know available
 
05:39:05.360 --> 05:39:06.868 align:start position:0%
more visas and are you know available
visas

05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
visas
 
05:39:09.430 --> 05:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
oh yes there's limits of all kinds of
 
05:39:12.230 --> 05:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
visas the work visas and there there's
 
05:39:14.230 --> 05:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
different visa categories and there's
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know the main
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
way to immigrate to this country is
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
through family
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
relations but the countries that send
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
the most
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
people mexico philippines they only
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
qualify for like i haven't done this for
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
like 12 000 visas a year
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
so there's 19 million people waiting for
 
05:39:33.920 --> 05:39:35.030 align:start position:0%
so there's 19 million people waiting for
those

05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:39:37.990 --> 05:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
so it is really hard to to come into a
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
visa in fact
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
two days ago i got a an email from a
 
05:39:44.548 --> 05:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
company up north that is desperate
 
05:39:46.948 --> 05:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
looking for workers and ask me please
 
05:39:49.270 --> 05:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
help me find people that are willing to
 
05:39:49.280 --> 05:39:50.548 align:start position:0%
help me find people that are willing to
relocate

05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
relocate
 
05:39:53.670 --> 05:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the north country and i'll employ
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
them because we are really lacking
 
05:39:59.750 --> 05:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh employ employees we we cannot find
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative schultz you recognize for
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you this is actually a
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
separate question
 
05:40:08.400 --> 05:40:09.350 align:start position:0%
separate question
um

05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
and this is looking at
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
information that was handed out before
 
05:40:16.470 --> 05:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
we started talking about this bill so
 
05:40:18.070 --> 05:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
you haven't heard the testimony or
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
probably seen the information that we
 
05:40:21.430 --> 05:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
were handed
 
05:40:21.440 --> 05:40:22.310 align:start position:0%
were handed
but

05:40:22.310 --> 05:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
a national organization is here and
 
05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
presented information about violent
 
05:40:29.430 --> 05:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
criminals that are undocumented is there
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage of violent criminals
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
in the undocumented population
 
05:40:37.270 --> 05:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
no and if that national
 
05:40:40.548 --> 05:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
organization happens to be fair it is a
 
05:40:42.868 --> 05:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
an organization that has been catalogued
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
by the southern poverty law center as a
 
05:40:45.280 --> 05:40:46.150 align:start position:0%
by the southern poverty law center as a
hate

05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
hate
 
05:40:47.990 --> 05:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh organization
 
05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
and uh that's not that's not true in
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
fact undocumented immigrants commit far
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
lesser crimes
 
05:40:55.600 --> 05:40:56.628 align:start position:0%
lesser crimes
the

05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:59.590 --> 05:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
native uh born or people that have green
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
cards because they know what's at stake
 
05:41:04.150 --> 05:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
also you know they come here to work
 
05:41:06.548 --> 05:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
hard and that's all they want to do make
 
05:41:09.430 --> 05:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
life better for their family just
 
05:41:12.310 --> 05:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
like a lot of your ancestors did when
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
they first came to this country and the
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
difference is that probably
 
05:41:19.990 --> 05:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
prior to 1924 there was no visa so all
 
05:41:22.390 --> 05:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
that people needed to do was show up
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
and be counted my own family comes from
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
italy but they just happened to to stay
 
05:41:29.110 --> 05:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
in latin america but if they had come
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
here that would have been the case too
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
representative testimony thank you thank
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%

you said
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
something the effect of
 
05:41:52.868 --> 05:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to should be able to
 
05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
come to this country
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
and work and have
 
05:41:57.600 --> 05:41:58.868 align:start position:0%

a
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
documents and so on there should be no
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
limits to the people who come is there a
 
05:42:02.320 --> 05:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
limits to the people who come is there a
question

05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
i mean did you say that
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%

05:42:40.628 --> 05:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair good afternoon
 
05:42:43.750 --> 05:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
members of the community the community
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
my name is bruno de brito
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
and i am president of the new hampshire
 
05:42:51.190 --> 05:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
brazilian council and i am also an
 
05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
i am here today
 
05:42:59.270 --> 05:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
to speak about uh against
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
contrary to what many believe
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
immigration is not a criminal matter
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's a civil offense
 
05:43:10.400 --> 05:43:12.230 align:start position:0%
it's a civil offense
also

05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:43:14.788 --> 05:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
anybody that came here
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
before 1924
 
05:43:20.070 --> 05:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
came here without a visa
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
so the same concept that these
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
individuals they are being called
 
05:43:27.590 --> 05:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
illegals today
 
05:43:29.590 --> 05:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that they were illegal
 
05:43:29.600 --> 05:43:30.470 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that they were illegal
before

05:43:30.470 --> 05:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:43:33.030 --> 05:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
but simply they are being
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
made illegal today
 
05:43:38.708 --> 05:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately you know people cannot
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
be considered illegal to be illegal
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
only drugs
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
contraband can be legal
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about uh you know like
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
it is a you know like an extreme
 
05:43:58.400 --> 05:43:59.350 align:start position:0%
it is a you know like an extreme
um

05:43:59.350 --> 05:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
bad term to use
 
05:44:03.590 --> 05:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
towards a human being
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
we should refer as
 
05:44:08.948 --> 05:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know simply as you know people
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
and not illegals
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
also as my colleague eva
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
castillo you know i have mentioned
 
05:44:17.360 --> 05:44:18.390 align:start position:0%
castillo you know i have mentioned
before

05:44:18.390 --> 05:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have worked with law enforcement
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
for many many years to establish a
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
relationship between law enforcement and
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
the community because you know crimes do
 
05:44:32.470 --> 05:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
happen in the community and not
 
05:44:34.628 --> 05:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily they are committed by you
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
know immigrants
 
05:44:39.110 --> 05:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
they are you know committed by everybody
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
and you know the rate of crime committed
 
05:44:42.000 --> 05:44:42.868 align:start position:0%
and you know the rate of crime committed
by

05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
immigrants are not necessarily
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh related to you know the increase of
 
05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
immigrants who are undocumented you know
 
05:44:53.190 --> 05:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
coming to the community there is a study
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
that i tried actually to to pull up
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
um that actually has
 
05:45:00.470 --> 05:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
um that has been done in the national
 
05:45:01.990 --> 05:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
metro area
 
05:45:02.000 --> 05:45:02.948 align:start position:0%
metro area
that

05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:02.958 --> 05:45:04.070 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
that really breaks this link
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know about the premises that
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
the increase of crimes are related to
 
05:45:14.230 --> 05:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
the increase of immigrants coming to the
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
community unfortunately i wasn't i
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to
 
05:45:21.750 --> 05:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
um you know to to find that
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know when when i was called
 
05:45:26.708 --> 05:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
but um but there is a study and i can
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
pull it up and i'll be more than happy
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
to share with you guys
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh and as she said you know like we have
 
05:45:34.470 --> 05:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
established the relationships you know
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
like with police officers uh chiefs of
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
police uh the attorney general's office
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know to to work again to create
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know like a bridge between the
 
05:45:47.350 --> 05:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
community and law enforcement and help
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
them to to solve crimes um
 
05:45:53.190 --> 05:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
and you know like and unfortunately
 
05:45:55.110 --> 05:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
these violent crimes as you know like as
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
i mentioned uh there is a memo by a
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
sheriff from from massachusetts that you
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
know only states one isolated case
 
05:46:07.270 --> 05:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
that you know tries to to broaden what
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
really happens in the community so
 
05:46:11.830 --> 05:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
immigrants you know they just you know
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
come here for the same reasons as you
 
05:46:17.750 --> 05:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
know your ancestors you know came here
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
they come here you know to seek a better
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
life they come here so you know that
 
05:46:25.510 --> 05:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
kids you know can get a better education
 
05:46:28.548 --> 05:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
so one day they can become professionals
 
05:46:30.708 --> 05:46:30.718 align:start position:0%
and you know fulfill you know like their
 
05:46:33.030 --> 05:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
dreams and you know they don't you know
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
come here to oh yeah you know like we're
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
gonna go to the united states so we can
 
05:46:39.990 --> 05:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know start robbing you know cvs so
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's not that
 
05:46:42.160 --> 05:46:43.030 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's not that
so

05:46:43.030 --> 05:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
you know like one day you know these
 
05:46:47.750 --> 05:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
kids you know their fruit of
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know the immigrants that are coming
 
05:46:52.948 --> 05:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
here that many of you label as
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
illegals they're gonna be sitting where
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
you are right now so you know give them
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
a chance and stop labeling them as
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm open to any questions representative
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
lang you're recognized thank you sir
 
05:47:12.150 --> 05:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:47:15.830 --> 05:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to try and back up a little
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
bit in the conversational higher view of
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
this we're talking about policies
 
05:47:22.548 --> 05:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
and establishing policies my question to
 
05:47:25.270 --> 05:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
you is is it good public policy that the
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
state would allow a political
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision under it
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
to create a policy to ignore law and not
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
enforce law is that good public policy
 
05:47:38.868 --> 05:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
so it's not uh so it's not that they're
 
05:47:41.510 --> 05:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
not enforcing law and that's the beauty
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
of it so what we you know like have you
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
know like with the chiefs of police uh
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
you know like today state
 
05:47:48.868 --> 05:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes you are going to enforce the law if
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know there is a warrant you know
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
like uh in like on your name if you are
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know like an immigrant you know the
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
police you know like pull you over yes
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
you are going to be detained you are
 
05:48:04.470 --> 05:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
going to be placed in removal
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings but if you are here
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
and you get pulled over because you know
 
05:48:12.548 --> 05:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
like you didn't put your blinker on and
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
you got pulled over uh the police
 
05:48:17.190 --> 05:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
officer comes to you uh asks you to
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
present your license and you're unable
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
to produce your driver's license so the
 
05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
and you're only here you know to feed
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
your family to get in like a better life
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have any crimes you don't have
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
05:48:28.638 --> 05:48:29.750 align:start position:0%
anything else
so

05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:33.190 --> 05:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
so in that case yes so the the person
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
will be sent to you know to the court
 
05:48:38.390 --> 05:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
pay the fines that they have you know to
 
05:48:39.990 --> 05:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
pay with the state
 
05:48:41.590 --> 05:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
but they're not going to be asked you
 
05:48:42.628 --> 05:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
know to
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
um you know they're they're not going to
 
05:48:47.350 --> 05:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
call ice uh which is immigration customs
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh which is a different
 
05:48:49.920 --> 05:48:51.190 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh which is a different
jurisdiction

05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
because the the job of you know the
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
local police is to enforce local laws
 
05:48:59.590 --> 05:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
and not federal laws so we are trying to
 
05:48:59.600 --> 05:49:00.390 align:start position:0%
and not federal laws so we are trying to
keep

05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
keep
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
this separate that's all we're doing
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair recognized for a
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
so again i'm trying to get because this
 
05:49:11.030 --> 05:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually talk about an
 
05:49:13.590 --> 05:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
individual right this is talking about
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as it exists is about
 
05:49:18.150 --> 05:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
this state age about political
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
subdivisions towns cities police
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
departments establishing policies
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
that says we won't enforce
 
05:49:26.080 --> 05:49:27.030 align:start position:0%
that says we won't enforce
law

05:49:27.030 --> 05:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:49:30.070 --> 05:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
and and my question is is that good
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
public policy that we allow those
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
those organizations to establish overall
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
policy that would govern it govern
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
itself to say that we're not going to
 
05:49:43.270 --> 05:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
enforce a law that was lawfully enacted
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
no it is indeed a good public policy
 
05:49:49.830 --> 05:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
because as i mentioned before if it is
 
05:49:52.548 --> 05:49:52.558 align:start position:0%
someone that hasn't committed a crime
 
05:49:55.430 --> 05:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay so that it is not the job of the
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
state to enforce federal laws uh and
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually would be you know like deemed
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh as we have seen uh
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know like in the case of uh us via
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
arizona in 2012. okay
 
05:50:11.030 --> 05:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
so it is uh you know the job of the
 
05:50:11.040 --> 05:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
so it is uh you know the job of the
state

05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:50:14.470 --> 05:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
to enforce state laws it is the job of
 
05:50:16.788 --> 05:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
the towing cities you know to enforce
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
local laws
 
05:50:20.150 --> 05:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
and it is the job of the federal
 
05:50:22.470 --> 05:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
government to enforce federal laws
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we should all keep them separately
 
05:50:27.510 --> 05:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
we the state should not be burdened
 
05:50:27.520 --> 05:50:28.628 align:start position:0%
we the state should not be burdened
because

05:50:28.628 --> 05:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:50:31.270 --> 05:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have that money uh you know to
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
be enforcing uh you know like federal
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
law and we don't get any you know like
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
federal money to enforce federal law
 
05:50:39.360 --> 05:50:40.230 align:start position:0%
federal money to enforce federal law
so

05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes it is a good uh public policy
 
05:50:45.670 --> 05:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
because these are families in the
 
05:50:48.310 --> 05:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
communities a lot of families were torn
 
05:50:48.320 --> 05:50:49.350 align:start position:0%
communities a lot of families were torn
apart

05:50:49.350 --> 05:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
apart
 
05:50:52.230 --> 05:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know so imagine like you're going
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh you know like out to uh you know to
 
05:50:55.990 --> 05:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
your work
 
05:50:57.910 --> 05:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
and you know like and when it's you know
 
05:51:00.230 --> 05:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
like a lunch time you get a call you
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
know saying that your wife was detained
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
and you know like you're not you're not
 
05:51:06.070 --> 05:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
gonna see your life you know for
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
probably in like another year unless
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're able to travel to another state
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh in locking detention and you know
 
05:51:16.310 --> 05:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
your wife is placed in removal
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings so it's something that you
 
05:51:20.548 --> 05:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
don't expect and these individuals every
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
day these are families again
 
05:51:24.868 --> 05:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh you know the good people yeah let's
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
keep them here you know like criminals
 
05:51:29.670 --> 05:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
yes the police officers they do enforce
 
05:51:32.470 --> 05:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
the warrant that's part of uh you know
 
05:51:36.470 --> 05:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:38.470 --> 05:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%

the
 
05:51:43.830 --> 05:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill didn't take
 
05:51:46.948 --> 05:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
questions but did mention the concept of
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
sanctuaries like sanctuary churches
 
05:51:52.788 --> 05:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
sanctuary congregations sanctuary cities
 
05:51:54.470 --> 05:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
in what way
 
05:51:56.548 --> 05:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
has the sanctuary
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh aspect that i guess this bill is
 
05:52:01.110 --> 05:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
trying to address
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
um been a benefit to our society
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
so honestly um
 
05:52:11.670 --> 05:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
i i see it as um
 
05:52:14.230 --> 05:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
you know like on you know like
 
05:52:16.230 --> 05:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
i see it differently you know like how
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
can you knock this harm actually uh you
 
05:52:23.350 --> 05:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
know to to this day to this day uh
 
05:52:25.628 --> 05:52:25.638 align:start position:0%
we have no history
 
05:52:25.638 --> 05:52:27.270 align:start position:0%
we have no history
whatsoever

05:52:27.270 --> 05:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
05:52:30.150 --> 05:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
from uh you know like a uh
 
05:52:31.990 --> 05:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know like an agency or anybody
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
trying to interfere
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
with item and customs enforcement we
 
05:52:39.030 --> 05:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any history in the state to
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
to this date so that's how i see it
 
05:52:46.708 --> 05:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:46.718 --> 05:52:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
perez thank you for taking my question
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me what the
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
when someone call
 
05:52:58.320 --> 05:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
when someone call
um

05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:01.910 --> 05:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
someone illegal alien
 
05:53:06.150 --> 05:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:09.030 --> 05:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
um yes so uh you know like an illegal
 
05:53:12.230 --> 05:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
alien unfortunately is used uh you know
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
by uh you know like a circle a certain
 
05:53:16.868 --> 05:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
group of individuals uh you know to to
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
look down uh you know like upon um
 
05:53:22.548 --> 05:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
another and undocumented you know like
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
immigrants is more uh you know like
 
05:53:27.270 --> 05:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
within you know the the boundaries you
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
know like of the law because the law you
 
05:53:32.230 --> 05:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
know requires that you know someone you
 
05:53:34.548 --> 05:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
know carries you know like a document
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh and then if that person doesn't carry
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
a document you know they are
 
05:53:38.400 --> 05:53:40.708 align:start position:0%
a document you know they are
undocumented

05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
05:53:40.718 --> 05:53:42.628 align:start position:0%
undocumented
follow-up

05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:53:45.270 --> 05:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up thank you
 
05:53:47.830 --> 05:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you believe that we have to
 
05:53:47.840 --> 05:53:50.470 align:start position:0%
uh do you believe that we have to
educate

05:53:50.470 --> 05:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
educate
 
05:53:54.150 --> 05:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
our the people in our communities to
 
05:53:56.788 --> 05:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
when they making a document to make sure
 
05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
they don't use the illegal alien word
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the documents instead using the the
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
did the word
 
05:54:07.030 --> 05:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
and don't document the person the member
 
05:54:08.470 --> 05:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
would just suspend
 
05:54:09.830 --> 05:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
we might try to keep the questions
 
05:54:12.070 --> 05:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
jermaine to the bill
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
the prior question i thought was
 
05:54:13.760 --> 05:54:18.788 align:start position:0%
the prior question i thought was
acceptable

05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:18.798 --> 05:54:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
but would you remember i wish to ask a
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
different question not
 
05:54:25.830 --> 05:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
is jermaine to the bill
 
05:54:29.910 --> 05:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.150 --> 05:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
the ques the question was was deemed
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
out of what the chair ruled it out of
 
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
order okay if i can just the chair would
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
inquire one question and thank you for
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony and taking my question
 
05:54:41.270 --> 05:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely if a person enters the
 
05:54:43.270 --> 05:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
country lawfully under our current
 
05:54:45.190 --> 05:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
what is the i guess objection to then
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
enforcing our immigration laws while the
 
05:54:53.110 --> 05:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
person's in the country
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
so in regards to placing them in removal
 
05:54:56.240 --> 05:54:58.070 align:start position:0%
so in regards to placing them in removal
proceedings

05:54:58.070 --> 05:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't understand your
 
05:54:59.840 --> 05:55:01.110 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't understand your
question

05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'll re i'll rephrase it if a
 
05:55:05.430 --> 05:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
person enters the united states of
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
america legally okay under our current
 
05:55:09.430 --> 05:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
immigration laws if that person is now
 
05:55:12.150 --> 05:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
in our country legally what is your the
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
objection to actually continuing to
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
enforce the immigration laws the same
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
laws that allow them to enter the
 
05:55:17.440 --> 05:55:19.430 align:start position:0%
laws that allow them to enter the
country

05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:55:22.470 --> 05:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
so i mean um yeah i'm i'm honestly
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
having a little bit difficulty
 
05:55:26.070 --> 05:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
understanding i'm sorry
 
05:55:28.708 --> 05:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
but essentially uh you know if the the
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
person enters you know the country you
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
know like with a visa or you know like
 
05:55:36.470 --> 05:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
with you know like a green card uh you
 
05:55:38.390 --> 05:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
know they're the same way that
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh the law is enforced
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
for uh documented individuals it is
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
enforced against uh
 
05:55:50.070 --> 05:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
undocumented individuals and even if you
 
05:55:54.070 --> 05:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
come here with a visa
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
you have to to follow certain
 
05:55:55.920 --> 05:55:57.190 align:start position:0%
you have to to follow certain
requirements

05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:55:58.948 --> 05:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
typically you know like a non-immigrant
 
05:56:01.830 --> 05:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
visa when you come to this country you
 
05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a certain amount of periods here in
 
05:56:06.470 --> 05:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
this country and you're not allowed to
 
05:56:08.948 --> 05:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
to get a green card uh you know through
 
05:56:12.230 --> 05:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
the immigrant visa okay uh unless you
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
know certain you know exceptional
 
05:56:16.708 --> 05:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
exceptional circumstances you know like
 
05:56:16.718 --> 05:56:17.670 align:start position:0%
exceptional circumstances you know like
happen

05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and then you're able to adjust
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
your status okay but that's a different
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
topic uh but if you violate you know the
 
05:56:27.670 --> 05:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
conditions you know like of your visa
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
then um
 
05:56:29.440 --> 05:56:30.310 align:start position:0%
then um
you

05:56:30.310 --> 05:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:56:31.510 --> 05:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
you may
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
be deemed
 
05:56:35.350 --> 05:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
um deportable
 
05:56:35.360 --> 05:56:36.390 align:start position:0%
um deportable
so

05:56:36.390 --> 05:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:39.430 --> 05:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know so pretty much it goes back to
 
05:56:41.670 --> 05:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
essentially you become undocumented and
 
05:56:43.830 --> 05:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
the majority of the individuals who are
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
here undocumented they actually they did
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:00.310 --> 05:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.750 --> 05:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:57:05.350 --> 05:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.868 --> 05:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
when i look at this laura
 
05:57:09.590 --> 05:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
my question is about how it potentially
 
05:57:12.150 --> 05:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
could be implemented
 
05:57:14.470 --> 05:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
and and the question is if you have
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
someone who is born here
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
and for some reason is
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
and is a legal citizen
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
and may have an accent
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
or or an appearance that someone may say
 
05:57:29.590 --> 05:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
think that they are
 
05:57:31.510 --> 05:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
could be illegal or not illegal
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
or anybody really
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
how does that person then prove it if in
 
05:57:38.070 --> 05:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
fact they were born here would you have
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
to ask everybody if you couldn't if you
 
05:57:42.830 --> 05:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't have any discretion as an
 
05:57:44.708 --> 05:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
agency um
 
05:57:44.718 --> 05:57:45.830 align:start position:0%
agency um
to

05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
they would then have to say you have to
 
05:57:49.350 --> 05:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
check every time you stop someone you
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
have to check and make sure that
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
05:57:55.110 --> 05:57:55.120 align:start position:0%

05:58:00.390 --> 05:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
another you know like another thing uh
 
05:58:02.708 --> 05:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so we wouldn't have to start asking
 
05:58:05.830 --> 05:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
people uh you know for for citizenship
 
05:58:07.670 --> 05:58:07.680 align:start position:0%

um and you know there are there are a
 
05:58:11.990 --> 05:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
lot of in like us citizens believe it or
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
not they're unable to prove that they
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
are you know like us citizens i have
 
05:58:19.030 --> 05:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
come across you know like a few uh you
 
05:58:20.708 --> 05:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
know in the past in like a couple of
 
05:58:22.788 --> 05:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
years and actually they ended up you
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
know i can remove proceedings and you
 
05:58:27.190 --> 05:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
know like and even veterans uh believe
 
05:58:29.430 --> 05:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
it or not even veterans and you know i
 
05:58:31.830 --> 05:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
can that's the the issue uh you know
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
like with you know one of the issues you
 
05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
know like with uh you know this bill
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
and you know coming here you know
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
documented or you know like undocumented
 
05:58:44.230 --> 05:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
um you know there are certain you know
 
05:58:47.990 --> 05:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh very slim possibilities for these
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
individuals to actually become you know
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
like legalized um and actually there's a
 
05:58:56.708 --> 05:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
report that you know uh you know that
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
that came uh came out recently um you
 
05:59:01.830 --> 05:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
know that shared you know like what are
 
05:59:02.948 --> 05:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
the most
 
05:59:05.990 --> 05:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh immigrant uh populations in each
 
05:59:06.000 --> 05:59:07.030 align:start position:0%
uh immigrant uh populations in each
state

05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i can guess what is the
 
05:59:12.070 --> 05:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
biggest most populous
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%

documented
 
05:59:22.788 --> 05:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
guess which one it is
 
05:59:25.510 --> 05:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes you guys to correct it correctly
 
05:59:25.520 --> 05:59:26.708 align:start position:0%
yes you guys to correct it correctly
canadians

05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
canadians
 
05:59:29.350 --> 05:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i bet you know some of you might you
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
know might have thought mexicans but
 
05:59:39.030 --> 05:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:59:42.628 --> 05:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized for
 
05:59:44.310 --> 05:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chair thank you
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i'm over here
 
05:59:47.990 --> 05:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
front and center hello oh sorry that's
 
05:59:48.000 --> 05:59:48.948 align:start position:0%
front and center hello oh sorry that's
okay

05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:59:52.470 --> 05:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
um okay um it seems like we were getting
 
05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
far from this the law itself my question
 
05:59:59.030 --> 05:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
to you is
 
06:00:01.270 --> 06:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
how does somebody get an ice detainer
 
06:00:03.430 --> 06:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
put on them
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
so so pretty much so that the only way
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
is is if ice comes uh you know in
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
contact with them
 
06:00:13.830 --> 06:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay so either
 
06:00:15.750 --> 06:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you know they they give you know
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
themselves up in like at the border
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
which you know is happening a lot
 
06:00:22.000 --> 06:00:22.788 align:start position:0%
which you know is happening a lot
so

06:00:22.788 --> 06:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:24.868 --> 06:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
customers in border patrol they process
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
these individuals they are handled over
 
06:00:27.360 --> 06:00:28.230 align:start position:0%
these individuals they are handled over
to

06:00:28.230 --> 06:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
immigration and customs enforcement ice
 
06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
and ice is the agency responsible to
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
begin the removal proceedings of these
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
individuals uh so that's one way another
 
06:00:44.830 --> 06:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
way is if someone
 
06:00:44.840 --> 06:00:46.470 align:start position:0%
way is if someone
um

06:00:46.470 --> 06:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:48.868 --> 06:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
if someone you know like reports you
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
know like an individual and you know the
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
individual is actually interest uh you
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
know like of ice
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh so then ice uh you know comes
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh in contact interact with them and and
 
06:01:04.150 --> 06:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
then uh may place them in removal
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings or in some cases uh in order
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
of supervision and you know there are
 
06:01:11.990 --> 06:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
other avenues that you know like ice
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
uses depending on the the person
 
06:01:19.030 --> 06:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
so or if someone
 
06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
documented or undocumented
 
06:01:26.548 --> 06:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
they commit a serious crime
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
and and pretty much
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
and this crime is deportable uh then ice
 
06:01:35.830 --> 06:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
comes in contact uh in like with them
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:44.470 --> 06:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up thank you
 
06:01:47.030 --> 06:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
so is it is it your position
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
that it's not okay or not good policy
 
06:01:53.270 --> 06:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the local law enforcement to call
 
06:01:56.070 --> 06:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
ice and inquire about that detainer if
 
06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
in your own words some of the people may
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
have committed serious crimes so if they
 
06:02:01.750 --> 06:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
have committed certain uh you know
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
serious crimes ice will definitely there
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
is no question you know like about that
 
06:02:08.470 --> 06:02:08.480 align:start position:0%

only time there's ever a limitation on
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
the questions is more due to time
 
06:04:21.030 --> 06:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
constraints than
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
06:04:27.190 --> 06:04:27.200 align:start position:0%

grade
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
i grew up in manchester i've been in
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
this country since 1989 and i was
 
06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
shopping with my aunties
 
06:05:48.470 --> 06:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
up up where ames used to be on hanover
 
06:05:51.110 --> 06:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
street and i lost them in the store i
 
06:05:52.708 --> 06:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't find them and i was really
 
06:05:55.110 --> 06:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
really scared so in my child mind the
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
best thing i thought could i could do
 
06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
was to leave the store walk across the
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
parking lot get onto hanover street and
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
somehow make my way home by following
 
06:06:05.830 --> 06:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
the lights of downtown that i could see
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i was walking and walking and walking
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
and walking
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
and i started to cry because i was dark
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i was scared and i didn't know where
 
06:06:13.190 --> 06:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
my family was
 
06:06:14.708 --> 06:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
a really really nice couple who was
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
taking an evening stroll
 
06:06:17.830 --> 06:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
heard me
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
found me
 
06:06:21.030 --> 06:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
asked me what was wrong took me to a
 
06:06:22.708 --> 06:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
and while i was there and they were
 
06:06:25.510 --> 06:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
giving me some candy and everyone was
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
really really nice to me a manchester
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
police officer came over picked me up
 
06:06:32.070 --> 06:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
and took me to the station
 
06:06:33.990 --> 06:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
when i went over there after a little
 
06:06:35.270 --> 06:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
while where all the officers were
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
treating me very kindly asking me where
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
i was from what my name was they were
 
06:06:41.270 --> 06:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
finally able to find my aunts who were
 
06:06:43.350 --> 06:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
able to come over and get me
 
06:06:45.430 --> 06:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
now this is a pretty typical story i'm
 
06:06:47.350 --> 06:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
sure for those of you who have kids
 
06:06:49.990 --> 06:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
either your own or in your family and
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
what's notable about this particular
 
06:06:53.190 --> 06:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
story is that at the time i was
 
06:06:55.830 --> 06:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
undocumented i came into this country in
 
06:06:59.190 --> 06:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
1989 on a visa so i came here as you say
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
technically legally i outstayed that
 
06:07:03.270 --> 06:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
visa but at the time i did not know that
 
06:07:06.150 --> 06:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
because i was a child i was undocumented
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
my mother was undocumented and many
 
06:07:10.390 --> 06:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
members of my family were undocumented
 
06:07:13.190 --> 06:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
if a bill like this passes or had passed
 
06:07:14.310 --> 06:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
back then
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
it would have meant that if when i was
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
picked up by the police
 
06:07:20.788 --> 06:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
they would have know they would have had
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
to report us
 
06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
to immigration
 
06:07:25.350 --> 06:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
and then we would have been picked up
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
and i would not be standing here with
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
you today i would not have gone to
 
06:07:30.548 --> 06:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
school would not have graduated bought a
 
06:07:33.430 --> 06:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
home married my husband and settled here
 
06:07:35.590 --> 06:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire which is my home
 
06:07:35.600 --> 06:07:36.868 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire which is my home
so

06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:42.470 --> 06:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do what it says that
 
06:07:44.310 --> 06:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
it claims that it does i know that as
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
lawmakers one of the things that you
 
06:07:48.070 --> 06:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
have to weigh the most is intent over
 
06:07:48.080 --> 06:07:49.030 align:start position:0%
have to weigh the most is intent over
impact

06:07:49.030 --> 06:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
impact
 
06:07:50.708 --> 06:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
and the impact of this bill is to
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
undermine what municipalities have many
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities including manchester in
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
fact manchester was the vanguard have
 
06:07:59.670 --> 06:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
created in order to ensure that all
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
members of our communities feel safe
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
and feel that they can rely and trust
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
and go to the systems of support and
 
06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
safety and care that we have set up
 
06:08:11.190 --> 06:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
this bill in thinking about the impact
 
06:08:13.830 --> 06:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
that it has on municipalities undermines
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
local control
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
it tells municipalities it punishes a
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
problem that is not in fact happening
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement have done an
 
06:08:25.510 --> 06:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
incredible job attempting to connect
 
06:08:27.430 --> 06:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
with the community respond to the
 
06:08:27.440 --> 06:08:28.470 align:start position:0%
with the community respond to the
community

06:08:28.470 --> 06:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to serve the communities that
 
06:08:33.190 --> 06:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
they come from and a bill like this
 
06:08:34.948 --> 06:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
undermines that it
 
06:08:37.190 --> 06:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
undermines those relationships and it
 
06:08:39.030 --> 06:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
goes against the very values that we
 
06:08:40.708 --> 06:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
have as a state
 
06:08:43.190 --> 06:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is a state that values being able
 
06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
to look one another in the eye to be
 
06:08:47.430 --> 06:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
able to know who your neighbors are to
 
06:08:49.590 --> 06:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
be able to set forth the rules and
 
06:08:51.190 --> 06:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
regulations that make the most sense for
 
06:08:53.190 --> 06:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
the communities that we come from there
 
06:08:55.030 --> 06:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
is no need for a bill like this and in
 
06:08:58.548 --> 06:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
fact the intent as the bill sponsor the
 
06:09:00.470 --> 06:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman representing the bill
 
06:09:02.788 --> 06:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
clearly spoke of was about deterring
 
06:09:04.628 --> 06:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration
 
06:09:07.110 --> 06:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants
 
06:09:09.750 --> 06:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
immigration is a complex issue
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do that what it does
 
06:09:14.230 --> 06:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
is it authorizes an entire thousands of
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents including people
 
06:09:18.310 --> 06:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
like myself folks who have already sat
 
06:09:20.390 --> 06:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
here people you see very often and many
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
more that you don't see in these
 
06:09:25.110 --> 06:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
hallowed halls who are working living
 
06:09:27.590 --> 06:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
paying into the state who are acting as
 
06:09:29.590 --> 06:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
our essential workers who are keeping
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
this this country this state running
 
06:09:34.628 --> 06:09:34.638 align:start position:0%
especially now during this pandemic and
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
it is egregious and disappointing to sit
 
06:09:40.548 --> 06:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
here and listen to something that could
 
06:09:42.470 --> 06:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
pass that would undermine all of those
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
efforts that energy and that ability for
 
06:09:48.548 --> 06:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
our municipalities to regulate support
 
06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
and care for its citizens
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative roy you're recognized
 
06:09:57.510 --> 06:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:09:57.520 --> 06:09:58.628 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:09:58.638 --> 06:09:59.670 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:09:59.670 --> 06:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:02.390 --> 06:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
is it your position then that no one
 
06:10:04.390 --> 06:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:10:06.230 --> 06:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
deported from the united states who's
 
06:10:07.990 --> 06:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
entered here without the property
 
06:10:08.000 --> 06:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
entered here without the property
documentation

06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
that is an interesting take on what i
 
06:10:13.270 --> 06:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
have just said
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
there's nothing it wasn't
 
06:10:14.878 --> 06:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
there's nothing it wasn't
so

06:10:15.590 --> 06:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
like i said that is an interesting take
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
on what i've just said um that is not at
 
06:10:20.628 --> 06:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
all what i'm saying so what i am
 
06:10:22.548 --> 06:10:22.558 align:start position:0%
speaking to is the fact that immigration
 
06:10:25.110 --> 06:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
is a very complex is a very complex
 
06:10:27.270 --> 06:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
system and the problems that are found
 
06:10:29.510 --> 06:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
in immigration are very complex and the
 
06:10:31.350 --> 06:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
fact the reality is is that this country
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
deports millions of people every year
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the majority of those people
 
06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be have been deported in the
 
06:10:39.670 --> 06:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
first place and if we really want to
 
06:10:41.510 --> 06:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
solve those issues and the real question
 
06:10:43.590 --> 06:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
the question that we should be asking is
 
06:10:45.270 --> 06:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
why are people who shouldn't be getting
 
06:10:53.830 --> 06:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the impact of this
 
06:11:03.750 --> 06:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill could one of the potential impacts
 
06:11:03.760 --> 06:11:05.190 align:start position:0%
bill could one of the potential impacts
be

06:11:05.190 --> 06:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:11:05.200 --> 06:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
be
that

06:11:07.030 --> 06:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:11:07.040 --> 06:11:08.470 align:start position:0%
that
regular

06:11:08.470 --> 06:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
regular
 
06:11:10.628 --> 06:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
united states citizens who were born
 
06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
here or normalized here
 
06:11:15.590 --> 06:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
could be profiled
 
06:11:18.628 --> 06:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
and then would have to prove their
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship status and maybe have to get
 
06:11:23.270 --> 06:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody to get their birth certificate
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
out or whatever it is because as far as
 
06:11:28.830 --> 06:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
i know that's all i have that proves my
 
06:11:28.840 --> 06:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
i know that's all i have that proves my
citizenship

06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so i think
 
06:11:33.990 --> 06:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting because it it
 
06:11:35.670 --> 06:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
definitely does a bill like this
 
06:11:38.788 --> 06:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely um does create a situation
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
where profiling ends up happening
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
because what you're saying is that
 
06:11:44.150 --> 06:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
cities and municipalities who are
 
06:11:45.670 --> 06:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
recognized who have worked with their
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
communities and their citizens to say
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know when these things happen when
 
06:11:52.070 --> 06:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
lot civil law enforcement cooperates
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
with uh immigration enforcement in ways
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they don't need to is not
 
06:11:59.030 --> 06:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional nor is it illegal they
 
06:12:01.750 --> 06:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
choose not to go into um uh what is it
 
06:12:03.270 --> 06:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
called what is the word i'm looking for
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
i speak multiple languages so i speak so
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think in multiple languages um
 
06:12:11.190 --> 06:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
when they go into voluntary agreement
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
they're saying we do not want to go into
 
06:12:14.070 --> 06:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary agreements because we know
 
06:12:16.470 --> 06:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
we've done the work to understand based
 
06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
on what we have researched and what
 
06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
we've talked with with our citizens that
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
when these things happen profiling
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
happens and when profiling happens no
 
06:12:24.948 --> 06:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
one is safe and the reality is is that
 
06:12:26.470 --> 06:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
many immigrants live in mixed status
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
families my husband was born here
 
06:12:31.430 --> 06:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
um sometimes you know if he has a part
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
like a deep tan he doesn't look what you
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
would think of as american sometimes in
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
the dead of winter he does so for for
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
many of us who come from mixed status
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
families we're setting up a situation
 
06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
where a bill like this makes it so that
 
06:12:46.788 --> 06:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
there is a sense of instability and and
 
06:12:49.110 --> 06:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
not of being safe who knows if someone
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
in my family who will be profiled who
 
06:12:54.390 --> 06:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
knows if what that it matters if i have
 
06:12:56.390 --> 06:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
my i have to carry my papers with me
 
06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
every time that i go into my car other
 
06:12:59.910 --> 06:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
than my driver's license so the
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
implications of this bill is very very
 
06:13:02.638 --> 06:13:03.910 align:start position:0%
implications of this bill is very very
disturbing

06:13:03.910 --> 06:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the jury
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
may inquire with the question and thank
 
06:13:11.510 --> 06:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
06:13:13.910 --> 06:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
can you provide one example where a
 
06:13:15.910 --> 06:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
person should not have been deported but
 
06:13:15.920 --> 06:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
person should not have been deported but
was

06:13:17.750 --> 06:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
that was
 
06:13:22.310 --> 06:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm not an immigration lawyer um what
 
06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
i can say is i can provide an example of
 
06:13:26.470 --> 06:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
a community member who is whose identity
 
06:13:29.830 --> 06:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
i will keep very very private um who
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
is fighting for his life he's fighting
 
06:13:33.510 --> 06:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
to stay here
 
06:13:35.750 --> 06:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
he comes from a country where he is
 
06:13:38.230 --> 06:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely would be taken he would be
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
killed the minute he steps set foot back
 
06:13:42.948 --> 06:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
in his home country he is fighting to
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
ensure not only that he survives here
 
06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
but that the family back home that he
 
06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
has left behind the young children and
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
his wife
 
06:13:52.628 --> 06:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
who are back home will be able to move
 
06:13:54.788 --> 06:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
freely and not be constantly terrorized
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
as they have been since he set foot in
 
06:13:58.548 --> 06:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
this country seeking asylum two years
 
06:14:01.110 --> 06:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
ago now this man came with a cohort of
 
06:14:03.350 --> 06:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
other african immigrants from the same
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
country or nearby
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
and almost all of them
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
were all were able to um enter the
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
country after a period of detention or
 
06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
be able to adjust their statuses to to
 
06:14:16.548 --> 06:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
receive asylum he was the only one and
 
06:14:18.150 --> 06:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
the reason for that the difference
 
06:14:20.070 --> 06:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
between him and them
 
06:14:21.750 --> 06:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
was that he didn't know anybody in this
 
06:14:23.670 --> 06:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
country so we were talking about a
 
06:14:26.070 --> 06:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
complex immigration system that we're
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
asking the question why do people who
 
06:14:29.270 --> 06:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get deported get deported it's
 
06:14:31.030 --> 06:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
because of reasons like this
 
06:14:32.390 --> 06:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
because of small
 
06:14:32.400 --> 06:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
because of small
specific

06:14:33.590 --> 06:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
06:14:35.830 --> 06:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
very granular rules
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:43.030 --> 06:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my question if i
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
can ask for the follow-up
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
so the immigration i mean that's that's
 
06:14:48.390 --> 06:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
a federal law
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
issue that's going on i suppose my
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
question is
 
06:14:54.150 --> 06:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
is if we were able to have any type of
 
06:14:55.830 --> 06:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
immigration reform how would we do that
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
if we don't enforce
 
06:14:58.948 --> 06:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
the immigration laws whether the current
 
06:15:01.270 --> 06:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
laws or whatever we were to reform the
 
06:15:03.030 --> 06:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
federal law too
 
06:15:04.708 --> 06:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
so there's not enough time for me to
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
give a history lesson um but i think one
 
06:15:08.708 --> 06:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
thing that's important to note is that
 
06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
immigration law has changed drastically
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the last two to three decades so i'm
 
06:15:15.990 --> 06:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
34 years old almost 35 years old and the
 
06:15:17.750 --> 06:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
way that immigration law was set up when
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
i was two compared to the now being in
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
my mid-30s is very different and so what
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
we have is that we have set up our laws
 
06:15:28.628 --> 06:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
exponentially administration after
 
06:15:30.868 --> 06:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
administration to become even more
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
punitive to be to catch more people to
 
06:15:35.110 --> 06:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
criminalize them to label them as
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
criminals to find reasons to put them in
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
detention deportation um and and close
 
06:15:42.310 --> 06:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
them out from being able to come into
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
this country so we have already done
 
06:15:46.230 --> 06:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
that we have done we have set up a
 
06:15:49.350 --> 06:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
system that is focused almost entirely
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
on punishment detention and deportation
 
06:15:53.590 --> 06:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
instead of what the system was
 
06:15:55.510 --> 06:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
originally set up to do which is to
 
06:15:55.520 --> 06:15:56.548 align:start position:0%
originally set up to do which is to
serve

06:15:56.548 --> 06:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
serve
 
06:15:58.470 --> 06:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
which is to understand why people are
 
06:16:00.948 --> 06:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
coming and then to sir and to figure out
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
what is the best way to process them
 
06:16:04.628 --> 06:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
while maintaining their humanity so
 
06:16:05.910 --> 06:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
again the real question that we should
 
06:16:07.430 --> 06:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
be asking with the question that you've
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
asked chairman is that we how can we
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
build a system that uplifts that not
 
06:16:14.708 --> 06:16:14.718 align:start position:0%
only lives up to the values that we have
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
as a country but serves the original
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
values of the ways that it was intended
 
06:16:20.948 --> 06:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
when it was first built and and also
 
06:16:22.708 --> 06:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
noting the fact as my colleague bruno
 
06:16:24.788 --> 06:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
said before a certain point we didn't
 
06:16:26.788 --> 06:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
have immigration system the way that we
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
do now and certainly if we've designed
 
06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
it to be one way we can design it to be
 
06:16:30.558 --> 06:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
it to be one way we can design it to be
another

06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:39.030 --> 06:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you the witness is excused
 
06:16:41.030 --> 06:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:16:51.350 --> 06:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
06:16:55.030 --> 06:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
06:16:56.868 --> 06:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
maggie fogarty i'm the new hampshire
 
06:16:58.470 --> 06:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
program director for the american
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
friends service committee and i'm here
 
06:17:02.868 --> 06:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
today to speak on behalf of the new
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire immigrant rights network which
 
06:17:08.868 --> 06:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
is a statewide coalition of
 
06:17:12.310 --> 06:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
individuals organizations faith leaders
 
06:17:12.320 --> 06:17:13.590 align:start position:0%
individuals organizations faith leaders
attorneys

06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
06:17:16.628 --> 06:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
working together to advocate for humane
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
immigration policies
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
certainly at the federal level which is
 
06:17:22.548 --> 06:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
where our immigration policies primarily
 
06:17:22.558 --> 06:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
where our immigration policies primarily
are

06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:17:25.190 --> 06:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
but also at the state and municipal
 
06:17:27.270 --> 06:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
level because policies are made there
 
06:17:30.230 --> 06:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
which impact immigrant communities
 
06:17:32.310 --> 06:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
and i have testimony to submit to you in
 
06:17:34.470 --> 06:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
the interest of time i will just lift up
 
06:17:36.470 --> 06:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
a few key points and then i'm happy to
 
06:17:38.788 --> 06:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
we are in strong opposition to hb 1266
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
we believe this bill is anathema to new
 
06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire's principles of equity and
 
06:17:48.400 --> 06:17:49.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire's principles of equity and
justice

06:17:49.910 --> 06:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
justice
 
06:17:51.910 --> 06:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
it is unnecessary
 
06:17:55.270 --> 06:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
confusing and vague
 
06:17:57.350 --> 06:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
if passed this bill will cause
 
06:17:59.590 --> 06:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
widespread confusion
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
and result in the violation of new
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents constitutional and
 
06:18:07.510 --> 06:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
civil rights and will expose local and
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
state officials to liability
 
06:18:13.590 --> 06:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
it also interferes with the independence
 
06:18:17.910 --> 06:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
as has been discussed immigration
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence is carried out exclusively
 
06:18:24.470 --> 06:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
within the federal domain
 
06:18:26.868 --> 06:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
mostly within the administrative civil
 
06:18:26.878 --> 06:18:28.390 align:start position:0%
mostly within the administrative civil
process

06:18:28.390 --> 06:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:18:31.270 --> 06:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a full complement of
 
06:18:33.270 --> 06:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement agencies
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
operating within our borders
 
06:18:37.270 --> 06:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
including immigration enforcement
 
06:18:40.310 --> 06:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
divisions there is simply no need for
 
06:18:43.990 --> 06:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
state laws or resources to be diverted
 
06:18:46.548 --> 06:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
toward immigration enforcement or to
 
06:18:50.230 --> 06:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
targeting immigrant communities
 
06:18:52.708 --> 06:18:52.718 align:start position:0%
it is clear that the state and local
 
06:18:54.868 --> 06:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
government authorities already have
 
06:18:57.110 --> 06:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
obligations to comply with state and
 
06:18:58.468 --> 06:18:58.478 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
06:19:00.948 --> 06:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
so this bill does nothing to
 
06:19:00.958 --> 06:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
so this bill does nothing to
to

06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:19:04.468 --> 06:19:04.478 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
06:19:06.548 --> 06:19:06.558 align:start position:0%
the vagueness of this bill leaves it to
 
06:19:08.788 --> 06:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
government officials to figure out how
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
such a law would apply in actuality
 
06:19:15.830 --> 06:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
fear and anxiety about the presence of
 
06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
immigrants in our communities has been
 
06:19:20.468 --> 06:19:20.478 align:start position:0%
fanned by legislation like this
 
06:19:23.830 --> 06:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
and contributes to a rise in hate and
 
06:19:23.840 --> 06:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
and contributes to a rise in hate and
injustice

06:19:25.990 --> 06:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
injustice
 
06:19:28.628 --> 06:19:28.638 align:start position:0%
national anti-immigrant organizations
 
06:19:31.190 --> 06:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
such as the federation for american
 
06:19:34.150 --> 06:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
immigration reform fair have been a
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
significant factor in crafting
 
06:19:39.270 --> 06:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
anti-immigrant laws throughout the u.s
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
they were clearly involved in a very
 
06:19:45.030 --> 06:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
similar bill last year h.b 266 and quite
 
06:19:47.270 --> 06:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
possibly involved in the creation of
 
06:19:49.830 --> 06:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
this very similar one
 
06:19:52.230 --> 06:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
our legislature should not be influenced
 
06:19:54.548 --> 06:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
by anti-immigrant sentiments
 
06:19:56.628 --> 06:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
we should be enacting laws that protect
 
06:20:01.190 --> 06:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.390 --> 06:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
hb 1266 is particularly pernicious
 
06:20:07.350 --> 06:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
because it's designed to raise fear and
 
06:20:10.150 --> 06:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
confusion within immigrant communities
 
06:20:12.070 --> 06:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
its vagueness will contribute to
 
06:20:15.030 --> 06:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
uneasiness as it's unknown how it would
 
06:20:18.150 --> 06:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
affect all interactions between people
 
06:20:20.310 --> 06:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
perceived to be immigrants and
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
government officials government programs
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
community organizations
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
immigrant families may refrain from
 
06:20:29.670 --> 06:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
interactions with law enforcement or
 
06:20:32.070 --> 06:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
participation in programs and activities
 
06:20:34.468 --> 06:20:34.478 align:start position:0%
to which they are fully entitled for
 
06:20:36.070 --> 06:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
fear of how this law is being
 
06:20:36.080 --> 06:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
fear of how this law is being
interpreted

06:20:39.510 --> 06:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:42.868 --> 06:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
if enacted hb 1266 would trigger the
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
risk of increased racial and ethnic
 
06:20:48.548 --> 06:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
profiling animosity and distrust of
 
06:20:51.030 --> 06:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
those perceived to be immigrants and it
 
06:20:53.030 --> 06:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't take a lot of imagination to
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
know what kind of data is used to
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
perceive someone to be an immigrant
 
06:21:00.070 --> 06:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
people of color will be targeted by this
 
06:21:00.080 --> 06:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
people of color will be targeted by this
bill

06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:21:03.990 --> 06:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
so for all of these reasons we urge you
 
06:21:05.910 --> 06:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
to find this bill inexpedient to
 
06:21:08.548 --> 06:21:08.558 align:start position:0%
legislate as a resident of dover a
 
06:21:12.070 --> 06:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
community with a wonderful immigrant
 
06:21:14.230 --> 06:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
community within that community our
 
06:21:18.390 --> 06:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
local police have enacted a practice of
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
not seeking to determine the immigration
 
06:21:22.390 --> 06:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
status of someone they encounter in
 
06:21:24.310 --> 06:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
their normal course of business and it
 
06:21:25.990 --> 06:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
has made our community stronger and more
 
06:21:30.150 --> 06:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:31.590 --> 06:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
06:21:32.868 --> 06:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
06:21:34.708 --> 06:21:34.718 align:start position:0%
question um
 
06:21:37.350 --> 06:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
and and i i agree with you i think um
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
our country is made richer for
 
06:21:42.150 --> 06:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
the for our immigration but i am
 
06:21:42.160 --> 06:21:43.510 align:start position:0%
the for our immigration but i am
confused

06:21:43.510 --> 06:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
confused
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
because we also made richer because
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
we're a nation of laws
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
this bill as i read it i can't see where
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
it directs law enforcement to do
 
06:21:54.468 --> 06:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
anything other than
 
06:21:54.478 --> 06:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
anything other than
not

06:21:55.270 --> 06:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
thwart federal immigration
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to say something i want you
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
to tell me if i'm incorrect it
 
06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
right now in a sanctuary city if someone
 
06:22:08.310 --> 06:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
is arrested and they when they're put
 
06:22:10.070 --> 06:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
into the system as everybody is no
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
matter their immigration status
 
06:22:14.468 --> 06:22:14.478 align:start position:0%
if there's an ice detainer it pops up
 
06:22:16.628 --> 06:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
ice detainer
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
this law would say that they do have to
 
06:22:21.510 --> 06:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
notify ice that they have that person in
 
06:22:23.830 --> 06:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
custody it doesn't say that they have to
 
06:22:26.150 --> 06:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
go out and start asking immigration
 
06:22:29.190 --> 06:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
status questions or stopping people
 
06:22:29.200 --> 06:22:30.788 align:start position:0%
status questions or stopping people
so

06:22:30.788 --> 06:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
is that correct or am i reading it wrong
 
06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
i think you're reading it generously
 
06:22:37.510 --> 06:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
i think that there's that the language
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
in this bill is so vague and inclusive
 
06:22:40.718 --> 06:22:41.590 align:start position:0%
in this bill is so vague and inclusive
that

06:22:41.590 --> 06:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
that not doing
 
06:22:47.750 --> 06:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
not acting as immigration enforcement
 
06:22:50.390 --> 06:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
agents could be perceived as not
 
06:22:52.948 --> 06:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
cooperating with federal immigration
 
06:22:54.868 --> 06:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
laws so the issue pertaining to
 
06:22:56.708 --> 06:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
detainers attorney clementos who's
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
coming after attorney debrito spoke to
 
06:23:01.910 --> 06:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the fact that those are already
 
06:23:04.150 --> 06:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledged among law enforcement
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
officers they have a duty of cooperation
 
06:23:08.230 --> 06:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
but this bill is written in such a way
 
06:23:10.390 --> 06:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
to capture all sorts of other
 
06:23:12.468 --> 06:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
behaviors that would
 
06:23:14.788 --> 06:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
easily be interpreted to be required
 
06:23:18.230 --> 06:23:18.240 align:start position:0%

06:23:36.628 --> 06:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and it it it just cites

that all immigrants are criminal aliens
 
06:23:43.350 --> 06:23:43.360 align:start position:0%

06:24:02.468 --> 06:24:02.478 align:start position:0%

section 805 maintaining order in

06:24:29.350 --> 06:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
um it is within the discretionary
 
06:24:32.070 --> 06:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
capacity of a presiding officer of a
 
06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislative body to insist upon the
 
06:24:36.628 --> 06:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
orderly recognition of speakers and to
 
06:24:39.350 --> 06:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
make quick judgments as to what method
 
06:24:41.510 --> 06:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
to use to maintain order at emotionally
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
so your point of order is that the
 
06:24:52.230 --> 06:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony submitted by a member
 
06:24:54.548 --> 06:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
of the public
 
06:24:54.558 --> 06:24:55.830 align:start position:0%
of the public
is

06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:24:57.430 --> 06:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
not income
 
06:24:57.440 --> 06:24:58.948 align:start position:0%
not income
violates

06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
violates
 
06:25:02.070 --> 06:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
rule 805
 
06:25:05.190 --> 06:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
well it it's it's inappropriate and it's
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
within our power to strike it
 
06:25:09.670 --> 06:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
as it
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
so you're asking that you're destroy i'm
 
06:25:13.110 --> 06:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
not going to strike any of the written
 
06:25:13.120 --> 06:25:14.390 align:start position:0%
not going to strike any of the written
testimony

06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:25:14.400 --> 06:25:15.190 align:start position:0%
testimony
uh

06:25:15.190 --> 06:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:17.030 --> 06:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
submitted by any members of the public
 
06:25:18.390 --> 06:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it to entrust the members of
 
06:25:21.030 --> 06:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
the committee to
 
06:25:23.510 --> 06:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
evaluate and take into consideration
 
06:25:25.350 --> 06:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
that written testimony i also have not
 
06:25:27.270 --> 06:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
read the written testimony yet so
 
06:25:29.110 --> 06:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
i would have to do that in order i'm not
 
06:25:29.120 --> 06:25:29.910 align:start position:0%
i would have to do that in order i'm not
gonna

06:25:29.910 --> 06:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
06:25:31.510 --> 06:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
make that ruling right now
 
06:25:33.830 --> 06:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
i have a question of the chair
 
06:25:35.350 --> 06:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's the ruling of the chair i
 
06:25:36.628 --> 06:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
will but while we're sitting here we'll
 
06:25:38.150 --> 06:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at the testing i have
 
06:25:39.670 --> 06:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's a you know you don't need to get
 
06:25:39.680 --> 06:25:40.468 align:start position:0%
there's a you know you don't need to get
up

06:25:40.468 --> 06:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
up
 
06:25:42.628 --> 06:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
there's a copy right here the
 
06:25:44.708 --> 06:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
my clerk sitting to my left just uh
 
06:25:47.190 --> 06:25:47.200 align:start position:0%

wondering how i could get one of those
books

06:25:56.310 --> 06:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:00.628 --> 06:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.548 --> 06:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this is this is
 
06:26:02.558 --> 06:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this is this is
borrowing

06:26:09.110 --> 06:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:10.468 --> 06:26:10.478 align:start position:0%
actually i will take up on the off that
 
06:26:19.350 --> 06:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:20.468 --> 06:26:20.478 align:start position:0%
let me read the first one then we'll
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
worry about the second one
 
06:26:23.590 --> 06:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
but we want to keep the
 
06:26:26.070 --> 06:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
members of the public while we talk
 
06:26:27.510 --> 06:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves was keep the hearing
 
06:26:27.520 --> 06:26:29.910 align:start position:0%

06:26:31.830 --> 06:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman is this the appropriate time
 
06:26:34.150 --> 06:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
for this no that's why i want to move on
 
06:26:39.670 --> 06:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:41.510 --> 06:26:41.520 align:start position:0%

i'm a senior staff attorney at the
 
06:27:06.628 --> 06:27:06.638 align:start position:0%
american civil liberties union of new
 
06:27:06.638 --> 06:27:07.670 align:start position:0%
american civil liberties union of new
hampshire

06:27:07.670 --> 06:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:27:10.070 --> 06:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'm here today testifying in lieu of our
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
legal director geolog who wishes that he
 
06:27:13.750 --> 06:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
could be here with you today and sends
 
06:27:16.150 --> 06:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
his regrets he had emailed you some
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
written remarks that i plan on
 
06:27:19.270 --> 06:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
expounding upon
 
06:27:19.280 --> 06:27:20.070 align:start position:0%
expounding upon
so

06:27:20.070 --> 06:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:27:21.670 --> 06:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
i want to start with what
 
06:27:22.948 --> 06:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
let me start by saying that we're
 
06:27:25.350 --> 06:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to this bill
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh and then move on to what i think are
 
06:27:29.510 --> 06:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
a few drafting errors with the bill
 
06:27:29.520 --> 06:27:30.628 align:start position:0%
a few drafting errors with the bill
um

06:27:30.628 --> 06:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
so the first of which is that this bill
 
06:27:34.150 --> 06:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
would prohibit
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
judicial officers from acting in a way
 
06:27:38.310 --> 06:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
which restrict or discourage the
 
06:27:40.230 --> 06:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal immigration laws
 
06:27:41.350 --> 06:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
06:27:42.948 --> 06:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
this branch of government telling a
 
06:27:44.708 --> 06:27:44.718 align:start position:0%
judicial officer what they can or can't
 
06:27:47.110 --> 06:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
do raises serious separation of powers
 
06:27:47.120 --> 06:27:48.230 align:start position:0%
do raises serious separation of powers
concerns

06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:27:48.240 --> 06:27:49.030 align:start position:0%
concerns
um

06:27:49.030 --> 06:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:50.390 --> 06:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
06:27:52.948 --> 06:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
this bill by acting upon any appointed
 
06:27:54.788 --> 06:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
or elected official
 
06:27:56.948 --> 06:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
could be construed as prohibiting
 
06:27:58.628 --> 06:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
members of this body
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
from advocating in any particular way in
 
06:28:03.350 --> 06:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
violation of the state constitution's
 
06:28:05.110 --> 06:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
speech and debate clause
 
06:28:06.788 --> 06:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to become law could
 
06:28:06.798 --> 06:28:07.910 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to become law could
arguably

06:28:07.910 --> 06:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
arguably
 
06:28:10.628 --> 06:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh prohibit a future legislature from
 
06:28:12.548 --> 06:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
moving to repeal this bill
 
06:28:15.030 --> 06:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
because they would be elected officials
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh adopting a policy to restrict or
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
discourage the enforcement of federal
 
06:28:21.270 --> 06:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and and obviously this
 
06:28:22.708 --> 06:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
legislature can't bind future
 
06:28:24.548 --> 06:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
legislatures and i think it would be
 
06:28:26.150 --> 06:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
a violation of the speech and debate
 
06:28:28.868 --> 06:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
clause for it to to criminalize or or
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
make illegal remarks of members of this
 
06:28:34.468 --> 06:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
next i think hb 1266
 
06:28:41.190 --> 06:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
could require municipalities to violate
 
06:28:43.830 --> 06:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
the fourth and 14th amendments of the us
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
constitution as well as
 
06:28:48.548 --> 06:28:48.558 align:start position:0%
part 1 article 19 of the new hampshire
 
06:28:51.830 --> 06:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
constitution by potentially requiring
 
06:28:53.750 --> 06:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
police departments to seize people
 
06:28:55.670 --> 06:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
without probable cause
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
so an ice detainer is different from a
 
06:29:00.708 --> 06:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
typical arrest warrant in that it's not
 
06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily supported by a probable
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
cause nor is it reviewed and issued by a
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
neutral and detached magistrate so an
 
06:29:09.510 --> 06:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
arrest warrant
 
06:29:11.030 --> 06:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has to be issued by a
 
06:29:11.040 --> 06:29:12.390 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has to be issued by a
judge

06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
judge
 
06:29:13.910 --> 06:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
a member of the judicial branch whereas
 
06:29:15.590 --> 06:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
an ice detainer
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
does not and so uh courts across the
 
06:29:21.350 --> 06:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
across the country have found that
 
06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
police departments seizing
 
06:29:23.440 --> 06:29:24.468 align:start position:0%
police departments seizing
um

06:29:24.468 --> 06:29:24.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:26.230 --> 06:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
people on the basis of immigration
 
06:29:28.628 --> 06:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
detainers opera issued by ice have
 
06:29:28.638 --> 06:29:29.910 align:start position:0%
detainers opera issued by ice have
violated

06:29:29.910 --> 06:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
violated
 
06:29:32.390 --> 06:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
similar state constitutional provisions
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
because they're effectively making an
 
06:29:36.868 --> 06:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
arrest without probable cause or a
 
06:29:38.868 --> 06:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
neutral and detached magistrate's arrest
 
06:29:38.878 --> 06:29:39.750 align:start position:0%
neutral and detached magistrate's arrest
warrant

06:29:39.750 --> 06:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
06:29:42.070 --> 06:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i'd direct you to footnote 4 in our
 
06:29:45.110 --> 06:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:48.230 --> 06:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.990 --> 06:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
in response to a question from
 
06:29:51.590 --> 06:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative lang to another witness
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
as to whether
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
it would be a good policy to permit
 
06:29:58.390 --> 06:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
a subdivision of the state to enact its
 
06:30:00.628 --> 06:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
own rules in terms of how it wants to
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws i would say to you
 
06:30:05.830 --> 06:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
that currently police departments
 
06:30:08.070 --> 06:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
and prosecutors offices
 
06:30:10.390 --> 06:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
exercise prosecutorial discretion in all
 
06:30:12.150 --> 06:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
manner of ways and for all manner of
 
06:30:13.830 --> 06:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
reasons so
 
06:30:16.230 --> 06:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
for example a police department a police
 
06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
officer may see someone jaywalking
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's a violation of the law but they
 
06:30:21.910 --> 06:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
may decide to issue someone a written
 
06:30:24.708 --> 06:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
warning or a verbal warning rather than
 
06:30:27.110 --> 06:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
a citation or an arrest and that's the
 
06:30:29.190 --> 06:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
type of discretion that's
 
06:30:31.670 --> 06:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
best left to local control
 
06:30:33.510 --> 06:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so i'd refer you to a case that we
 
06:30:33.520 --> 06:30:34.548 align:start position:0%
and so i'd refer you to a case that we
had

06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
had
 
06:30:36.468 --> 06:30:36.478 align:start position:0%
where we represented a man who was
 
06:30:39.350 --> 06:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
seized by the exeter police department
 
06:30:41.670 --> 06:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
in i think unusual circumstances so he
 
06:30:41.680 --> 06:30:42.468 align:start position:0%
in i think unusual circumstances so he
was

06:30:42.468 --> 06:30:42.478 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:30:44.708 --> 06:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
an undocumented person who was working
 
06:30:46.390 --> 06:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
at a convenience store
 
06:30:48.230 --> 06:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
when a woman in the convenience store
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
had reported that she had been
 
06:30:52.548 --> 06:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
unwantedly kissed and the police
 
06:30:52.558 --> 06:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
unwantedly kissed and the police
responded

06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
responded
 
06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they they
 
06:30:57.510 --> 06:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
figure out who the suspect is and they
 
06:30:59.030 --> 06:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
go to try to talk to that person and he
 
06:31:00.868 --> 06:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak english and so our client
 
06:31:00.878 --> 06:31:01.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak english and so our client
who

06:31:01.670 --> 06:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
was not the suspect but also worked at
 
06:31:05.990 --> 06:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
the store offers to translate for the
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
exeter police department and he does
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
that and in fact enables the exeter
 
06:31:11.270 --> 06:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
police department to assist their
 
06:31:11.280 --> 06:31:12.788 align:start position:0%
police department to assist their
investigation

06:31:12.788 --> 06:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
06:31:15.030 --> 06:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
after that the exeter police department
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
asks him what his immigration status is
 
06:31:18.788 --> 06:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
and he answers truthfully that he's out
 
06:31:21.510 --> 06:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
of status and is arrested
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
for my money that's a pretty good
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
example of
 
06:31:24.798 --> 06:31:25.910 align:start position:0%
example of
how

06:31:25.910 --> 06:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:31:27.990 --> 06:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
instituting a blanket policy that every
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
person who comes into contact with the
 
06:31:32.070 --> 06:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
police has to answer questions about
 
06:31:33.910 --> 06:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
their immigration status could
 
06:31:33.920 --> 06:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
their immigration status could
discourage

06:31:35.110 --> 06:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
discourage
 
06:31:37.910 --> 06:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
witnesses to crimes victims of crime
 
06:31:39.270 --> 06:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
from cooperating with the police and
 
06:31:41.110 --> 06:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
could make them feel less safe and i
 
06:31:43.350 --> 06:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
would put to this committee that
 
06:31:45.670 --> 06:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
whether and how to enforce those those
 
06:31:47.190 --> 06:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
immigration laws that are really
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
primarily the subject of the federal
 
06:31:52.150 --> 06:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
domain is best left to the locality that
 
06:31:55.190 --> 06:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
knows those issues the best
 
06:31:57.190 --> 06:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to
 
06:31:58.868 --> 06:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
answer a couple questions that the chair
 
06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
had asked of a prior speaker
 
06:32:02.708 --> 06:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
mr chairman one of the questions you had
 
06:32:05.430 --> 06:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
asked was how would a
 
06:32:07.830 --> 06:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
lawful immigrant be negatively impacted
 
06:32:14.070 --> 06:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:15.270 --> 06:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to your testimony i don't
 
06:32:16.708 --> 06:32:16.718 align:start position:0%
believe i asked the chair does not
 
06:32:18.708 --> 06:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
recall asking that question
 
06:32:20.230 --> 06:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
i mean you may you may speak as i may be
 
06:32:21.910 --> 06:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
kind of hypothetical
 
06:32:23.350 --> 06:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing i thought the question was
 
06:32:24.788 --> 06:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
how could
 
06:32:24.798 --> 06:32:25.990 align:start position:0%
how could
um

06:32:25.990 --> 06:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:27.030 --> 06:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
a person
 
06:32:28.948 --> 06:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
who who was
 
06:32:30.788 --> 06:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
lawfully in this country
 
06:32:32.390 --> 06:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
how could they be negatively impacted by
 
06:32:33.670 --> 06:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of federal immigration
 
06:32:35.510 --> 06:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
laws but
 
06:32:37.190 --> 06:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
direct the question to you assistant
 
06:32:39.110 --> 06:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
witness i ask that if some
 
06:32:40.948 --> 06:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
what is the concern with
 
06:32:41.910 --> 06:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
having a
 
06:32:44.468 --> 06:32:44.478 align:start position:0%
system where a person lawfully enters
 
06:32:46.708 --> 06:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
the united states of america but they're
 
06:32:48.390 --> 06:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
not what what is the opposition or
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
objection to then enforcing those those
 
06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
same laws that allow them to come
 
06:32:53.270 --> 06:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
illegally in the first place but then
 
06:32:55.350 --> 06:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to enforce the other
 
06:32:57.110 --> 06:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
06:33:00.230 --> 06:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um and and i'd uh refer
 
06:33:01.670 --> 06:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to put out two
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
of our written testimony which says that
 
06:33:05.750 --> 06:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
according to isis own records between
 
06:33:09.910 --> 06:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2008 and 2012 it erroneously
 
06:33:12.868 --> 06:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
issued 834 immigration detainers against
 
06:33:14.708 --> 06:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
united states citizens
 
06:33:17.350 --> 06:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
and 28 489
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
immigration detainers against lawful
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
permanent records uh residents so the
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
point is that that ice makes mistakes
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
and people who are lawfully in this
 
06:33:26.788 --> 06:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
country can nonetheless be negatively
 
06:33:28.548 --> 06:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
impacted by the enforcement of the
 
06:33:29.990 --> 06:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
06:33:32.230 --> 06:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
the other question
 
06:33:34.070 --> 06:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the chair had asked was to point
 
06:33:35.190 --> 06:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
him to
 
06:33:37.270 --> 06:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
a person who has been deported who
 
06:33:38.708 --> 06:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been we represented a
 
06:33:42.230 --> 06:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
person who was in removal proceedings
 
06:33:45.030 --> 06:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
and had raised defenses to removal on
 
06:33:46.468 --> 06:33:46.478 align:start position:0%
the basis of the convention against
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
torture and other
 
06:33:48.000 --> 06:33:49.430 align:start position:0%
torture and other
associated

06:33:49.430 --> 06:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
associated
 
06:33:51.270 --> 06:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
laws which are basically defenses to
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
immigration and
 
06:33:54.708 --> 06:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
after his case had been accepted for
 
06:33:57.590 --> 06:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
review from the bia to the first circuit
 
06:33:59.110 --> 06:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
the first circuit court of appeals had
 
06:34:01.670 --> 06:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
issued a stay of his removal
 
06:34:03.590 --> 06:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
and nonetheless the government deported
 
06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
him in violation of that stay causing
 
06:34:08.390 --> 06:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
him to spend
 
06:34:10.548 --> 06:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
over six months in a salvador in prison
 
06:34:10.558 --> 06:34:11.350 align:start position:0%
over six months in a salvador in prison
where

06:34:11.350 --> 06:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:34:12.708 --> 06:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
conditions are
 
06:34:15.190 --> 06:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
sort of as you'd imagine and that led to
 
06:34:17.430 --> 06:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
a round of briefing at the first circuit
 
06:34:18.788 --> 06:34:18.798 align:start position:0%
as to whether the attorney general or
 
06:34:20.468 --> 06:34:20.478 align:start position:0%
secretary of homeland security should be
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
held in contempt of court
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
people who are out of status
 
06:34:31.110 --> 06:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
may be victims of crimes they may be
 
06:34:32.708 --> 06:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
witnesses to crimes
 
06:34:36.868 --> 06:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
and allowing a local police department
 
06:34:39.830 --> 06:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
to enact policies or procedures that
 
06:34:42.070 --> 06:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
allow them to take into account the
 
06:34:44.070 --> 06:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
complex realities of the communities
 
06:34:46.390 --> 06:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
that they're sworn to protect
 
06:34:46.400 --> 06:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
that they're sworn to protect
preserves

06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
preserves
 
06:34:49.510 --> 06:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
local control which is i think a
 
06:34:51.830 --> 06:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
well-established new hampshire value
 
06:34:54.230 --> 06:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
and inclusion to the community by
 
06:34:56.070 --> 06:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
allowing people regardless of
 
06:34:58.150 --> 06:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
immigration status to feel safe
 
06:35:00.070 --> 06:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
reporting illegal acts that they say to
 
06:35:01.910 --> 06:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
the police so that
 
06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony
 
06:35:06.628 --> 06:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
06:35:09.350 --> 06:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
06:35:12.150 --> 06:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
as an attorney
 
06:35:19.270 --> 06:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
is it is it your opinion that it's good
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
policy to allow localities let's leave
 
06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
immigration out of this is it is a good
 
06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
policy to allow localities to decide
 
06:35:27.520 --> 06:35:28.390 align:start position:0%
policy to allow localities to decide
which

06:35:28.390 --> 06:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
06:35:30.548 --> 06:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
laws they will and which laws they will
 
06:35:32.230 --> 06:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
not comply with from the federal
 
06:35:32.240 --> 06:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
not comply with from the federal
government

06:35:34.390 --> 06:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:35:36.390 --> 06:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
so i think what i would say is as an
 
06:35:36.400 --> 06:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
so i think what i would say is as an
attorney

06:35:37.910 --> 06:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
06:35:40.468 --> 06:35:40.478 align:start position:0%
immigration law is the exclusive domain
 
06:35:43.590 --> 06:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the federal government and our system
 
06:35:44.948 --> 06:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
of government in new hampshire is such
 
06:35:46.628 --> 06:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
that generally
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
localities are free to use their own
 
06:35:51.990 --> 06:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
resources the way that they best see fit
 
06:35:54.310 --> 06:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i think in general allowing police
 
06:35:56.628 --> 06:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
departments absent some overriding
 
06:35:56.638 --> 06:35:57.750 align:start position:0%
departments absent some overriding
concern

06:35:57.750 --> 06:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
concern
 
06:35:57.760 --> 06:35:58.628 align:start position:0%
concern
to

06:35:58.628 --> 06:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:36:00.390 --> 06:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
determine the best ways to police their
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
communities is good policy quick
 
06:36:04.948 --> 06:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
06:36:06.548 --> 06:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
um recognize for a follow-up thank you
 
06:36:09.110 --> 06:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm referring specifically
 
06:36:09.120 --> 06:36:10.310 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm referring specifically
to

06:36:10.310 --> 06:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:36:13.750 --> 06:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
to detainers uh i agree totally please
 
06:36:15.270 --> 06:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
local police should not be enforcing
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
06:36:21.270 --> 06:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:23.350 --> 06:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
should localities be able to instruct
 
06:36:25.110 --> 06:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
their police departments
 
06:36:28.468 --> 06:36:28.478 align:start position:0%
do not comply with federal detainers
 
06:36:28.478 --> 06:36:29.430 align:start position:0%
do not comply with federal detainers
um

06:36:29.430 --> 06:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:31.350 --> 06:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
because it's a federal law
 
06:36:33.670 --> 06:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
should we be doing that in the same
 
06:36:37.430 --> 06:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
veins should we also maybe perhaps say
 
06:36:38.948 --> 06:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
ignore the second amendment laws from
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government we have our own
 
06:36:41.750 --> 06:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
06:36:43.990 --> 06:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
06:36:45.430 --> 06:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
i guess the best way to answer that is
 
06:36:47.430 --> 06:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
that courts across the state across the
 
06:36:50.070 --> 06:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
country have found that local police
 
06:36:52.070 --> 06:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
officers violate their state
 
06:36:54.390 --> 06:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
constitutions by arresting someone on
 
06:36:56.548 --> 06:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
the basis of an ice detainer because an
 
06:36:59.110 --> 06:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
ice detainer is not an arrest warrant
 
06:37:00.788 --> 06:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
issued based on probable cause and
 
06:37:02.230 --> 06:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
issued by a neutral and detached
 
06:37:04.390 --> 06:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
magistrate and so
 
06:37:06.390 --> 06:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire a police officer is not
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
free to generally make an arrest
 
06:37:10.070 --> 06:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
except in limited circumstances when
 
06:37:11.990 --> 06:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
they have a warrant or when a felony is
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
committed in their presence and they
 
06:37:15.910 --> 06:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
have probable cause to believe that
 
06:37:19.590 --> 06:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
right um i think that a locality could
 
06:37:21.590 --> 06:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
easily look at those cases that we cite
 
06:37:22.628 --> 06:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
in footnote four of our written
 
06:37:24.310 --> 06:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and determined that they may
 
06:37:26.548 --> 06:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
be opening themselves up to liability
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
for violating someone's state
 
06:37:30.310 --> 06:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights by using state
 
06:37:31.590 --> 06:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
actors who are
 
06:37:31.600 --> 06:37:32.468 align:start position:0%
actors who are
not

06:37:32.468 --> 06:37:32.478 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:37:35.190 --> 06:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
authorized explicitly by federal law to
 
06:37:37.030 --> 06:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
enforce these immigration detainers and
 
06:37:38.310 --> 06:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
thus may be violating the state
 
06:37:39.830 --> 06:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of someone so i
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
guess i'd say
 
06:37:43.270 --> 06:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
it is good policy to allow
 
06:37:44.708 --> 06:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
police departments to make their own
 
06:37:44.718 --> 06:37:45.910 align:start position:0%
police departments to make their own
judgment

06:37:45.910 --> 06:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
06:37:47.910 --> 06:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
and avoid violating state constitutional
 
06:37:49.590 --> 06:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
rights of people
 
06:37:49.600 --> 06:37:50.830 align:start position:0%
rights of people
thank

06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
you representative lange
 
06:37:54.868 --> 06:37:54.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:37:56.628 --> 06:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
my question so i want to go back to this
 
06:37:58.948 --> 06:37:58.958 align:start position:0%
idea this concept of public policy and
 
06:37:58.958 --> 06:37:59.670 align:start position:0%
idea this concept of public policy and
and

06:37:59.670 --> 06:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:38:01.510 --> 06:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
ignoring laws
 
06:38:03.270 --> 06:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
so i i guess
 
06:38:05.590 --> 06:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
if the city of concord here decided to
 
06:38:07.110 --> 06:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
pass and say
 
06:38:09.670 --> 06:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
the city of concord police department
 
06:38:11.990 --> 06:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
which is funded by the cities cannot
 
06:38:14.468 --> 06:38:14.478 align:start position:0%
assist ice in any immigration laws and
 
06:38:15.990 --> 06:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
then ice shows up the doorstep to the
 
06:38:17.750 --> 06:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
local police department and says
 
06:38:19.910 --> 06:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
we've done an investigation we have a we
 
06:38:21.830 --> 06:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
want to go raid this house or this
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
location and concord pd says now i'm not
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to do that we can't i'm not
 
06:38:28.468 --> 06:38:28.478 align:start position:0%
allowed to and puts those ins officers
 
06:38:30.310 --> 06:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
at risk in a community they don't know
 
06:38:32.628 --> 06:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
do you think that's good policy
 
06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
06:38:35.590 --> 06:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
number one that i don't i'm not aware of
 
06:38:37.270 --> 06:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
any police department saying that we
 
06:38:39.910 --> 06:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
would not provide that kind of courtesy
 
06:38:41.990 --> 06:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
for an arrest warrant raid being taken
 
06:38:43.510 --> 06:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
by federal partners i think what we're
 
06:38:46.708 --> 06:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
talking about more specifically is
 
06:38:48.548 --> 06:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
more likely is a town or police
 
06:38:50.468 --> 06:38:50.478 align:start position:0%
department saying we have a policy of
 
06:38:51.990 --> 06:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
just not asking people what their
 
06:38:54.468 --> 06:38:54.478 align:start position:0%
immigration status is i think that is
 
06:38:56.070 --> 06:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
good policy
 
06:38:56.080 --> 06:38:58.708 align:start position:0%
good policy
follow

06:38:58.708 --> 06:38:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:04.390 --> 06:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:07.670 --> 06:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
so again but but what this what this law
 
06:39:09.830 --> 06:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
if enacted would do would prohibit a
 
06:39:11.990 --> 06:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
city council from putting restrictions
 
06:39:13.430 --> 06:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
on police departments from assisting
 
06:39:15.350 --> 06:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement officers right
 
06:39:16.708 --> 06:39:16.718 align:start position:0%
it would it would it would
 
06:39:18.468 --> 06:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say it would require them but
 
06:39:20.468 --> 06:39:20.478 align:start position:0%
the the law enforcement officers would
 
06:39:22.230 --> 06:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
be free to act
 
06:39:24.708 --> 06:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
um with encourage
 
06:39:26.468 --> 06:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
in concert with
 
06:39:28.310 --> 06:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement agents absent
 
06:39:29.670 --> 06:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
this law a city council could
 
06:39:31.990 --> 06:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
potentially put in
 
06:39:34.468 --> 06:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
a rule that would prohibit them from
 
06:39:36.468 --> 06:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
from doing it
 
06:39:38.548 --> 06:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
so i i think um
 
06:39:41.190 --> 06:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
this this bill which is
 
06:39:43.270 --> 06:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
one sentence long it's it's not entirely
 
06:39:44.708 --> 06:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
clear to me that that's what this bill
 
06:39:47.350 --> 06:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
does i think that a fair reading of this
 
06:39:49.750 --> 06:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill is that any police department
 
06:39:49.760 --> 06:39:50.628 align:start position:0%
bill is that any police department
saying

06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
saying
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're just not going you know we'll
 
06:39:54.868 --> 06:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
honor detainers from
 
06:39:54.878 --> 06:39:55.910 align:start position:0%
honor detainers from
um

06:39:55.910 --> 06:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:58.708 --> 06:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
ice or you know will assist federal
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
partners as a rule when they ask us to
 
06:40:03.830 --> 06:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
go on
 
06:40:06.868 --> 06:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
i guess a raid with them
 
06:40:08.788 --> 06:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
that may be covered but
 
06:40:08.798 --> 06:40:10.230 align:start position:0%
that may be covered but
also

06:40:10.230 --> 06:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:40:11.910 --> 06:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
if a police department were to say we're
 
06:40:13.510 --> 06:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
just not going to
 
06:40:15.190 --> 06:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
ask people who we interact with when
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
they're reporting crimes about their
 
06:40:18.390 --> 06:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
immigration status
 
06:40:20.230 --> 06:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
i think that arguably discourages the
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal immigration laws
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
i think that the law as written is so
 
06:40:26.868 --> 06:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
vague that a police department may not
 
06:40:29.510 --> 06:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
feel that it could enact a policy saying
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to ask victims of sex
 
06:40:33.110 --> 06:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
trafficking their immigration status for
 
06:40:33.120 --> 06:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
trafficking their immigration status for
example

06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:40.868 --> 06:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
representative wrong thank you mr
 
06:40:42.390 --> 06:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
06:40:42.400 --> 06:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:40:43.440 --> 06:40:44.708 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:40:44.708 --> 06:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:46.548 --> 06:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
following some of your comments one of
 
06:40:48.708 --> 06:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
the concerns i have that i want to ask
 
06:40:50.070 --> 06:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
you about is
 
06:40:52.868 --> 06:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes as it's been
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
submitted would it um
 
06:40:58.070 --> 06:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
risk costly litigation on the part of
 
06:41:00.070 --> 06:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:41:02.708 --> 06:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
it could or or probably more likely
 
06:41:05.190 --> 06:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
local communities who are the ones who
 
06:41:07.430 --> 06:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be facing section 1983 lawsuits
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
such as the ones that we brought in the
 
06:41:11.110 --> 06:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
case uh that i mentioned before of the
 
06:41:15.030 --> 06:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
gentleman in exeter who was arrested um
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh after he assisted the police
 
06:41:19.350 --> 06:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
department in its investigation and so
 
06:41:21.430 --> 06:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes i think it could okay thank you for
 
06:41:21.440 --> 06:41:23.350 align:start position:0%
yes i think it could okay thank you for
litigation

06:41:23.350 --> 06:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
06:41:26.868 --> 06:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.708 --> 06:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:33.030 --> 06:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
do you agree that
 
06:41:35.190 --> 06:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
the premise is that we must enforce all
 
06:41:37.430 --> 06:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
laws and so i'm having a confusion
 
06:41:39.830 --> 06:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
between this and forcing federal laws
 
06:41:39.840 --> 06:41:40.548 align:start position:0%
between this and forcing federal laws
and

06:41:40.548 --> 06:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:41:42.868 --> 06:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
just enforcing laws in general i mean i
 
06:41:44.868 --> 06:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be good policy for
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
them to have a bill that said you
 
06:41:48.788 --> 06:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't enforce speeding laws or some
 
06:41:51.030 --> 06:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
other law is there a question coming
 
06:41:52.548 --> 06:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
that's my question do you agree with
 
06:41:52.558 --> 06:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
that's my question do you agree with
that

06:41:53.750 --> 06:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:41:55.510 --> 06:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
would that be good policy
 
06:41:58.150 --> 06:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
because the police you know don't stop
 
06:41:59.590 --> 06:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
everybody that goes over the speed limit
 
06:42:01.590 --> 06:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm having a trouble with this
 
06:42:03.270 --> 06:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'd say is that
 
06:42:05.030 --> 06:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
it would be an impossibility for the
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
police to enforce every law all the time
 
06:42:07.840 --> 06:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
police to enforce every law all the time
and

06:42:09.030 --> 06:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:11.110 --> 06:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
probably not what any member of this
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
community of this committee would expect
 
06:42:15.110 --> 06:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
the police to do in every circumstance
 
06:42:15.120 --> 06:42:16.310 align:start position:0%
the police to do in every circumstance
and

06:42:16.310 --> 06:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:18.548 --> 06:42:18.558 align:start position:0%
this bill if passed would take away that
 
06:42:20.310 --> 06:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
discretion from
 
06:42:20.320 --> 06:42:22.150 align:start position:0%
discretion from
um

06:42:22.150 --> 06:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:23.510 --> 06:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
from the police departments and the
 
06:42:24.788 --> 06:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
local control
 
06:42:27.590 --> 06:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
that we value in new hampshire
 
06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:42:30.230 --> 06:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:42:33.830 --> 06:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question this is
 
06:42:36.548 --> 06:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
an expansive um
 
06:42:39.510 --> 06:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill and i read the
 
06:42:42.230 --> 06:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i have questions coming but
 
06:42:45.590 --> 06:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
when it says that um
 
06:42:47.590 --> 06:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
there shall be no action
 
06:42:50.070 --> 06:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh by you know person employee to
 
06:42:52.390 --> 06:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit limit in any way restrict or
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
discourage the enforcement of federal
 
06:42:55.830 --> 06:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
immigration immigration laws
 
06:42:58.390 --> 06:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
would failing to ask
 
06:43:00.468 --> 06:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
someone's status as you've noted is
 
06:43:02.548 --> 06:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
common policy in many departments would
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
that violate this statute as you read it
 
06:43:07.270 --> 06:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think it might i think that the
 
06:43:11.750 --> 06:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:14.150 --> 06:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit for example the governor from
 
06:43:16.548 --> 06:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
saying if he ever or she ever were to
 
06:43:16.558 --> 06:43:17.590 align:start position:0%
saying if he ever or she ever were to
choose

06:43:17.590 --> 06:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
choose
 
06:43:19.430 --> 06:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
we think that the
 
06:43:22.948 --> 06:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
federal government should prioritize xyz
 
06:43:24.788 --> 06:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
immigration laws i think it's it's
 
06:43:26.468 --> 06:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
beyond just
 
06:43:28.390 --> 06:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
a local police department has to comply
 
06:43:30.868 --> 06:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
with the request from ice to go on a
 
06:43:33.430 --> 06:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
raid it's discouraging the enforcement
 
06:43:34.868 --> 06:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
of federal immigration laws it's pretty
 
06:43:34.878 --> 06:43:37.510 align:start position:0%
of federal immigration laws it's pretty
broad

06:43:37.510 --> 06:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:39.510 --> 06:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
if i may follow up that you recognize
 
06:43:40.948 --> 06:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and you
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
sort of honed in on what i was getting
 
06:43:44.310 --> 06:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
at with the discourage question that's
 
06:43:46.230 --> 06:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
sort of an open-ended word
 
06:43:48.390 --> 06:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh so is that then
 
06:43:50.150 --> 06:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass would that then
 
06:43:52.468 --> 06:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
force our departments to take certain
 
06:43:54.628 --> 06:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
actions so that they did not violate
 
06:43:54.638 --> 06:43:55.510 align:start position:0%
actions so that they did not violate
this

06:43:55.510 --> 06:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:43:55.520 --> 06:43:56.390 align:start position:0%
this
statute

06:43:56.390 --> 06:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:44:01.510 --> 06:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:03.510 --> 06:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
06:44:04.948 --> 06:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:44:08.788 --> 06:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:10.948 --> 06:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
if i understand you're an attorney
 
06:44:12.468 --> 06:44:12.478 align:start position:0%
yes sir yeah thank you
 
06:44:12.478 --> 06:44:13.430 align:start position:0%
yes sir yeah thank you
um

06:44:13.430 --> 06:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:15.910 --> 06:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
in this one sentence
 
06:44:17.350 --> 06:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
four lines
 
06:44:19.670 --> 06:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see where it says
 
06:44:19.680 --> 06:44:20.788 align:start position:0%
i don't see where it says
that

06:44:20.788 --> 06:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:22.788 --> 06:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
if this passed the every police that
 
06:44:25.030 --> 06:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
pulls over somebody
 
06:44:28.150 --> 06:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
has to ask immigration like nazi germany
 
06:44:31.190 --> 06:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and being an attorney i would think
 
06:44:33.110 --> 06:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
you could answer
 
06:44:33.120 --> 06:44:34.150 align:start position:0%
you could answer
more

06:44:34.150 --> 06:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:44:36.070 --> 06:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know yes this is what the law is or
 
06:44:40.150 --> 06:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't not it could or it may
 
06:44:42.310 --> 06:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
you know i would like more of a direct
 
06:44:44.868 --> 06:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
if you could where is it in these four
 
06:44:44.878 --> 06:44:46.230 align:start position:0%
if you could where is it in these four
lines

06:44:46.230 --> 06:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
lines
 
06:44:48.788 --> 06:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
that they have to stop people
 
06:44:51.270 --> 06:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
of any color and say where is your what
 
06:44:52.548 --> 06:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
is your immigration
 
06:44:54.150 --> 06:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
status so
 
06:44:56.070 --> 06:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd start globally by saying
 
06:44:58.548 --> 06:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
that sometimes statutes are not clear
 
06:45:00.708 --> 06:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
and need judicial resolution
 
06:45:03.030 --> 06:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
and not being a judge i can't tell you
 
06:45:04.868 --> 06:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
how necessarily a court would
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
definitively interpret the statute but
 
06:45:09.910 --> 06:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
my reading is if a police department has
 
06:45:11.110 --> 06:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
06:45:14.230 --> 06:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
that says we are not going to ask
 
06:45:16.628 --> 06:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
every single person who we stop their
 
06:45:18.230 --> 06:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
immigration status or if they have a
 
06:45:20.468 --> 06:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
policy that says we are not going to ask
 
06:45:22.390 --> 06:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
victims of sex crimes their immigration
 
06:45:22.400 --> 06:45:23.670 align:start position:0%
victims of sex crimes their immigration
status

06:45:23.670 --> 06:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
status
 
06:45:25.510 --> 06:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that discourages the enforcement of
 
06:45:26.948 --> 06:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
immigration laws i think that's a fair
 
06:45:26.958 --> 06:45:27.910 align:start position:0%
immigration laws i think that's a fair
reading

06:45:27.910 --> 06:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
reading
 
06:45:29.830 --> 06:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the statute
 
06:45:31.510 --> 06:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
or restricts the enforcement of
 
06:45:34.708 --> 06:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
immigration laws i think i mean i guess
 
06:45:36.310 --> 06:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
my my answer is that restrict and
 
06:45:38.788 --> 06:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
discourage are undefined in the statute
 
06:45:39.750 --> 06:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:45:41.910 --> 06:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative roy thank you mr chairman
 
06:45:45.990 --> 06:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:47.830 --> 06:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
i actually agree with some of this
 
06:45:47.840 --> 06:45:49.830 align:start position:0%
i actually agree with some of this
vagueness

06:45:49.830 --> 06:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
vagueness
 
06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
would what would the aclu's position be
 
06:45:52.320 --> 06:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
would what would the aclu's position be
on

06:45:53.270 --> 06:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
this law if it just said
 
06:45:57.990 --> 06:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:46:00.868 --> 06:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
is prohibited from ignoring detainers on
 
06:46:06.070 --> 06:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
someone who's taken into custody on a on
 
06:46:07.750 --> 06:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
another crime
 
06:46:09.190 --> 06:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
in other words not detainers that are
 
06:46:11.350 --> 06:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
discovered like your client in a store
 
06:46:13.270 --> 06:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
or anywhere else only if the person were
 
06:46:15.830 --> 06:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
arrested on a local state crime by a
 
06:46:17.990 --> 06:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement and they saw a
 
06:46:19.990 --> 06:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
detainer in the system
 
06:46:22.070 --> 06:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
they're prohibited from ignoring that
 
06:46:23.750 --> 06:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
what would the position the aclu be on
 
06:46:26.390 --> 06:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
that sure so if i could just start by
 
06:46:28.070 --> 06:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately caveating what i'm about
 
06:46:30.150 --> 06:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
to say which is that i can't give you an
 
06:46:32.150 --> 06:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
official position as to the aclu of new
 
06:46:33.350 --> 06:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire without talking to all my
 
06:46:34.390 --> 06:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues but i can tell you what i
 
06:46:36.788 --> 06:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
think it it may be or sort of give some
 
06:46:38.390 --> 06:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
rougher progress i won't hold you to it
 
06:46:41.030 --> 06:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um and we'd be happy
 
06:46:42.948 --> 06:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
i should say we'd be happy to
 
06:46:44.708 --> 06:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know speak with you directly or work
 
06:46:46.070 --> 06:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
on any particular language if that's
 
06:46:47.910 --> 06:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
something you're interested in
 
06:46:51.110 --> 06:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
one concern that we would have with
 
06:46:53.350 --> 06:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
what you just suggested is if the
 
06:46:55.270 --> 06:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
person's in custody but would otherwise
 
06:46:58.150 --> 06:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
be released is their detention prolonged
 
06:47:00.230 --> 06:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of
 
06:47:02.628 --> 06:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
um the immigration detainer so for
 
06:47:02.638 --> 06:47:03.750 align:start position:0%
um the immigration detainer so for
example

06:47:03.750 --> 06:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
example
 
06:47:06.548 --> 06:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
um if a person is being released from
 
06:47:08.070 --> 06:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise being released from valley
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
street jail
 
06:47:11.510 --> 06:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that a thing pops up and it says
 
06:47:13.590 --> 06:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
that there's an immigration detainer
 
06:47:15.830 --> 06:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
and they call ice and ice comes over ice
 
06:47:17.910 --> 06:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
is in manchester so it may be quick and
 
06:47:19.270 --> 06:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
it may not
 
06:47:20.868 --> 06:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
prolong their detention
 
06:47:22.948 --> 06:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
but the same thing were to happen
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
um when a person is being released from
 
06:47:26.948 --> 06:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
the jail in north haverhill new
 
06:47:29.030 --> 06:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and grafton county it may take
 
06:47:30.708 --> 06:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
ice several hours to get there and so it
 
06:47:32.948 --> 06:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
may be that the jail is otherwise
 
06:47:35.350 --> 06:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
extending their detention by a matter of
 
06:47:37.990 --> 06:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
hours in order to comply with the ice
 
06:47:39.510 --> 06:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
detainer and so i think we would have
 
06:47:42.230 --> 06:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
concerns with that because it would be
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
a detention not otherwise authorized by
 
06:47:47.350 --> 06:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
state law and not based on
 
06:47:48.868 --> 06:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
any sort of neutral and detached
 
06:47:51.510 --> 06:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates finding a probable cause i i
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
hope that was clear enough
 
06:47:57.510 --> 06:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
if it was if the chair would commit just
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
make a follow-up
 
06:47:58.798 --> 06:48:00.390 align:start position:0%
make a follow-up
so

06:48:00.390 --> 06:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:48:02.708 --> 06:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
i i understand so
 
06:48:05.190 --> 06:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
under that theory though if anyone is
 
06:48:08.310 --> 06:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
inconvenienced by the detainer
 
06:48:10.468 --> 06:48:10.478 align:start position:0%
what good are these detainers if nobody
 
06:48:12.548 --> 06:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
can act on them
 
06:48:12.558 --> 06:48:13.270 align:start position:0%
can act on them
well

06:48:13.270 --> 06:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:48:15.030 --> 06:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
i guess i would reject the premise of
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
your question that being detained in
 
06:48:18.948 --> 06:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
jail is an inconvenience i think it's a
 
06:48:20.548 --> 06:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
greater intrusion into someone's civil
 
06:48:21.990 --> 06:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
liberties well if you were getting out
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
anyway and you had to stay an extra hour
 
06:48:29.350 --> 06:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:32.390 --> 06:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
we agree you're an attorney but
 
06:48:32.400 --> 06:48:33.910 align:start position:0%
we agree you're an attorney but
regardless

06:48:33.910 --> 06:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
06:48:36.070 --> 06:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
i will say that i if if you have
 
06:48:37.510 --> 06:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
language that you want us to take a look
 
06:48:39.270 --> 06:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
at we we are always happy to do that
 
06:48:44.628 --> 06:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:46.070 --> 06:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh
 
06:48:48.230 --> 06:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh testifying of the chairman choir with
 
06:48:49.270 --> 06:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:48:52.230 --> 06:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:48:53.670 --> 06:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
i understood your testimony that it's
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
good policy for to allow police officers
 
06:48:57.350 --> 06:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
to exercise
 
06:49:00.708 --> 06:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
judgment and make judgment calls
 
06:49:02.788 --> 06:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
what is there any thought on the on the
 
06:49:04.708 --> 06:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
idea though that if you had the other
 
06:49:07.030 --> 06:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
reverse policy where it was the standard
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
to not enforce any immigration laws at
 
06:49:12.310 --> 06:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
all such as in dover would that
 
06:49:14.390 --> 06:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
was your opinion opinion on a policy
 
06:49:16.628 --> 06:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:49:19.030 --> 06:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i'm in a position to
 
06:49:20.788 --> 06:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
announce an opinion on dover's police
 
06:49:24.150 --> 06:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:25.750 --> 06:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
if you haven't reviewed it that's a fair
 
06:49:28.948 --> 06:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:30.788 --> 06:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
representative connolly thank you mr
 
06:49:32.628 --> 06:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
06:49:33.830 --> 06:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have law enforcement in the
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
room that i see so i'm not sure who best
 
06:49:39.110 --> 06:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
to direct this question but i have heard
 
06:49:39.120 --> 06:49:40.548 align:start position:0%
to direct this question but i have heard
conflicting

06:49:40.548 --> 06:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
conflicting
 
06:49:40.558 --> 06:49:41.750 align:start position:0%
conflicting
uh

06:49:41.750 --> 06:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:49:44.708 --> 06:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
testimony about what actually happens if
 
06:49:47.030 --> 06:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
somebody with a detainer
 
06:49:47.040 --> 06:49:47.830 align:start position:0%
somebody with a detainer
is

06:49:47.830 --> 06:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:49:50.548 --> 06:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
has an interaction with law enforcement
 
06:49:52.390 --> 06:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
what would happen in this state i've
 
06:49:53.670 --> 06:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
heard different things from different
 
06:49:55.190 --> 06:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses and i'd love
 
06:49:56.948 --> 06:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
an answer if you can provide that and i
 
06:49:58.708 --> 06:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
just i don't see law enforcement to
 
06:50:01.110 --> 06:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
direct that to i think it depends on the
 
06:50:02.468 --> 06:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
department that
 
06:50:04.230 --> 06:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
arrests them
 
06:50:06.628 --> 06:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
some departments may check some may not
 
06:50:08.868 --> 06:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
some may honor those some may not i i
 
06:50:10.468 --> 06:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
think it probably is a case-by-case
 
06:50:14.948 --> 06:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:20.230 --> 06:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:50:22.468 --> 06:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:50:23.910 --> 06:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:50:25.910 --> 06:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
the police now have some discretion or
 
06:50:29.110 --> 06:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
some limited discretion to
 
06:50:31.590 --> 06:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
do what you just testified to
 
06:50:34.150 --> 06:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
do you think that this bill would limit
 
06:50:36.310 --> 06:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of discretion
 
06:50:36.320 --> 06:50:38.708 align:start position:0%
that kind of discretion
yes

06:50:38.708 --> 06:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:45.750 --> 06:50:45.760 align:start position:0%

06:50:49.750 --> 06:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
the witness is excused

06:50:58.478 --> 06:51:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
finally

06:51:08.070 --> 06:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:11.670 --> 06:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
so uh hello committee um
 
06:51:13.510 --> 06:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative abbas and committee my
 
06:51:15.270 --> 06:51:15.280 align:start position:0%

and i am with rights and democracy new
hampshire

06:51:18.548 --> 06:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:51:21.030 --> 06:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i am also speaking as an immigrant
 
06:51:23.830 --> 06:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
who understands many of the fears that
 
06:51:25.910 --> 06:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
immigrants live with
 
06:51:28.150 --> 06:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
as they are misunderstood minorities
 
06:51:30.468 --> 06:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
often times in this country
 
06:51:32.390 --> 06:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
including understanding that often times
 
06:51:33.868 --> 06:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
because of stereotypes or
 
06:51:36.230 --> 06:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
mischaracterizations of us we are seen
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
as a threat
 
06:51:39.750 --> 06:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
as a muslim woman whose community often
 
06:51:42.150 --> 06:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
gets labeled as violence i still face
 
06:51:44.788 --> 06:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
interactions assumptions that i could be
 
06:51:46.948 --> 06:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
violent and profiled because of my
 
06:51:46.958 --> 06:51:48.468 align:start position:0%
violent and profiled because of my
identity

06:51:48.468 --> 06:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
identity
 
06:51:50.708 --> 06:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
when i was a child i remember a woman
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
trying to reach out to my parents
 
06:51:55.830 --> 06:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
basically was the landlord and she told
 
06:51:57.830 --> 06:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
me that she would call police and tell
 
06:52:00.628 --> 06:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
them that i was illegal and that we were
 
06:52:00.638 --> 06:52:01.910 align:start position:0%
them that i was illegal and that we were
illegal

06:52:01.910 --> 06:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
06:52:03.910 --> 06:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
i was so confused
 
06:52:06.628 --> 06:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
i did not understand what she meant
 
06:52:08.548 --> 06:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
the strategy she employed of calling
 
06:52:11.030 --> 06:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
police was intended to threaten us of
 
06:52:11.040 --> 06:52:12.708 align:start position:0%
police was intended to threaten us of
deportation

06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
deportation
 
06:52:15.030 --> 06:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
this very thing happens to many people
 
06:52:17.510 --> 06:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
including victims of domestic violence
 
06:52:19.350 --> 06:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they stay in abusive
 
06:52:21.590 --> 06:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
situations because of fear that police
 
06:52:24.150 --> 06:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
involvement could mean deportation so
 
06:52:27.750 --> 06:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually this does affect people who
 
06:52:29.670 --> 06:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
are in situations with domestic violence
 
06:52:32.310 --> 06:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
i know there are laws to protect people
 
06:52:34.628 --> 06:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
who are in domestic violence
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
cases to keep them in the country but
 
06:52:39.190 --> 06:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
as someone who is an advocate for
 
06:52:40.628 --> 06:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
domestic violence i am actually
 
06:52:42.310 --> 06:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
certified in the state of new hampshire
 
06:52:43.910 --> 06:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
and vermont
 
06:52:46.150 --> 06:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that that process
 
06:52:48.468 --> 06:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
includes getting a letter from the
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
police department or a judge so not all
 
06:52:53.750 --> 06:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
women get that and so again not all
 
06:52:56.310 --> 06:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
women go to the police department
 
06:52:57.910 --> 06:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they won't give it to
 
06:52:59.110 --> 06:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
them right
 
06:53:01.030 --> 06:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
i did eventually become a citizen at the
 
06:53:03.510 --> 06:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
age of 16 i need people to know that for
 
06:53:06.070 --> 06:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
many immigrants there is not
 
06:53:08.548 --> 06:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
a pathway to citizenship for them
 
06:53:11.190 --> 06:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i do want to go back and just make
 
06:53:12.310 --> 06:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
06:53:14.310 --> 06:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
to be clear that a human being cannot be
 
06:53:16.390 --> 06:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
illegal and so often times when we talk
 
06:53:18.310 --> 06:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
about people that do not have
 
06:53:19.750 --> 06:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
documentation we'll just call them
 
06:53:21.430 --> 06:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
undocumented for those
 
06:53:22.868 --> 06:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
who want to do the right thing and just
 
06:53:24.628 --> 06:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
don't know what language to use we can
 
06:53:26.868 --> 06:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
just say undocumented
 
06:53:29.430 --> 06:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
because when we call people illegal we
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
are basically saying their humanity is
 
06:53:33.430 --> 06:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
criminalized right so we're just saying
 
06:53:35.590 --> 06:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
that their humanity is criminalized for
 
06:53:37.190 --> 06:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
being human and that's just crazy
 
06:53:39.670 --> 06:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
instead of the act of doing something
 
06:53:41.910 --> 06:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
that is not legal
 
06:53:43.350 --> 06:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
so there are several important points i
 
06:53:44.628 --> 06:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
want to make today
 
06:53:46.948 --> 06:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
one most undocumented immigrants have
 
06:53:48.468 --> 06:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
actually come to the united states
 
06:53:48.478 --> 06:53:49.590 align:start position:0%
actually come to the united states
legally

06:53:49.590 --> 06:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
legally
 
06:53:51.830 --> 06:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
and found themselves undocumented
 
06:53:53.670 --> 06:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
because of not being able to renew
 
06:53:56.070 --> 06:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
documents because of language barriers
 
06:53:57.750 --> 06:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:54:01.670 --> 06:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
also there are about 10 to 15 000
 
06:54:03.430 --> 06:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants in the state of
 
06:54:04.628 --> 06:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
06:54:06.708 --> 06:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants boost our
 
06:54:06.718 --> 06:54:08.150 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants boost our
economy

06:54:08.150 --> 06:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
economy
 
06:54:10.230 --> 06:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants have contributed
 
06:54:10.240 --> 06:54:12.070 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants have contributed
14.3

06:54:12.070 --> 06:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
14.3
 
06:54:14.708 --> 06:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal taxes and
 
06:54:17.910 --> 06:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
guess what 6.1 million dollars in state
 
06:54:19.910 --> 06:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
and local taxes and that is research
 
06:54:21.830 --> 06:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
done by new american economy that i can
 
06:54:23.110 --> 06:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
send to you
 
06:54:25.030 --> 06:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
we could not continue to use immigrants
 
06:54:27.510 --> 06:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
for their labor their contributions we
 
06:54:29.510 --> 06:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
benefit off their backs but yet we
 
06:54:32.468 --> 06:54:32.478 align:start position:0%
devalue their humanity it is time for us
 
06:54:34.548 --> 06:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate our appreciation of the
 
06:54:37.190 --> 06:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
labor and the sacrifices of immigrants
 
06:54:39.590 --> 06:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
many of whom are essential workers and
 
06:54:42.230 --> 06:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
have carried us through this pandemic
 
06:54:43.670 --> 06:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to share a story that an
 
06:54:45.430 --> 06:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrant has shared with
 
06:54:45.440 --> 06:54:46.230 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrant has shared with
me

06:54:46.230 --> 06:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:54:48.708 --> 06:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
she came to the united states as a child
 
06:54:50.230 --> 06:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
she did not know that she was
 
06:54:53.030 --> 06:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
undocumented and she got older as is the
 
06:54:55.270 --> 06:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
experience of many undocumented people
 
06:54:57.030 --> 06:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the united states
 
06:54:58.788 --> 06:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
she told me a little bit about her
 
06:54:58.798 --> 06:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
she told me a little bit about her
struggles

06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
struggles
 
06:55:02.468 --> 06:55:02.478 align:start position:0%
she said when she goes into a car she
 
06:55:04.230 --> 06:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
has to make sure everything is right if
 
06:55:06.070 --> 06:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's dark outside she has to check her
 
06:55:08.948 --> 06:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
front lights her rear lights because she
 
06:55:11.590 --> 06:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
never knows if a police officer stops
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
her she is afraid that he will think
 
06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's law
 
06:55:18.548 --> 06:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
to call immigration enforcement and have
 
06:55:20.788 --> 06:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
her deported because
 
06:55:22.070 --> 06:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know they're taught they have to
 
06:55:25.110 --> 06:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
follow the law and unfortunately like
 
06:55:26.628 --> 06:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
some other people mentioned we're
 
06:55:28.868 --> 06:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
talking about criminal law is the
 
06:55:31.110 --> 06:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
federal policy and then we have civil
 
06:55:31.120 --> 06:55:31.910 align:start position:0%
federal policy and then we have civil
law

06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:55:34.628 --> 06:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
to be here undocumented is not a
 
06:55:37.510 --> 06:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
criminal offense it is a civil offense
 
06:55:39.110 --> 06:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're talking about so
 
06:55:41.190 --> 06:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about also
 
06:55:43.190 --> 06:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
detainers and this confusion about
 
06:55:45.030 --> 06:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
detainers we have to understand that
 
06:55:48.150 --> 06:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
detainers is not a legal warrant that
 
06:55:50.390 --> 06:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
means there are some detainers that have
 
06:55:52.390 --> 06:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
to do with a criminal offense somebody
 
06:55:55.350 --> 06:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
committed a crime right and we should we
 
06:55:57.110 --> 06:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
have to by law make sure we share that
 
06:55:59.030 --> 06:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
information but when we're talking about
 
06:56:01.510 --> 06:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
detainers for a civil offense that means
 
06:56:04.628 --> 06:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
someone is just considered a criminal or
 
06:56:06.948 --> 06:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
we just want to punish them simply
 
06:56:08.788 --> 06:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
because they are undocumented and i
 
06:56:11.110 --> 06:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
shared a story how some people no fault
 
06:56:12.948 --> 06:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
of their own how they wound up in this
 
06:56:14.708 --> 06:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
country that is ridiculous and that is
 
06:56:16.548 --> 06:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
what we are addressing here
 
06:56:16.558 --> 06:56:17.750 align:start position:0%
what we are addressing here
today

06:56:17.750 --> 06:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:56:19.990 --> 06:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
we are not saying going against federal
 
06:56:22.788 --> 06:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
criminal law but what we are saying is
 
06:56:24.548 --> 06:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
it is a civil offense not a criminal
 
06:56:27.110 --> 06:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
offense to be here undocumented
 
06:56:29.590 --> 06:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:56:32.628 --> 06:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
her story is just one of many i used to
 
06:56:34.310 --> 06:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
live in the city of lebanon new
 
06:56:36.390 --> 06:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we passed an ordinance to
 
06:56:38.468 --> 06:56:38.478 align:start position:0%
ensure that police do not share
 
06:56:41.190 --> 06:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
information with immigration customs
 
06:56:43.510 --> 06:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and again not all
 
06:56:44.628 --> 06:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
information i'm talking about
 
06:56:46.628 --> 06:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
information that has to do with a civil
 
06:56:48.708 --> 06:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
offence just being here so that means if
 
06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
a police officer stops someone and again
 
06:56:53.430 --> 06:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
we talked about me being racially
 
06:56:55.110 --> 06:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
profiled and other people brown and
 
06:56:57.430 --> 06:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
black people and when police officers
 
06:56:58.868 --> 06:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
stop them and they do not have
 
06:57:01.430 --> 06:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
documentation they might call
 
06:57:03.430 --> 06:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
immigration customs enforcement and this
 
06:57:05.350 --> 06:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
is saying do not and this has helped our
 
06:57:07.030 --> 06:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
community in lebanon it's helped
 
06:57:09.670 --> 06:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
immigrants feel safer and so that is why
 
06:57:13.350 --> 06:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
we are strongly opposed to this crazy
 
06:57:13.360 --> 06:57:26.548 align:start position:0%
we are strongly opposed to this crazy
bill

06:57:26.548 --> 06:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:28.868 --> 06:57:28.878 align:start position:0%

06:57:42.948 --> 06:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
listen representative first of all the
 
06:57:44.468 --> 06:57:44.478 align:start position:0%
members on the committee
 
06:57:45.750 --> 06:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
only please only speak if you were
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak
 
06:57:48.240 --> 06:57:49.030 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak
you

06:57:49.030 --> 06:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:57:50.628 --> 06:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's one number two we're not in an
 
06:57:51.990 --> 06:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
06:57:53.990 --> 06:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe the member knows
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
knows that we're in a public hearing
 
06:57:57.510 --> 06:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's members of the public
 
06:57:58.708 --> 06:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
who are sitting in the audience that
 
06:58:01.030 --> 06:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity to testify
 
06:58:01.040 --> 06:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity to testify
yet

06:58:01.990 --> 06:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:58:03.590 --> 06:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
and they've been waiting patiently i
 
06:58:05.750 --> 06:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe we at least owe them those
 
06:58:07.670 --> 06:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
members of the public the respect to let
 
06:58:07.680 --> 06:58:08.548 align:start position:0%
members of the public the respect to let
them

06:58:08.548 --> 06:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:58:09.990 --> 06:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
speak whether in support or in
 
06:58:11.510 --> 06:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
06:58:13.910 --> 06:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to rule that out of order
 
06:58:15.510 --> 06:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
and if even if we were in the executive
 
06:58:16.868 --> 06:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
session you would still
 
06:58:19.190 --> 06:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
need to be recognized to make that which
 
06:58:20.788 --> 06:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
we're not so
 
06:58:23.110 --> 06:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's right and i apologize to
 
06:58:27.670 --> 06:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:31.110 --> 06:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:35.750 --> 06:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh parliamentary inquiry
 
06:58:37.270 --> 06:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
you i was gonna ask that the witness
 
06:58:39.910 --> 06:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
wish to continue her testimony
 
06:58:41.270 --> 06:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
i don't remember maybe i'll just say
 
06:58:43.910 --> 06:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um representative i will
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
just say like any one of you every
 
06:58:47.910 --> 06:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
single one of you i should say every
 
06:58:49.350 --> 06:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
single one of you
 
06:58:53.030 --> 06:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
if you felt unsafe
 
06:58:56.548 --> 06:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you take your family and leave
 
06:58:58.628 --> 06:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
and i want us to think about that people
 
06:59:00.150 --> 06:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
are in this country
 
06:59:01.590 --> 06:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
not because they're trying to take
 
06:59:03.510 --> 06:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
resources away and i talked about they
 
06:59:04.868 --> 06:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
contribute here
 
06:59:07.510 --> 06:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're fleeing violence
 
06:59:09.510 --> 06:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes it's something that we've
 
06:59:11.750 --> 06:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
done in other countries that has caused
 
06:59:14.310 --> 06:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
people to flee where they are and to
 
06:59:17.670 --> 06:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
seek safety so let's offer that humanity
 
06:59:20.070 --> 06:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
that we should offer every single person
 
06:59:21.670 --> 06:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
and welcome people
 
06:59:23.350 --> 06:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
they are contributing members of our
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
society and until we fix our immigration
 
06:59:27.750 --> 06:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
system and ensure a pathway to
 
06:59:33.430 --> 06:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:36.868 --> 06:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:59:38.628 --> 06:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
you representative are you ever you want
 
06:59:40.628 --> 06:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
to be recognized for a question
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
i do thank you will you take the
 
06:59:42.000 --> 06:59:42.868 align:start position:0%
i do thank you will you take the
question

06:59:42.868 --> 06:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:59:44.868 --> 06:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
yes who are you i'm way over here behind
 
06:59:46.788 --> 06:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
06:59:48.390 --> 06:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
you you um
 
06:59:50.708 --> 06:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
you made a statement that
 
06:59:54.230 --> 06:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
um being um undocumented is a civil
 
06:59:54.240 --> 06:59:55.510 align:start position:0%
um being um undocumented is a civil
infraction

06:59:55.510 --> 06:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
infraction
 
06:59:57.990 --> 06:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
is it always a simple infraction no it
 
06:59:59.750 --> 06:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
is not always a civil infraction and
 
07:00:01.990 --> 07:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for is the fact that
 
07:00:04.788 --> 07:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
when it is a civil fraction leave people
 
07:00:04.798 --> 07:00:06.150 align:start position:0%
when it is a civil fraction leave people
alone

07:00:06.150 --> 07:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
alone
 
07:00:08.070 --> 07:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're asking for immigrants
 
07:00:09.990 --> 07:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
should be treated like every single
 
07:00:19.110 --> 07:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:22.868 --> 07:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:24.628 --> 07:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
did you have a question for the witness
 
07:00:26.788 --> 07:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chair i still have that
 
07:00:27.990 --> 07:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
question for you but i don't want to
 
07:00:29.350 --> 07:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
step on
 
07:00:31.190 --> 07:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
what is happening with our witness
 
07:00:33.830 --> 07:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
especially since she's a constituent
 
07:00:37.270 --> 07:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:39.030 --> 07:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
i said if you don't have a question for
 
07:00:40.868 --> 07:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
the witness the witness is excused you
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
may be recognized for a parliamentary
 
07:00:44.628 --> 07:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you mr chair and again i
 
07:00:46.948 --> 07:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
apologize to the witness
 
07:00:49.110 --> 07:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
for stepping on her testimony because
 
07:00:51.110 --> 07:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
that is a faux pas she's my constituent
 
07:00:53.030 --> 07:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
anyway um
 
07:00:54.548 --> 07:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
i saved you
 
07:00:56.788 --> 07:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that i really do
 
07:00:58.788 --> 07:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
genuine question because i don't know
 
07:01:00.548 --> 07:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
the answer nothing
 
07:01:04.548 --> 07:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:08.468 --> 07:01:08.478 align:start position:0%
who calls executive sessions and how
 
07:01:11.270 --> 07:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
is it only ever the chair or can anyone
 
07:01:14.310 --> 07:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:16.468 --> 07:01:16.478 align:start position:0%
and if we don't know the answer for sure
 
07:01:19.430 --> 07:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
can we check we can speak we can i know
 
07:01:21.430 --> 07:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated answer it could be
 
07:01:22.788 --> 07:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
noticed it's noticed today that an
 
07:01:24.230 --> 07:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
executive session may follow but we're
 
07:01:25.910 --> 07:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
still in the public hearing so we
 
07:01:27.990 --> 07:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't end the public hearing early to
 
07:01:30.310 --> 07:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
vote or make a recommendation to an
 
07:01:32.150 --> 07:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
executive session to the public hearing
 
07:01:33.270 --> 07:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
is concluded
 
07:01:36.628 --> 07:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
okay but my question really is
 
07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh whom among us i hope that's
 
07:01:43.030 --> 07:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
can call executive session
 
07:01:44.310 --> 07:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee would have to
 
07:01:46.468 --> 07:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
open the executive session no one else
 
07:01:51.110 --> 07:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:53.750 --> 07:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
then then it would go to the vice chair
 
07:01:55.030 --> 07:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee and then if the vice
 
07:01:56.390 --> 07:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
chair and chair were not here would then
 
07:01:58.548 --> 07:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
go to the ranking member of the majority
 
07:02:03.190 --> 07:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:03.200 --> 07:02:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

07:07:29.830 --> 07:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
i didn't have um
 
07:07:31.590 --> 07:07:31.600 align:start position:0%

country i am legally here speaking today
 
07:07:40.400 --> 07:07:41.190 align:start position:0%
country i am legally here speaking today
so

07:07:41.190 --> 07:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:07:44.548 --> 07:07:44.558 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to say is about a little
 
07:07:47.270 --> 07:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
bit i know you're all tired i am tired
 
07:07:49.750 --> 07:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
too but it's a big responsibility to sit
 
07:07:52.230 --> 07:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
on a chair that you're sitting and i am
 
07:07:54.868 --> 07:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
here representing a lot of people i'm
 
07:07:56.708 --> 07:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
representing the individuals that i
 
07:07:59.510 --> 07:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
serve from gateway's community services
 
07:08:00.948 --> 07:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
individuals with a developmental
 
07:08:04.390 --> 07:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
disability in my own brazilian community
 
07:08:07.030 --> 07:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
07:08:09.430 --> 07:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to say that there are
 
07:08:12.788 --> 07:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
so many other more important laws that
 
07:08:14.070 --> 07:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
you should be
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
considering and worry about it
 
07:08:20.390 --> 07:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
then this law that is just confusing to
 
07:08:22.468 --> 07:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
me and i already say that i'm opposed to
 
07:08:22.478 --> 07:08:23.350 align:start position:0%
me and i already say that i'm opposed to
that

07:08:23.350 --> 07:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:08:23.360 --> 07:08:25.430 align:start position:0%
that
laws

07:08:25.430 --> 07:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
laws
 
07:08:26.468 --> 07:08:26.478 align:start position:0%
well i'm gonna talk about
 
07:08:29.670 --> 07:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
microaggression first which is like um
 
07:08:32.070 --> 07:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
today i watch a video and it explains a
 
07:08:34.868 --> 07:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
lot so you can just um
 
07:08:37.430 --> 07:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
it will be i'll be brief the mosquito
 
07:08:37.440 --> 07:08:38.708 align:start position:0%
it will be i'll be brief the mosquito
bite

07:08:38.708 --> 07:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
bite
 
07:08:41.430 --> 07:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
every time people say where you're from
 
07:08:41.440 --> 07:08:42.310 align:start position:0%
every time people say where you're from
um

07:08:42.310 --> 07:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:44.868 --> 07:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
where is your accent from uh do you have
 
07:08:47.110 --> 07:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
documents do you have drive-ins license
 
07:08:50.150 --> 07:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever it's like a little mosquito
 
07:08:52.948 --> 07:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
that bites you when i start working here
 
07:08:55.830 --> 07:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
legally at a pizza place
 
07:08:58.948 --> 07:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
the lady the waitress would scream at me
 
07:09:00.628 --> 07:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
and my boss would say
 
07:09:03.030 --> 07:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
she's not there she can't hear she just
 
07:09:04.708 --> 07:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak english
 
07:09:06.948 --> 07:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
so microaggression is like that little
 
07:09:09.430 --> 07:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
mosquito bite that you get every day
 
07:09:13.030 --> 07:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people here are in this um
 
07:09:14.628 --> 07:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
you know this position getting this
 
07:09:16.788 --> 07:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
mosquito bite getting this micro
 
07:09:19.510 --> 07:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
aggression like every day
 
07:09:23.190 --> 07:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
um so my point is
 
07:09:26.390 --> 07:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
people call me now thick skin because i
 
07:09:28.070 --> 07:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
really don't care anymore if my english
 
07:09:29.510 --> 07:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
is good enough
 
07:09:32.628 --> 07:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
i just care about you know
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
i do have driving slice but do i do care
 
07:09:37.510 --> 07:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
about people that don't so that's why
 
07:09:39.990 --> 07:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm here because i care about the people
 
07:09:41.190 --> 07:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
that are
 
07:09:44.230 --> 07:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
um not document or there are diverse
 
07:09:45.350 --> 07:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are
 
07:09:47.190 --> 07:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
whatever background
 
07:09:51.030 --> 07:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
um to to be here for them so
 
07:09:53.270 --> 07:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
i just think it's a big responsibility
 
07:09:55.910 --> 07:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
to sit on the chair that you're sitting
 
07:09:57.510 --> 07:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that you really should be worrying
 
07:10:00.948 --> 07:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:03.990 --> 07:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
encourage equity inclusion and diversity
 
07:10:06.150 --> 07:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
that will include
 
07:10:08.150 --> 07:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that will encourage that will
 
07:10:10.548 --> 07:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
provide individuals with developmental
 
07:10:13.430 --> 07:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities that i serve every day
 
07:10:16.390 --> 07:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
with inclusion of hearing
 
07:10:18.390 --> 07:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
vision and dental care
 
07:10:21.190 --> 07:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm really concerned about
 
07:10:22.230 --> 07:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
as well
 
07:10:24.468 --> 07:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
and also the driver's license you know
 
07:10:26.628 --> 07:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
every single person every individual
 
07:10:29.110 --> 07:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
should be able to drive
 
07:10:30.868 --> 07:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
if they pass on the right
 
07:10:32.948 --> 07:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
right a written test
 
07:10:34.868 --> 07:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
if they pay their fee if they know how
 
07:10:36.628 --> 07:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
to drive the practical
 
07:10:38.708 --> 07:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
test they should be able to drive so
 
07:10:39.990 --> 07:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
07:10:44.830 --> 07:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
bigger issues enemy immigration is very
 
07:10:44.840 --> 07:10:46.390 align:start position:0%
bigger issues enemy immigration is very
um

07:10:46.390 --> 07:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:48.788 --> 07:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing it's a federal law
 
07:10:50.788 --> 07:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
there's not you know a lot of smart
 
07:10:50.798 --> 07:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
there's not you know a lot of smart
lawyers

07:10:51.910 --> 07:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
07:10:54.548 --> 07:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
get through the you know the laws and do
 
07:10:56.390 --> 07:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
this and do that people
 
07:10:58.070 --> 07:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
can change their status i don't
 
07:10:59.910 --> 07:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
understand that my friends here are
 
07:11:02.468 --> 07:11:02.478 align:start position:0%
lawyers they know better but it's so
 
07:11:05.750 --> 07:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
complex and it's so confusing and it's
 
07:11:08.708 --> 07:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
so not right if you can't have a green
 
07:11:11.510 --> 07:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
card why can you have a great card and
 
07:11:13.910 --> 07:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
be able to drive be able to work be able
 
07:11:15.110 --> 07:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
07:11:15.120 --> 07:11:16.708 align:start position:0%
to leave
so

07:11:16.708 --> 07:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:11:19.430 --> 07:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're tired i'm tired so i apologize if
 
07:11:22.468 --> 07:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
i couldn't express myself well enough
 
07:11:24.628 --> 07:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
but i'm opposed to this field thank you

and if you have any question i'll be
 
07:11:30.548 --> 07:11:30.558 align:start position:0%

who believe that our immigration laws
 
07:12:32.708 --> 07:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
must be reformed to serve our nation's
 
07:12:35.670 --> 07:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
interests we were founded in 1979 we
 
07:12:37.750 --> 07:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
have three million members and

hampshire
 
07:12:44.708 --> 07:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
and before i get started into my
 
07:12:46.628 --> 07:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
testimony i want to say
 
07:12:49.270 --> 07:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
we are a nation of laws we support that
 
07:12:50.830 --> 07:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
and i also want to say that our
 
07:12:52.548 --> 07:12:52.558 align:start position:0%
organization supports illegal
 
07:12:52.558 --> 07:12:54.070 align:start position:0%
organization supports illegal
immigration

07:12:54.070 --> 07:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
07:12:56.628 --> 07:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
we are the most generous nation
 
07:12:58.310 --> 07:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
for those who want to come to the united
 
07:13:00.708 --> 07:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
states in fact right now i'm not sure if
 
07:13:03.510 --> 07:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
we all know this we accept over 1
 
07:13:05.990 --> 07:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
million 1 million
 
07:13:07.750 --> 07:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
immigrants annually
 
07:13:07.760 --> 07:13:08.628 align:start position:0%
immigrants annually
so

07:13:08.628 --> 07:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:13:10.150 --> 07:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
we definitely believe
 
07:13:10.160 --> 07:13:11.190 align:start position:0%
we definitely believe
that

07:13:11.190 --> 07:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:13:13.110 --> 07:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
there should be a legal way into the
 
07:13:16.230 --> 07:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
united states we do believe that
 
07:13:19.030 --> 07:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are finite resources and and
 
07:13:21.030 --> 07:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
we need to as a country determine the
 
07:13:23.190 --> 07:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
07:13:27.190 --> 07:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
now to talk about uh hb 1266 it will
 
07:13:29.430 --> 07:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit jurisdictions from employing
 
07:13:31.350 --> 07:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
dangerous policies that provide a safe
 
07:13:31.360 --> 07:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
dangerous policies that provide a safe
haven

07:13:32.310 --> 07:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
haven
 
07:13:35.030 --> 07:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
or sanctuary in which illegal aliens can
 
07:13:36.390 --> 07:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
live or work without fear of
 
07:13:38.310 --> 07:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
apprehension from federal immigration
 
07:13:38.320 --> 07:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
apprehension from federal immigration
authorities

07:13:39.430 --> 07:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
07:13:41.590 --> 07:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
this is not about enforcing our laws
 
07:13:43.990 --> 07:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's about prohibiting policies that
 
07:13:47.190 --> 07:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
actually will not allow for the federal
 
07:13:48.468 --> 07:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
07:13:52.070 --> 07:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:54.390 --> 07:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policies come in all shapes
 
07:13:55.670 --> 07:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
and sizes
 
07:13:58.150 --> 07:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
some are written some are not some are
 
07:13:59.990 --> 07:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
enacted through local laws while others
 
07:14:02.548 --> 07:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
masquerade as welcoming resolutions some
 
07:14:04.868 --> 07:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
even appear as internal
 
07:14:07.030 --> 07:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
policies for law enforcement agencies
 
07:14:10.310 --> 07:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
however they generally bar
 
07:14:12.390 --> 07:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
state or local officials including law
 
07:14:15.350 --> 07:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement from asking lawfully
 
07:14:17.030 --> 07:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
stopped or detained individuals about
 
07:14:18.948 --> 07:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
their status
 
07:14:18.958 --> 07:14:19.750 align:start position:0%
their status
or

07:14:19.750 --> 07:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:14:22.070 --> 07:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
reporting or otherwise cooperating with
 
07:14:24.548 --> 07:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
federal immigration officers
 
07:14:26.868 --> 07:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of how they're enacted or
 
07:14:29.350 --> 07:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
what form they take the common factor is
 
07:14:31.990 --> 07:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
sanctuaries place a greater emphasis on
 
07:14:34.390 --> 07:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
the welfare of illegal aliens than the
 
07:14:36.868 --> 07:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
welfare and safety of citizens and legal
 
07:14:36.878 --> 07:14:38.628 align:start position:0%
welfare and safety of citizens and legal
immigrants

07:14:38.628 --> 07:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
07:14:40.548 --> 07:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cities and municipalities
 
07:14:42.788 --> 07:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
have declared themselves welcoming they
 
07:14:44.310 --> 07:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
claim that they don't interfere with
 
07:14:46.310 --> 07:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
federal law enforcement but that's
 
07:14:49.350 --> 07:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
simply a fig leaf
 
07:14:52.150 --> 07:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
welcoming or sanctuary cities actively
 
07:14:53.830 --> 07:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
impede the enforcement of our federal
 
07:14:56.150 --> 07:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and often attempt to
 
07:14:58.548 --> 07:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
block free communication between state
 
07:14:59.990 --> 07:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and local officials and federal

07:15:04.868 --> 07:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
since 2017 new hampshire in new

lime manchester hanover and lebanon that
 
07:15:16.948 --> 07:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
do not call themselves necessarily

sanctuary cities yet their their
 
07:15:22.150 --> 07:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
practices make them function as such
 
07:15:24.548 --> 07:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
enacting 1266 will ensure these
 
07:15:26.628 --> 07:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions cannot prohibit or
 
07:15:29.110 --> 07:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
restrict communication with immigration

unfortunately

illegal aliens that reside in sanctuary

opponents of anti-sanctuary policies
 
07:18:42.070 --> 07:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
justify shielding illegal aliens from
 
07:18:43.910 --> 07:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
our immigration laws by saying it's
 
07:18:46.388 --> 07:18:46.398 align:start position:0%
necessary for law enforcement to build

trust within the community
 
07:18:51.430 --> 07:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
however state and local cooperation with

ice does not reduce the number of

non-citizens reporting crimes or coming

07:18:59.670 --> 07:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
as mentioned besides the fact that
 
07:19:01.990 --> 07:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
anonymous tips can be given there are
 
07:19:03.990 --> 07:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
already a number of programs that
 
07:19:06.708 --> 07:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
state and state local police can use to
 
07:19:09.350 --> 07:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
encourage victim and witness cooperation
 
07:19:11.910 --> 07:19:11.920 align:start position:0%

prosecution of criminals

they may qualify for u t s or vawa

in the u.s
 
07:19:26.468 --> 07:19:26.478 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policies actually prevent
 
07:19:28.708 --> 07:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens of crime from taking
 
07:19:32.468 --> 07:19:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:34.150 --> 07:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
additionally according to a recent

shows that immigrant victimizations are
 
07:19:46.230 --> 07:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
just as likely and in some cases more
 
07:19:48.628 --> 07:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
likely to be reported to police than

07:20:11.830 --> 07:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
finally sanctuary policies tell

individuals that despite violating
 
07:20:15.990 --> 07:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
federal laws law enforcement and other
 
07:20:17.910 --> 07:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
government officials will ignore them
 
07:20:19.670 --> 07:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
just because the regulation of
 
07:20:21.750 --> 07:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
immigration is a federal issue doesn't
 
07:20:23.190 --> 07:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
mean the state and local enforcement
 
07:20:25.110 --> 07:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
agencies must overlook immigration
 
07:20:27.590 --> 07:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
violations that harm their communities
 
07:20:29.350 --> 07:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with
 
07:20:31.750 --> 07:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
sanctuary cities which act as a magnet
 
07:20:34.628 --> 07:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
for illegal immigration according to

07:20:43.830 --> 07:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that takes into account the amount
 
07:20:46.948 --> 07:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
of money they spend in taxes
 
07:20:49.510 --> 07:20:49.520 align:start position:0%

07:22:26.070 --> 07:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
back in time and fix that but i do
 
07:22:27.590 --> 07:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe would be unfair now to strictly
 
07:22:30.708 --> 07:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
enforce it on this one witness
 
07:22:33.910 --> 07:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:37.110 --> 07:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
i i personally um don't know if you need
 
07:22:39.030 --> 07:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
to be wearing an orange badge
 
07:22:40.628 --> 07:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
um but if
 
07:22:41.990 --> 07:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's the case would you consider
 
07:22:43.830 --> 07:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
looking into it
 
07:22:47.430 --> 07:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:48.788 --> 07:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
the questions are supposed to be asked
 
07:22:51.270 --> 07:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
to ask or obtain information about the
 
07:22:53.110 --> 07:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill or information relating to their
 
07:22:53.120 --> 07:22:55.590 align:start position:0%
bill or information relating to their
testimony

07:22:55.590 --> 07:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:22:55.600 --> 07:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
testimony
that

07:23:00.070 --> 07:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:03.750 --> 07:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:05.430 --> 07:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
07:23:07.830 --> 07:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair since i mentioned
 
07:23:09.590 --> 07:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
this earlier i wanted to give you the
 
07:23:11.750 --> 07:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address this
 
07:23:14.548 --> 07:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
so fair has been labeled a hate group by
 
07:23:16.788 --> 07:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
the southern poverty law center since
 
07:23:16.798 --> 07:23:18.230 align:start position:0%
the southern poverty law center since
2008

07:23:18.230 --> 07:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
2008
 
07:23:21.430 --> 07:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
for its ties to white supremacist groups
 
07:23:25.190 --> 07:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
and attacks on non-white immigrants
 
07:23:27.430 --> 07:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
how does it feel
 
07:23:30.388 --> 07:23:30.398 align:start position:0%
uh being a part of a group known to be a
 
07:23:30.398 --> 07:23:31.430 align:start position:0%
uh being a part of a group known to be a
hatred

07:23:31.430 --> 07:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
hatred
 
07:23:33.350 --> 07:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
all right excuse me so i will address it
 
07:23:34.388 --> 07:23:34.398 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
07:23:36.548 --> 07:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
i'm asking starting not to answer
 
07:23:38.310 --> 07:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
respond to the question i'm
 
07:23:40.628 --> 07:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
getting the question out of order
 
07:23:43.830 --> 07:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
can i rephrase it mr cool i just i with
 
07:23:45.910 --> 07:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
the prior member that asked the question
 
07:23:47.830 --> 07:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
the questions are related to the
 
07:23:47.840 --> 07:23:48.868 align:start position:0%
the questions are related to the
substance

07:23:48.868 --> 07:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
substance
 
07:23:51.510 --> 07:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill in the substance of the
 
07:23:53.430 --> 07:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
testimony provided
 
07:23:55.670 --> 07:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
by the witness
 
07:23:58.150 --> 07:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
i am ruling that that is not related
 
07:24:00.070 --> 07:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
to either the testimony provided or the
 
07:24:02.070 --> 07:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
bill itself okay that's fair may i ask
 
07:24:07.830 --> 07:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:10.788 --> 07:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
um i am a representative from concord
 
07:24:13.110 --> 07:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
we're not too far from my district's
 
07:24:13.120 --> 07:24:15.110 align:start position:0%
we're not too far from my district's
border

07:24:15.110 --> 07:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
border
 
07:24:17.990 --> 07:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
so as someone who doesn't live in new
 
07:24:20.788 --> 07:24:20.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire do you feel you understand the
 
07:24:22.230 --> 07:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
local state
 
07:24:24.388 --> 07:24:24.398 align:start position:0%
laws and
 
07:24:26.548 --> 07:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
local community laws and our high
 
07:24:28.388 --> 07:24:28.398 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
07:24:29.830 --> 07:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to deem that question on order
 
07:24:31.190 --> 07:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
as well we
 
07:24:33.510 --> 07:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
have consistently have had members of
 
07:24:37.510 --> 07:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the public who reside out of state
 
07:24:38.788 --> 07:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
at least in this committee i don't want
 
07:24:40.070 --> 07:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
to speak for every committee but it's
 
07:24:42.230 --> 07:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
happened quite frequently so again if we
 
07:24:44.628 --> 07:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
were going to
 
07:24:46.708 --> 07:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to rephrase that since
 
07:24:49.350 --> 07:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
this impacts our taxes i thought maybe
 
07:24:53.030 --> 07:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
she had an expertise in some way to know
 
07:24:54.548 --> 07:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
i'm deeming the question out of order as
 
07:24:56.388 --> 07:24:56.398 align:start position:0%
well okay that is your right as chair
 
07:25:00.310 --> 07:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:01.750 --> 07:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
may i just mention something on
 
07:25:01.760 --> 07:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
may i just mention something on
detainers

07:25:03.350 --> 07:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
detainers
 
07:25:05.430 --> 07:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
or is that out of order where testimony
 
07:25:08.868 --> 07:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:10.468 --> 07:25:10.478 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight
 
07:25:20.310 --> 07:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:21.990 --> 07:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
recognize for a parliament parliamentary
 
07:25:23.670 --> 07:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
inquiry well you can tell me if that's
 
07:25:24.948 --> 07:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
07:25:26.708 --> 07:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
we've sat here all day and we've
 
07:25:28.310 --> 07:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
listened this evening listening to
 
07:25:30.548 --> 07:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
testimony about that terminology a
 
07:25:32.708 --> 07:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
little illegal alien
 
07:25:34.948 --> 07:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
and the fact that you allow people and
 
07:25:36.868 --> 07:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
that was part of what
 
07:25:38.948 --> 07:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
we were talking about here
 
07:25:40.948 --> 07:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
you have the right not to allow that
 
07:25:42.868 --> 07:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
type of testimony that's so offensive to
 
07:25:45.110 --> 07:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
many people in this room
 
07:25:47.510 --> 07:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and and i'm very serious about this
 
07:25:50.070 --> 07:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
because enough is enough
 
07:25:50.080 --> 07:25:50.868 align:start position:0%
because enough is enough
wait

07:25:50.868 --> 07:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
wait
 
07:25:53.990 --> 07:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
hear me out no please hear me out okay
 
07:25:55.910 --> 07:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's the same way that we're sitting in
 
07:25:57.590 --> 07:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
this room and someone wants to use the
 
07:26:00.708 --> 07:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
n-word okay it's just as offensive so
 
07:26:03.110 --> 07:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that you know we have to
 
07:26:04.708 --> 07:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
do better than this that we represent
 
07:26:07.590 --> 07:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
the people all the people
 
07:26:09.670 --> 07:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
as a committee before i respond to that
 
07:26:10.948 --> 07:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
i just asked that the members of the i'm
 
07:26:12.948 --> 07:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
going to call the room to order again
 
07:26:14.150 --> 07:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'm asking
 
07:26:15.750 --> 07:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
the members in the public to not be
 
07:26:17.190 --> 07:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
yelling stuff out it makes it very
 
07:26:19.270 --> 07:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
difficult for the community to do its
 
07:26:22.628 --> 07:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:26.548 --> 07:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:28.310 --> 07:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent that that was a point of
 
07:26:30.948 --> 07:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
order it would it should be early early
 
07:26:32.788 --> 07:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
but i'll address it
 
07:26:35.190 --> 07:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
i understand that some some people may
 
07:26:37.270 --> 07:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
find the term offensive
 
07:26:39.510 --> 07:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
illegal alien however in under federal
 
07:26:42.150 --> 07:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
law that that term is constantly listed
 
07:26:44.548 --> 07:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
as a legal term i'm not saying that i
 
07:26:46.468 --> 07:26:46.478 align:start position:0%
agree that they shouldn't change it but
 
07:26:47.910 --> 07:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's on that is something that is
 
07:26:50.150 --> 07:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
listed under several laws so when
 
07:26:53.030 --> 07:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
someone does make that
 
07:26:54.788 --> 07:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not i'm not the one that wrote
 
07:26:56.548 --> 07:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
the federal laws i'm just explaining i'm
 
07:26:58.468 --> 07:26:58.478 align:start position:0%
just explaining that when people do use
 
07:26:58.478 --> 07:26:59.830 align:start position:0%
just explaining that when people do use
it

07:26:59.830 --> 07:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:27:02.150 --> 07:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
in this context
 
07:27:04.310 --> 07:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
it is still a legal classification i'm
 
07:27:05.510 --> 07:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
not saying that they shouldn't change
 
07:27:11.110 --> 07:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:12.788 --> 07:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
my point is it's hard to i wouldn't rule
 
07:27:14.868 --> 07:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
someone out of order in for using in
 
07:27:20.468 --> 07:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:22.070 --> 07:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
you have the power in this room to make
 
07:27:25.190 --> 07:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
that type of decision can say we
 
07:27:27.670 --> 07:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
the terminology is not um welcome today
 
07:27:29.030 --> 07:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
07:27:30.708 --> 07:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
whatever you need to say
 
07:27:32.708 --> 07:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
so that it would not be offensive to
 
07:27:34.628 --> 07:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
everyone sitting in this room
 
07:27:36.548 --> 07:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm saying the best way to
 
07:27:38.388 --> 07:27:38.398 align:start position:0%
address that would be to contact our
 
07:27:40.310 --> 07:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
federal delegation and have them sponsor
 
07:27:41.670 --> 07:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislation at the federal level to
 
07:27:43.510 --> 07:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
remove that language from the federal
 
07:27:45.910 --> 07:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
laws because the people who do use it i
 
07:27:47.590 --> 07:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
understand that what people do find it
 
07:27:50.388 --> 07:27:50.398 align:start position:0%
offensive but when it's written in law
 
07:27:51.750 --> 07:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the confusion comes
 
07:27:51.760 --> 07:27:52.628 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the confusion comes
from

07:27:52.628 --> 07:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:27:54.948 --> 07:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate i appreciate the point
 
07:27:54.958 --> 07:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate i appreciate the point
made

07:27:55.750 --> 07:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
07:27:57.750 --> 07:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
by the rep mr chairman can i make a
 
07:27:59.270 --> 07:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
point of order please
 
07:28:00.868 --> 07:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
representative burt you were recognized
 
07:28:02.468 --> 07:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
for your point of order please state it
 
07:28:04.628 --> 07:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
07:28:07.750 --> 07:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
i know i have questions of
 
07:28:09.910 --> 07:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
the person given the testimony at this
 
07:28:11.510 --> 07:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
point so are we going to do point of
 
07:28:13.350 --> 07:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
orders all night or can we get back to
 
07:28:14.788 --> 07:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
the business and do point of orders
 
07:28:18.868 --> 07:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:18.878 --> 07:28:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
i

07:28:19.670 --> 07:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:28:21.510 --> 07:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
respectfully i'm not sure that's a point
 
07:28:23.830 --> 07:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
of order correct probably so your point
 
07:28:27.110 --> 07:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
of order is also out of order thank you
 
07:28:28.548 --> 07:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
it's a parliamentary inquiry it sounds
 
07:28:30.310 --> 07:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
like and
 
07:28:31.910 --> 07:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
a point of order has to be addressed
 
07:28:34.628 --> 07:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
when raised and i could actually
 
07:28:36.230 --> 07:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
find a point of void to be dilatory
 
07:28:38.070 --> 07:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
which i'm very i'm considering it i
 
07:28:39.190 --> 07:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
don't find
 
07:28:39.200 --> 07:28:40.230 align:start position:0%
don't find
the

07:28:40.230 --> 07:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:28:41.830 --> 07:28:41.840 align:start position:0%

taking my question you cited a lot of
data

data
 
07:29:35.670 --> 07:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
on the national level but i was
 
07:29:38.230 --> 07:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if your organization had
 
07:29:41.110 --> 07:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
data that's new hampshire specific
 
07:29:43.430 --> 07:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and i noted just from the national
 
07:29:45.030 --> 07:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
numbers you gave me do you have anything
 
07:29:47.270 --> 07:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
specific to new hampshire on
 
07:29:49.750 --> 07:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh the number of taxpayers
 
07:29:49.760 --> 07:29:50.548 align:start position:0%
uh the number of taxpayers
who

07:29:50.548 --> 07:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
who
 
07:29:53.110 --> 07:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
or taxes spent in new hampshire
 
07:29:55.910 --> 07:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
or paid by
 
07:29:58.548 --> 07:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know you know the people
 
07:30:00.788 --> 07:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
jobs they hold how many jobs are held in
 
07:30:02.070 --> 07:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:30:04.628 --> 07:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
and the percent of arrests in new
 
07:30:04.638 --> 07:30:05.670 align:start position:0%
and the percent of arrests in new
hampshire

07:30:05.670 --> 07:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:30:05.680 --> 07:30:06.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire
from

07:30:06.350 --> 07:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:30:09.430 --> 07:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants
 
07:30:11.590 --> 07:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um the
 
07:30:14.388 --> 07:30:14.398 align:start position:0%
number of arrests is very hard data to
 
07:30:16.230 --> 07:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
get a hold of
 
07:30:18.548 --> 07:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
it's not always reported so it is
 
07:30:21.830 --> 07:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to get a hold of with respect
 
07:30:21.840 --> 07:30:22.628 align:start position:0%
difficult to get a hold of with respect
to

07:30:22.628 --> 07:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:30:24.868 --> 07:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
the cost to new hampshire i did cite
 
07:30:27.670 --> 07:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
that it was 86.9 million dollars is what
 
07:30:29.750 --> 07:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
it cost after taxes
 
07:30:32.150 --> 07:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a 132 billion
 
07:30:35.948 --> 07:30:35.958 align:start position:0%
nationwide and then 40 uh i'm sorry
 
07:30:38.310 --> 07:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
86.9 million
 
07:30:40.868 --> 07:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and that's after you
 
07:30:42.708 --> 07:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
account for all the taxes that they do
 
07:30:42.718 --> 07:30:44.708 align:start position:0%
account for all the taxes that they do
pay

07:30:44.708 --> 07:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
pay
 
07:30:46.310 --> 07:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
07:30:48.388 --> 07:30:48.398 align:start position:0%
mr chair you recognize for a follow-up
 
07:30:51.190 --> 07:30:51.200 align:start position:0%

question but i'm sorry it was it was
 
07:30:57.030 --> 07:30:57.040 align:start position:0%

say undocumented immigrants excuse me
 
07:31:13.510 --> 07:31:13.520 align:start position:0%

07:31:13.520 --> 07:31:14.310 align:start position:0%
it's not we don't need to imply anything
that's

07:31:14.310 --> 07:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
07:31:15.830 --> 07:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
that issue has been addressed already
 
07:31:17.910 --> 07:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just didn't want to use
 
07:31:19.670 --> 07:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
the term that that people receive you
 
07:31:21.510 --> 07:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
can use the term undocumented i use that
 
07:31:22.708 --> 07:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
term that's
 
07:31:25.350 --> 07:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
okay i understand okay thank you so do
 
07:31:26.708 --> 07:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
you know how many jobs in new hampshire
 
07:31:29.430 --> 07:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
are held by undocumented immigrants so i
 
07:31:31.670 --> 07:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
do not have that statistic
 
07:31:33.990 --> 07:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
reality says there should be no jobs
 
07:31:35.910 --> 07:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
held by those here illegally according
 
07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
to federal law
 
07:31:42.230 --> 07:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:43.350 --> 07:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
07:31:47.830 --> 07:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
recognized to ask the witness a question
 
07:31:49.510 --> 07:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair that's exactly what i
 
07:31:52.468 --> 07:31:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:54.388 --> 07:31:54.398 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your testimony earlier
 
07:31:58.548 --> 07:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
you gave a list of cities in
 
07:32:00.310 --> 07:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
07:32:02.548 --> 07:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
that you said i believe
 
07:32:04.150 --> 07:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
act like
 
07:32:05.510 --> 07:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
07:32:07.270 --> 07:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
no i mean i've lost the term the
 
07:32:09.430 --> 07:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
sanctuary cities
 
07:32:11.270 --> 07:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh but are not
 
07:32:13.750 --> 07:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if the data that you
 
07:32:15.110 --> 07:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
used to
 
07:32:17.430 --> 07:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
make that statement
 
07:32:20.230 --> 07:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
was based on an examination of written
 
07:32:22.868 --> 07:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
policies that they have or could some of
 
07:32:26.310 --> 07:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
those policies just have been verbal
 
07:32:28.948 --> 07:32:28.958 align:start position:0%
policies like we don't have a lot of
 
07:32:31.670 --> 07:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
money so your priority is go to the most
 
07:32:33.910 --> 07:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
serious things and and kind of leave the
 
07:32:36.468 --> 07:32:36.478 align:start position:0%
immigration things like that were they
 
07:32:39.030 --> 07:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
written or verbality no
 
07:32:40.948 --> 07:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question they were
 
07:32:43.270 --> 07:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
written policies um
 
07:32:43.280 --> 07:32:44.948 align:start position:0%
written policies um
mostly

07:32:44.948 --> 07:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
07:32:47.910 --> 07:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
and they were based on the fact that we
 
07:32:49.350 --> 07:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
had looked at
 
07:32:51.750 --> 07:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually had to research into the states
 
07:32:53.750 --> 07:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
and look at what the statements were
 
07:32:55.750 --> 07:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
so while they don't call themselves
 
07:32:58.788 --> 07:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
sanctuary in the in the in the term they
 
07:33:01.510 --> 07:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
are acting like sanctuary cities and
 
07:33:04.788 --> 07:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
they have policies written that have uh
 
07:33:06.150 --> 07:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
interfered with
 
07:33:08.230 --> 07:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
um or prohibited communication free
 
07:33:08.240 --> 07:33:09.510 align:start position:0%
um or prohibited communication free
communication

07:33:09.510 --> 07:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
communication
 
07:33:10.868 --> 07:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
um on
 
07:33:12.628 --> 07:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
immigration issues
 
07:33:16.310 --> 07:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up mr chair
 
07:33:17.270 --> 07:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
07:33:18.708 --> 07:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow-up question
 
07:33:20.468 --> 07:33:20.478 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:33:20.478 --> 07:33:21.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

07:33:21.510 --> 07:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:23.670 --> 07:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion that the way this
 
07:33:25.670 --> 07:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is written where it says
 
07:33:27.910 --> 07:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited from acting in any way that
 
07:33:29.510 --> 07:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
would discourage
 
07:33:31.430 --> 07:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement of federal immigration
 
07:33:31.440 --> 07:33:33.030 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement of federal immigration
laws

07:33:33.030 --> 07:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
laws
 
07:33:35.430 --> 07:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this law would then
 
07:33:35.440 --> 07:33:36.708 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this law would then
prohibit

07:33:36.708 --> 07:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
07:33:39.510 --> 07:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
cities that don't have written policies
 
07:33:42.948 --> 07:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
but they say the same kind of thing that
 
07:33:45.750 --> 07:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the money and and don't
 
07:33:47.830 --> 07:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
do the most important laws now and don't
 
07:33:50.070 --> 07:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
do the immigration stuff
 
07:33:53.750 --> 07:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
that that kind of verbal
 
07:33:56.468 --> 07:33:56.478 align:start position:0%
non-written documentation
 
07:33:59.510 --> 07:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
would also prohibit those cities from
 
07:34:01.830 --> 07:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
07:34:04.830 --> 07:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
tell their police that that is their
 
07:34:08.868 --> 07:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
policy if it's from the council
 
07:34:11.430 --> 07:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
or or local governments basically
 
07:34:13.750 --> 07:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
verbally telling the law enforcement
 
07:34:16.070 --> 07:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they can't enforce or communicate
 
07:34:18.310 --> 07:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes that's an issue because you are
 
07:34:19.990 --> 07:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
prohibiting free communication and
 
07:34:20.000 --> 07:34:21.190 align:start position:0%
prohibiting free communication and
cooperation

07:34:21.190 --> 07:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
07:34:21.200 --> 07:34:22.070 align:start position:0%

07:35:14.628 --> 07:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:17.430 --> 07:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
what was you said one million people
 
07:35:20.708 --> 07:35:20.718 align:start position:0%
have final orders of removal
 
07:35:23.270 --> 07:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah how many undocumented individuals
 
07:35:25.350 --> 07:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
did the states let in last year and of
 
07:35:28.468 --> 07:35:28.478 align:start position:0%
that number how many were criminals
 
07:35:30.708 --> 07:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
you're asking how many i'm sorry for
 
07:35:32.788 --> 07:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes you're asking me
 
07:35:34.628 --> 07:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
how many um
 
07:35:34.638 --> 07:35:35.510 align:start position:0%
how many um
people

07:35:35.510 --> 07:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:35:39.190 --> 07:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire led in illegally
 
07:35:42.388 --> 07:35:42.398 align:start position:0%
how many undocumented people did the
 
07:35:43.990 --> 07:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
because you're national right you can
 
07:35:46.948 --> 07:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
just tell us uh the in the united states
 
07:35:49.510 --> 07:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
if if you have that data how many
 
07:35:49.520 --> 07:35:51.110 align:start position:0%
if if you have that data how many
undocumented

07:35:51.110 --> 07:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
undocumented
 
07:35:53.830 --> 07:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
did we let in into the united states of
 
07:35:57.030 --> 07:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
america last year and of that number how
 
07:35:59.830 --> 07:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
many were actual criminals because this
 
07:36:01.750 --> 07:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
is all based off of their criminals
 
07:36:01.760 --> 07:36:03.430 align:start position:0%
is all based off of their criminals
right

07:36:03.430 --> 07:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:36:05.110 --> 07:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is these are the
 
07:36:06.948 --> 07:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
people that we already know have final
 
07:36:08.868 --> 07:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
orders they've gone through the process
 
07:36:11.190 --> 07:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
and they have final orders of removal as
 
07:36:13.990 --> 07:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
far as those who have been
 
07:36:15.910 --> 07:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
admitted illegally i don't believe that
 
07:36:17.830 --> 07:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government admits anyone
 
07:36:21.270 --> 07:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
illegally into our country but there are
 
07:36:23.590 --> 07:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that anticipate the numbers of
 
07:36:27.030 --> 07:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
people who are here illegally and i know
 
07:36:29.750 --> 07:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
last fiscal fiscal year
 
07:36:32.548 --> 07:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
it was on track to end with 200 or i'm
 
07:36:34.150 --> 07:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
sorry 2 million people being here
 
07:36:34.160 --> 07:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
sorry 2 million people being here
illegally

07:36:35.510 --> 07:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
07:36:37.430 --> 07:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
out of those
 
07:36:39.510 --> 07:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you how many have criminal
 
07:36:39.520 --> 07:36:40.708 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you how many have criminal
records

07:36:40.708 --> 07:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
records
 
07:36:44.388 --> 07:36:44.398 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that ice or
 
07:36:46.948 --> 07:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
cbp even have the numbers of those
 
07:36:49.350 --> 07:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
at this point who have criminal records
 
07:36:51.990 --> 07:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
from those being admitted
 
07:36:54.628 --> 07:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
who have entered our country illegally
 
07:36:58.070 --> 07:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:59.510 --> 07:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative knight you recognize for
 
07:37:01.670 --> 07:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question thank you chair um
 
07:37:04.230 --> 07:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
so we don't have an accurate number of
 
07:37:06.070 --> 07:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
how many were criminals but we need a
 
07:37:06.080 --> 07:37:07.110 align:start position:0%
how many were criminals but we need a
law

07:37:07.110 --> 07:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
07:37:10.388 --> 07:37:10.398 align:start position:0%
to prevent these criminals from entering
 
07:37:12.230 --> 07:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
is there a question there is that true
 
07:37:14.468 --> 07:37:14.478 align:start position:0%
you you feel like we need a law but you
 
07:37:16.468 --> 07:37:16.478 align:start position:0%
don't even have the data to prove that
 
07:37:19.430 --> 07:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:22.548 --> 07:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that's a question
 
07:37:25.030 --> 07:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm just trying to keep the committee
 
07:37:26.708 --> 07:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
in order without letting it get out of
 
07:37:28.388 --> 07:37:28.398 align:start position:0%
hand so i'm gonna
 
07:37:29.910 --> 07:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
not give much leeway for the rest of the
 
07:37:29.920 --> 07:37:36.150 align:start position:0%
not give much leeway for the rest of the
day

07:37:36.150 --> 07:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:37.990 --> 07:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative burt you were recognized
 
07:37:41.590 --> 07:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:43.270 --> 07:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
i was going to start in state but ever
 
07:37:44.948 --> 07:37:44.958 align:start position:0%
since we're talking about
 
07:37:47.830 --> 07:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
the nation um i did want to mention that
 
07:37:47.840 --> 07:37:50.708 align:start position:0%
the nation um i did want to mention that
too

07:37:50.708 --> 07:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
too
 
07:37:53.750 --> 07:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
what will this bill do
 
07:37:56.788 --> 07:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
with the current administration
 
07:37:59.110 --> 07:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
which i believe is following what
 
07:38:02.230 --> 07:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
president obama and president trump are
 
07:38:04.070 --> 07:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much doing you know the current
 
07:38:06.388 --> 07:38:06.398 align:start position:0%
administration is following their mostly
 
07:38:07.830 --> 07:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
their footsteps
 
07:38:09.590 --> 07:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
um with detaining people in jail and
 
07:38:10.468 --> 07:38:10.478 align:start position:0%
stuff like
 
07:38:11.830 --> 07:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
like that when they come across the
 
07:38:14.388 --> 07:38:14.398 align:start position:0%
border illegally
 
07:38:16.628 --> 07:38:16.638 align:start position:0%
what will this bill do
 
07:38:18.310 --> 07:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the current administration what
 
07:38:20.708 --> 07:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
07:38:23.190 --> 07:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
so uh with the current administration
 
07:38:25.030 --> 07:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
the current administration hasn't been
 
07:38:25.040 --> 07:38:25.830 align:start position:0%
the current administration hasn't been
um

07:38:25.830 --> 07:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:38:28.310 --> 07:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
enforcing many of our immigration laws
 
07:38:32.070 --> 07:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to this bill it will
 
07:38:34.310 --> 07:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
enforce the rule of law and make sure
 
07:38:34.320 --> 07:38:36.150 align:start position:0%
enforce the rule of law and make sure
that

07:38:36.150 --> 07:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:38:37.830 --> 07:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
we are not acting as a magnet for
 
07:38:40.070 --> 07:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration here in the state it
 
07:38:43.030 --> 07:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
will ensure that there is opportunity to
 
07:38:45.030 --> 07:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
communicate and cooperate with our
 
07:38:47.510 --> 07:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
federal officials ultimately it is the
 
07:38:49.910 --> 07:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal officials determination on
 
07:38:52.310 --> 07:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
whether they pursue someone who is here
 
07:38:54.948 --> 07:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
illegally it is their domain not the
 
07:38:58.388 --> 07:38:58.398 align:start position:0%
state's domain but to be able to
 
07:39:00.310 --> 07:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
keep the chain the lines of
 
07:39:02.548 --> 07:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
communication open and not prohibit that
 
07:39:05.110 --> 07:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
communication which some localities have
 
07:39:05.120 --> 07:39:06.548 align:start position:0%
communication which some localities have
uh

07:39:06.548 --> 07:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:39:09.030 --> 07:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
done is what's important all right and a
 
07:39:11.430 --> 07:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman
 
07:39:14.388 --> 07:39:14.398 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:39:17.830 --> 07:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
in this four line bill one sentence
 
07:39:17.840 --> 07:39:20.150 align:start position:0%
in this four line bill one sentence
basically

07:39:20.150 --> 07:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
basically
 
07:39:21.910 --> 07:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
i heard a lot of talk
 
07:39:21.920 --> 07:39:23.110 align:start position:0%
i heard a lot of talk
that

07:39:23.110 --> 07:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:39:24.948 --> 07:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's going to tell
 
07:39:26.468 --> 07:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
local police
 
07:39:28.548 --> 07:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
and state police if they pull somebody
 
07:39:30.948 --> 07:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
over they can question their immigration
 
07:39:34.150 --> 07:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where that is in here
 
07:39:37.190 --> 07:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
this bill from my reading of the bill
 
07:39:39.430 --> 07:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
will give them the discretion if they
 
07:39:42.388 --> 07:39:42.398 align:start position:0%
choose to ask about immigration status
 
07:39:44.150 --> 07:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
or it will
 
07:39:46.868 --> 07:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
allow them not to it's their discretion
 
07:39:49.590 --> 07:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
from what i can see the operative word
 
07:39:52.388 --> 07:39:52.398 align:start position:0%
are implementing policies
 
07:39:55.750 --> 07:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
so if an individual is stopping someone
 
07:39:58.230 --> 07:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis they have the
 
07:39:59.910 --> 07:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use their discretion
 
07:40:01.510 --> 07:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's what you want your law
 
07:40:03.510 --> 07:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to do and not
 
07:40:05.430 --> 07:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
have a blanket prohibition
 
07:40:07.430 --> 07:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
that they can't and just one short
 
07:40:15.590 --> 07:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:17.270 --> 07:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
you may be recognized for a follow-up
 
07:40:20.628 --> 07:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
07:40:24.230 --> 07:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
do they currently have that right
 
07:40:26.310 --> 07:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
in most places in new hampshire they do

manager from this establishment
 
07:46:52.388 --> 07:46:52.398 align:start position:0%

of himself
 
07:46:55.120 --> 07:46:56.548 align:start position:0%
of himself

07:46:56.548 --> 07:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:46:59.030 --> 07:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
brought back flashback
 
07:47:03.190 --> 07:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
from my sexual assault when i was little
 
07:47:06.150 --> 07:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
it was so hard for me to show my husband
 
07:47:09.990 --> 07:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
what was happening at that moment
 
07:47:11.270 --> 07:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
but i was
 
07:47:13.830 --> 07:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
i talked to some of my friends
 
07:47:15.510 --> 07:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
and my friends told me that i should be
 
07:47:17.430 --> 07:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
open to my husband
 
07:47:21.590 --> 07:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:24.948 --> 07:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
my husband told me that i have the right
 
07:47:28.628 --> 07:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:31.430 --> 07:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
consequences to this manager
 
07:47:33.110 --> 07:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
as a state representative i was
 
07:47:33.120 --> 07:47:35.110 align:start position:0%
as a state representative i was
embarrassed

07:47:35.110 --> 07:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
embarrassed
 
07:47:37.510 --> 07:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
to evolve into the police and show them
 
07:47:40.230 --> 07:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
what this manager sent me a new picture
 
07:47:42.468 --> 07:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
of his powers
 
07:47:44.788 --> 07:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
and after that he sent me a picture of
 
07:47:47.910 --> 07:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
him drinking tequila shots
 
07:47:52.310 --> 07:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
i felt that i was sexually soul again
 
07:47:55.350 --> 07:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
so that's why i support
 
07:47:57.430 --> 07:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill because
 
07:47:59.590 --> 07:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
victims like myself we need to be
 
07:48:04.548 --> 07:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
protected for this not to happen again
 
07:48:07.430 --> 07:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly painful for someone who
 
07:48:07.440 --> 07:48:09.270 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly painful for someone who
already

07:48:09.270 --> 07:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
already
 
07:48:12.628 --> 07:48:12.638 align:start position:0%

07:48:14.708 --> 07:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
assault and you feel like you've been
 
07:48:17.910 --> 07:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
abused again by a picture sent
 
07:48:22.150 --> 07:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:24.230 --> 07:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
07:48:26.150 --> 07:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
he called me the next day
 
07:48:27.990 --> 07:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
he sent me a text
 
07:48:30.548 --> 07:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
asking me if i was still willing to take
 
07:48:32.708 --> 07:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
the job and work for him
 
07:48:35.430 --> 07:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
hot in the world i was going to be able
 
07:48:37.830 --> 07:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
to work for someone who already sent me
 
07:48:40.388 --> 07:48:40.398 align:start position:0%
a new picture of his parts
 
07:48:42.468 --> 07:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
and then make me feel like already
 
07:48:45.670 --> 07:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
was getting sexual assault again
 
07:48:53.430 --> 07:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:55.830 --> 07:48:55.840 align:start position:0%

the other body

and went to committee of conference and
 
07:49:18.070 --> 07:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the questions that were that
 
07:49:19.750 --> 07:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
were brought up earlier today whenever
 
07:49:21.430 --> 07:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
we reheard the bill by the
 
07:49:23.350 --> 07:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative that resubmitted it um
 
07:49:24.468 --> 07:49:24.478 align:start position:0%
were actually
 
07:49:25.990 --> 07:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
addressed in the committee of conference
 
07:49:27.030 --> 07:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:49:29.670 --> 07:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the attorney i believe spoke to
 
07:49:33.030 --> 07:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
so i i just wanted to um
 
07:49:38.230 --> 07:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:39.430 --> 07:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and for the
 
07:49:41.750 --> 07:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
members who weren't president for the
 
07:49:43.270 --> 07:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference we only had in
 
07:49:44.788 --> 07:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
the bill last term the
 
07:49:46.628 --> 07:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
prime spawn sponsor the representative
 
07:49:46.638 --> 07:49:48.070 align:start position:0%
prime spawn sponsor the representative
actually

07:49:48.070 --> 07:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
07:49:50.070 --> 07:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
caught a drafting error that
 
07:49:51.590 --> 07:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
saved us all from an embarrassment
 
07:49:53.270 --> 07:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
because it may have there was some talk
 
07:49:56.388 --> 07:49:56.398 align:start position:0%
of what maybe that would have legalized
 
07:49:58.468 --> 07:49:58.478 align:start position:0%
or made it a violation to send
 
07:50:00.230 --> 07:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
lewd images of a minor which is not the
 
07:50:01.430 --> 07:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the
 
07:50:03.270 --> 07:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor so it was a very good catch by
 
07:50:05.430 --> 07:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
the representative filed this
 
07:50:07.270 --> 07:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
and uh who's not even a member of the
 
07:50:08.468 --> 07:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
committee but was on the committee of
 
07:50:10.230 --> 07:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
conference with us so again
 
07:50:11.510 --> 07:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
and she doesn't have a legal background
 
07:50:13.270 --> 07:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
so you have it was just an impressive
 
07:50:15.510 --> 07:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
catch so we were all thankful that she
 
07:50:17.430 --> 07:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
did that then refiled
 
07:50:19.510 --> 07:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
um the reason why this language was not
 
07:50:21.830 --> 07:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
accepted at that time was it really was
 
07:50:23.510 --> 07:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
the vetting process given what almost
 
07:50:24.788 --> 07:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
just happened
 
07:50:26.708 --> 07:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
so it's now gone through that process
 
07:50:26.718 --> 07:50:28.070 align:start position:0%
so it's now gone through that process
and

07:50:28.070 --> 07:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:50:29.670 --> 07:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
the encouragement is that you know
