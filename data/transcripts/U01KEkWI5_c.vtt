00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 28 um I would
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
recognize representative xen for a
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes I move
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
itl uh repen moves itl on Senate Bill 28
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
seconded by um represent I always call
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcarter um seconds uh I
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
would open up to any discussion
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
represent machine do you want to speak
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
to your motion uh yes so um I moved itl
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
um as many of you know that um this bill
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
was put in the budget that we recently
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
passed in May so there's really no
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
reason to pass this
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
legislation um I'm seeing some puzzle
 
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
looks so maybe there are some that
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that uh we um when we
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
received this bill and um and voted to
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
retain it um there were a number of
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions uh one of those
 
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
items was that uh we weren't sure
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
whether our acceptance of that bill
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
violated any of the
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
um any of the
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
historical uh committee requirements um
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
there are there are listed in the RSA
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the establishment of the historical
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
committee um criteria that um they
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of their duties is to
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
create criteria to accept um portraits
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we had never seen that CR criteria
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
so the concern was that we didn't want
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
to accept the bill without knowing
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
whether we would be violating any of
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
those criteria seemed logical to me uh
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
apparently those that were working on
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the budget um from the Senate
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
side had less concern about the criteria
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
of the historical committee and uh they
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
just went ahead and um and unbeknownst
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
to us put the bill and in its entirety
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
inside the budget um added the funding
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
so um it rendered our concerns moot at
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
that point so um with no nowhere else
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
for us to go it would seem illogical to
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
do anything except itl uh this
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
bill any problems uh further further
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
hargan I just veried you said was
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
correct and they actually the only thing
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate and then we changed we
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
accepted the in the conference committee
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
was uh to put the RSA that uh
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
establishes a joint historical committee
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
so you're so you're entirely right I
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
mean I there you go once one in a row
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
actually actually to remember Roger
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
Johnson who I believe was the first
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
African-American in the Hampshire house
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
I know my um one close close to it but
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
um this had nothing to do with uh with
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
who Rogers Johnson was or or anything
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
about it it was purely on the uh process
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
and the procedure um but I appreciate
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
your uh your comments he definitely
 
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
definitely deserves a portrait I vaguely
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
remember from when my father served in
 
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
remember from when my father served in
the

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
legislature uh you know almost half a
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
century ago so right he still remembered
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
good um so as far as we're concerned uh
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
it's taken care of um uh
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
honorable uh Johnson will be getting his
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
portrait has already been accepted I
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
Believe by the historical committee and
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh and so we can move on and and uh I
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
think um itl Senate Bill 28 um with that
 
00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:47.959 align:start position:0%

bills yes there's no reason is there any
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
objection to consent on
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
this none from me that's fine
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
y it's funny how
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
you when you do things so infrequently
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
and you're only doing it every couple
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
years I just had to stop and think
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
whether consent actually existed on
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
these I don't I don't recall we had
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
another issue earlier that we were
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out um and none of us
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
had remembered it ever happening before
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
so it it takes a while the little
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
chipmunks have to start running in the
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
wheel again I
 
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
think at any rate um so that's uh Senate
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 28 and that's probably our most um
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
um prod productive piece of work today
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I feel a little guilty for having
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
everyone come to conquer um on the on
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
the premise that we would be working on
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
four bills um but we're unprepared for
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually working on the remaining three
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
um one of
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
them has a um an
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh is in and has been
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
filed with OS but we don't have that
 
00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
filed with OS but we don't have that
Amendment

00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's that handles that one um
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that would be um Senate
 
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.990 align:start position:0%
and that would be um Senate
Bill

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
301 um Senate bill I mean Senate Bill 84
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
has been um requested by our leadership
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
um to hang on to because it relates to
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
work being ongoing with um the um the
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions and uh that we
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
have the special committee on committees
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
and commissions um and so that they're
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
asking us to uh put off action on that
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
bill just on the chance that there's
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
something that needs to go into that
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
bill as an amendment so we can't work on
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
that and the third one um is House Bill
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
157 that we retained that uh deals with
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
um The Joint Committee on legislative
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
facilities and sexual harassment
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
policies um and that one too
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
um was being um hopefully a subcommittee
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
set up by uh representative Pearson who
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
you'll see is not sitting in that seat
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
um right now um and we are waiting to
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
see um the amendment that um that
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee when it when it meets will
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
so we're we're out of work um so at the
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
moment um I apologize for uh for getting
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
everybody to conquered I thought we
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
would uh we were in great shape but then
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
it um through some lug nuts fell off the
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
wheel and and there's not much we can do
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
um I will ask however if there are times
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
um in the next two weeks that uh that
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
someone can come can let us know whether
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
your availability over the next couple
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
weeks if there's a problem in there um
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can get as much participation
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
as we can um having said that I guess I
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
want to thank the uh substitutes for uh
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
for participating and uh and I want to
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh publicly congratulate our our newest
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
member of legislative
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
Administration who's maybe asleep at the
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
moment um so I with if anyone has
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
anything else to add um otherwise I will
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
uh simply call for
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
again
