mike
 
00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
one okay there we go okay we're live
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
streaming here so be advised people are
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
watching maybe they're not but they
 
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
could be anyways
 
00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
and if you want to speak please uh uh
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
use the mic uh this is a work session
 
00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
on hb 1258 which is relative to the
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
implementation of the department of
 
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.550 align:start position:0%
implementation of the department of
energy

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
um we have a subcommittee and what we're
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is not necessarily
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
solve every possible
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
wrong or perceived wrong with uh h with
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
the way the thing is set up right now
 
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
but try to correct the things that we've
 
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
recognized that came out of hb2 they're
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
not working necessarily or may not work
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh i think this reorganization thing
 
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
between the puc and the department of
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
energy is probably going to have another
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
round next year when we have some more
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
time in and see actually what works and
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
what doesn't work because you know as of
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
right now a lot of these positions have
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
only been filled for a couple of months
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
so we're still having a lot of uh
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
which way should we go so what my point
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
is we're not trying to solve every issue
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
that we possibly can address in the
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee otherwise we would be here
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
for the next six weeks which i don't
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
know about you but i don't want to do uh
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
so anyways i was going to start
 
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
by we i have
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
and make sure we don't have something
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
else i have three sets of uh proposed
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
comments one came from
 
00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.190 align:start position:0%
comments one came from
uh

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
one came from the department and the
 
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.150 align:start position:0%
one came from the department and the
commission

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to start with them uh they
 
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
have a couple of issues that they still
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
apparently disagree on but they were
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
supposedly working on and since i was
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
sailing around the caribbean and mostly
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
underwater whenever i could be
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the last week
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't really have a chance to follow
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
up on them so i guess we'll leave it to
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
david and griffin if you guys want to
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
come up and tell us where we're at with
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh let me just say i hopefully i believe
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
everyone on the subcommittee should have
 
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
got a copy of their comments
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
which uh starts out okay here's a little
 
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
bit more now okay well we'll go with
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
they did tell me cat that they were
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to be working on trying to come up
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
with more over the last week but like i
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
said i was kind of out of sell range of
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
email range so this appears to be the
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
latest so we'll let them address that
 
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
latest so we'll let them address that
gentlemen

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
gentlemen
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead and just remember to turn on
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
your mics
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
harrington for the record griffin
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
roberge from the department of energy
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
david shulock from the department of
 
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.350 align:start position:0%
david shulock from the department of
energy

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
so we just passed out a new list this is
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
the same list that you saw last month
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
with some changes
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
disagreements if you want to call it
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
that between the
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
it was a discussion really between the
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
puc and the department
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
had to do with community power
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
aggregation and which agency
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
uh should uh have the authority over
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
that under rsa 53e excuse me could you
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
reference which number uh this is
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
number four which is stricken on on this
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh on the new list
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
cliff below made a comment about that
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
thinking that they thought that perhaps
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
the puc was the appropriate body
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
the department and the puc discussed
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
that and the department has decided to
 
00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.870 align:start position:0%
that and the department has decided to
withdraw

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
so that you know all of that authority
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
would remain with the public utilities
 
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
would remain with the public utilities
commission

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
let's uh let's make this as informal as
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
possible because it is a work session so
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
sure david could you do that please
 
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.909 align:start position:0%
sure david could you do that please
um

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know we can do this one of two ways
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
we can go through the bill the amendment
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
itself or we can go through the
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
department's list your
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
preference what do uh subcommittee
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
members prefer
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
would you prefer just to go through the
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
list as it's written okay then that
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
we can look at the bill afterwards if
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
jackie please use your microphone
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
i'm having a very hard time hearing him
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the microphone isn't
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
closer that he said and i thought it i
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
heard him say that he the department was
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
going to withdraw
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
all their requests to um
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
it was just online item four or the
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
newest thing that they passed out there
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
was the question of community
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
so it's going to stay with the puc
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
is what they're saying that was that
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to stay that but you had
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
requested that it be gone from the pc
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
and now you've
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
acceded that it should be in a piece
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's all i wanted a clarification
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
huh yeah so david maybe you can just
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
start from the top of the list and go
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
through with that please uh so the first
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
one is a uh request to amend uh the
 
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.590 align:start position:0%
one is a uh request to amend uh the
state's

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
state's
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
crossing license statute
 
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.190 align:start position:0%
crossing license statute
so

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know there there's a provision in
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
the statute that allows public utilities
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
to commence eminent domain proceedings
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
so that they can cross people's private
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
lands right and then there's a section
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
of that statute for the crossing of
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
public lands and public waters because
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
public utilities and regular companies
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
that want to run utility type lines
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
can't conduct eminent domain upon the
 
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
can't conduct eminent domain upon the
state

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
right okay so there's a provision in
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that statute
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
that allowed the puc
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
to grant
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
licenses to public utilities and
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
individuals running public utility type
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
lines or pipes across state land to give
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 divided that authority
 
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.470 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 divided that authority
between

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
and the puc
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
but that division was clunky
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
in in in the way that it worked right
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
clunky in the sense that
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know both the
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
department and then the public utilities
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
commission had to open adjudicative
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
proceedings to do that
 
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:08.710 align:start position:0%
proceedings to do that
right

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
um what we would be requesting is that
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
the department be permitted to grant
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
those licenses
 
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.710 align:start position:0%
those licenses
for

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
for utilities to cross state lands and
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
state waters to have that just be
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
an administrative process
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
at the department
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
unless some
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
some person who's affected by that
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
crossing feels harmed
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
and wants to appeal it to the puc
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's a big reversal
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.230 align:start position:0%
isn't it
so

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that would be a
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory process so the regulatory
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
process is now being moved over to
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
what we were
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
discussing during hb2 discussions as a
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
bright red line right we're taking
 
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
bright red line right we're taking
regulatory

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
processes for
 
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.710 align:start position:0%
processes for
facilities

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
energy facilities being cited over
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
public lands and giving it to
 
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
public lands and giving it to
uh

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
an agency rather than
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
regulators right that's a big change
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
there the the authority um has existed
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
at the public utilities commission to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
grant those licenses for a very long
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
time yep right so house
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
divided that authority that was a big
 
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
divided that authority that was a big
change

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
when they created the department and
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
divided the authority to grant those
 
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.269 align:start position:0%
divided the authority to grant those
licenses

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
and the way that it was divided was that
 
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:37.750 align:start position:0%
and the way that it was divided was that
the

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
department was permitted to grant a
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
license when all of the parties agreed
 
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
license when all of the parties agreed
right

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.870 align:start position:0%
right
but

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
we we have to establish an adjudicative
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
process to find out even who the parties
 
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.069 align:start position:0%
process to find out even who the parties
are

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.190 align:start position:0%
are
right

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
and that's a very clunky process so what
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're proposing
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
review the license application
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
grant it or deny it
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
give give everybody notice
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
of that and then people who want to
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
actually adjudicate whether they've
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
suffered a monetary damage as a result
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
of that crossing or they think there's
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
some some aesthetic problem with the
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
crossing that they can take then take
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that over to the puc and adjudicate it
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
i've had a lot of experience with these
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
crossings um
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
very very few of them
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
are controversial
 
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.389 align:start position:0%
are controversial
or

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're very few are controversial right
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
they're granted all the time by the
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission with nobody
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
from the public ever wanting to to
 
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.269 align:start position:0%
from the public ever wanting to to
participate

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative votes
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
mr shulock would it not be true that
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
making this change would speed up this
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
entire process but not making it would
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
slower and more cumbersome
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct this is an efficiency
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
measure thank you
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
peter i believe you had a question thank
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
you mr shulock
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
since you're saying that
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
the original proposal was too clunky
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be the simplest thing just
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
to leave it with the puc that's probably
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
the least clunky of all
 
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.389 align:start position:0%
the least clunky of all
uh

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
basically because the puc doesn't have
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
the staff to
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the task and that is a
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
result of the reorganization so that is
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
not a great excuse but that's that's
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
where we're at one thing i want my
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
people understand on this so just
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
there's no confusion because it is an
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
important piece this is not talking
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
about private land crossings okay that's
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
eminent domain and it's very strict
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
rules on that a lot of people have said
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of things about it with some
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
transmission projects how we say unnamed
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
that would never have made that uh never
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
have crossed that
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh bar because it was too high it has to
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
be that's very difficult when you're
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
talking private this is on public lands
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
like a bridge going across a river where
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
i when the last one i think i was
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
involved was a gas pipeline down in
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
newington and nobody really cared the
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
gas pipeline was there but they were
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
moving it because they put up a new
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
bridge and the whole process went
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
through and it just becomes more
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
cumbersome because you have to have an
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process where there was no
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
one adjudicating against it but you had
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
to go through all you had to almost
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
pretend there was somebody there that
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't and it just would make it a lot
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
simpler but that does leave the option
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
if somebody does really have a concern
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
over again only public only talking
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
about public crossings here so if they
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
say well i don't want to have to look at
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
that gas pipeline
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
then they can appeal to the puc and
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
bring in lawyers and have the full
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
hearing and the whole bit can i get the
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
definition of public lands
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
does that include conservation lands and
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
open space and what is included in that
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
it includes lands owned by the state of
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire just the state right um we
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
do although the
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
puc and the doe do not regulate
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
crossings over
 
00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
crossings over
highways

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
highways
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation deals
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to say two words great
 
00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.110 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to say two words great
um

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.910 align:start position:0%
um
how

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
when you make this decision or grant
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
this license
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
do you bring in the very same people
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
that the puc would have brought in in
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
other words will you have hearings on it
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
will you have
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
uh department you know environmental
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
services and any other departments that
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
need to be brought in or is this a
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
totally internal process
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
so the the process at the department
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
would be internal
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
people who were affected by it
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
right who who might want to
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
litigate against it
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
would litigate at the puc
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
on the basis of a license that was
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
issued or denied
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
so after the fact
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
before anything was constructed right
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
but after the license work was granted
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
with and under the proposal the puc
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
could order the department to withdraw
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
the license modify the license or if the
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
department denied a license order the
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
department to grant the license
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
but but it doesn't
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
exempt anybody from other
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
permits that they may have by law on
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's des or anybody else they'd
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
still have exactly correct and the case
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
i was talking about jackie was actually
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
the pipeline going across great bay well
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
now we have transmission lines but i i
 
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.030 align:start position:0%
now we have transmission lines but i i
i

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
i
is

00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
if somebody came in and
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to construct
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
something across a public order way
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
how does the public know that that even
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
might happen do you notify will the
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
department of exchange
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
notify that we're kind of
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
going this is an area that hasn't
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
changed they're still going to this the
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
notifications and all that stuff is
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to stick with the law if we get
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
into that level of detail on every
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
single thing we're going to be here
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to be here for a long time
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
to find out
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
what the change for the next 25 years is
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
going to be but that hasn't changed
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're still going to do the public
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
notification requirements that exist
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
that existed 10 years ago that existed
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
10 days ago that will exist
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
10 years from now so no one's talking
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
about changing that right so under under
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
the proposal that we would give you
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
permit was granted or denied the
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
department would publish notice on its
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
website and then has the ability to
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
direct the public utility to publish
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
that notice in a newspaper or on its
 
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
that notice in a newspaper or on its
website

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
and then if it's actually appealed
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
then there's another requirement that
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
give its regular notice
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
of that appeal proceeding so that if
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
other people want to come in and
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
litigate against or for the crossing
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
they can do that
 
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.390 align:start position:0%
they can do that
so

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
i understand that the poc is now
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
understaffed to be able to do this but
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
seems to me if people can appeal to the
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
puc and that organization doesn't have
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
the staff
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
that will become a very uh tough thing
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
to do or it will be a drawn out thing to
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
do you must just get rid of the appeal
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
to the puc entirely
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
because if you're trying to speed up the
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
process in the appeal let me could i
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
address that david please because what's
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
going to happen there is you're
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
basically going to have the department
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
of energy shaking we think this permit
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
should be granted and they're going to
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
have staff and present a case to the puc
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have somebody else
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
who's saying we don't agree so the puc
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
is not going to be an investigative body
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to be an adjudicative body
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
much like a judge in a court case
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to sit there and listen to
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
both sides and decide what is right they
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't need their own research and to
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
quite then i see clifton over there
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
nodding his head because i can remember
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
being told a bunch of times as a puc
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner knock it off because i
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
would do my own research and they say
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
you can only pay attention to what's
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
presented at the hearing that's the
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
facts that's what you have to base your
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
decision on so that's not really an
 
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
decision on so that's not really an
issue

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.190 align:start position:0%
issue
okay

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
and we we have heard from
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
utilities at least that some of the
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
processes were cumbersome
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
for them
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
he said it's informal you can just go
 
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
he said it's informal you can just go
okay

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
back back when we were discussing
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
these bills sb91 and three foot
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
we were told that this was going to be a
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
cost saver because they were they're
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate redundant staff and
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
where it was needed the staff would be
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
made available to whichever group needed
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
it you know like they were going to
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
share the you know
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
human resources and share the legal
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
staff and share these diff is that like
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
no longer on the table now there's a
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
wall and the
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
doe staff cannot be made available to
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
the puc as needed
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's a very
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
packed question
 
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.270 align:start position:0%
packed question
so

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in the statute
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
which we're asking you to change
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
right that
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
prohibited any employee from the
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
department speaking with any employee at
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
or vice versa
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
regarding any matter pending before the
 
00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:44.630 align:start position:0%
regarding any matter pending before the
other

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.909 align:start position:0%
other
right

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that has
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
really put up a wall
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.190 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
cooperation

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
among the two agencies to achieve the
 
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.549 align:start position:0%
among the two agencies to achieve the
efficiencies

00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
that i think the bill was designed to
 
00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.590 align:start position:0%
that i think the bill was designed to
achieve

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we have some language
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
that will hopefully resolve that
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
then in addition to that the two
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
agencies are working together sort of
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
on memorandum of understanding of how to
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
without talking to each other
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
well there's no matter pending on that
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
talking about how to cooperate with one
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
another generally
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
maybe i need to move
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
for example we had the energy storage
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
docket where there was a report and it
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
was being written we were all all the
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
way to you know ground zero and it was
 
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.029 align:start position:0%
way to you know ground zero and it was
yo

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
yo
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
it was about to be issued and that's
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
that was like august of last year right
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
what you can't talk to each other
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
because it's a pending matter
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
well we we can't talk to each other
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes on that docket we talk
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
to each other on the record
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
and and our meetings going on on the
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
record if you don't
 
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.590 align:start position:0%
record if you don't
know

00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
that those meetings would involve all
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
the parties if they were occurring
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm i'm a part of it if
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
you'd like to know so here for a second
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
what they have is they call technical
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
sessions and they'll have the various
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
all the different interveners and people
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i have participated in every single
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
one of them i know
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
and they'll they'll they can sit down
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
and talk but they are on the record yeah
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
there's the you have the whole ex party
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing that you have to be careful of
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
especially with the commissioners
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not allowed to have
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
private conversations even though again
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
clifton's nodding his head over there
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't know how many phone
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
calls we got from a particular um
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
executive council member uh
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
and that we just couldn't talk to him so
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
i mean that's that's the way it is so
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
the technical sessions do allow them to
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
talk to each other because everybody's
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
there and it's public so if if we were
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
having substantive discussions about one
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
of the dockets
 
00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
all of the parties would get notice
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i would be able to participate or
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
you might find it you might see it in a
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
letter filed in the docket
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
so that you know that that conversation
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
occurred and that or was occurring and
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
you could respond to it
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
so if you're not saying it it's not
 
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.789 align:start position:0%
so if you're not saying it it's not
happening

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
can we move on to uh item two here
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay um so
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
on number two okay a number of years ago
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
house bill i think it was 1104
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
was passed to shorten the amount of time
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
that agencies had
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
to respond to applications and requests
 
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
to respond to applications and requests
right

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
um at that time a number of agencies
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
came in and asked the
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
uh legislature for exemptions to those
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
timelines they were essentially cut in
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
half right
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
half right
back

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
when 1104 went through
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
number of agencies came in and asked for
 
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
number of agencies came in and asked for
exceptions

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
um des got a
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
great number of those
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
got exemptions for
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
practically well i won't even say
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
practically for everything that the
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission did
 
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.549 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission did
and

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
i think the reason for that is because
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
there's virtually nothing that occurs
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
at the public utilities commission that
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
does not involve
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
an uninformed
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
rate payer
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
who's having a problem
 
00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:27.909 align:start position:0%
who's having a problem
right

00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
many of the things that the public
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
utilities commission does
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time it takes some hand
 
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.549 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time it takes some hand
holding

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
holding
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
some helping the ratepayer communicate
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
with their public utility and vice versa
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that matters are resolved
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
doing that in the short amount of time
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
is often not
 
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.190 align:start position:0%
is often not
possible

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
then in addition you know you have
 
00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:02.070 align:start position:0%
then in addition you know you have
normal

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.190 align:start position:0%
normal
people

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
putting solar panels on their homes and
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
they have to negotiate some very
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
complicated rules
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
when they do that
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
and have to file applications about
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
they're not expert in right and
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
very often
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh the information that they provide is
 
00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:25.830 align:start position:0%
uh the information that they provide is
wrong

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
and has to be traced through and has to
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
be corrected
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
those things also
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
are difficult to do within the short
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time provided by the statute
 
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.110 align:start position:0%
amount of time provided by the statute
then

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
a number of the requests that would go
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
to the commission really aren't suitable
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
for automatic grant
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
right and that that is the hammer uh in
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
541a if you don't meet the timeline then
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
the request is automatically granted
 
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.630 align:start position:0%
the request is automatically granted
right

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh the request might be something like
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
would you please
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
require my utility to give me a payment
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
plan i can afford
 
00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
plan i can afford
well

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
what does it mean if that's
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
automatically granted
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
right well you you just don't know right
 
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.909 align:start position:0%
right well you you just don't know right
um

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
then there are a number of
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
things that would go before the
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
commission that are are delicate such as
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
terminations of service
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and especially when those terminations
 
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
and especially when those terminations
occur

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
when somebody has a medical condition
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
and they require the utility service
 
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
so that they don't die or have some
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
serious event
 
00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.149 align:start position:0%
serious event
um

00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
when when their utilities are are cut
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
off right
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
um and those are also very time
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
consuming involve a lot of investigation
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that the utility has gone
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
out and given all the proper notices and
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
banged on the door and tried to get
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
somebody in person etc david if i can
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
just interrupt for a second so what
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're basically doing is saying the same
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
rule that would apply to the puc is now
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
going to apply to doe correct that's
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
okay the reason for that is like he
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
stated is um i remember there was two
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
cases i'll mention there was one in that
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
house in bedford that went on for a year
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
and a half maybe longer this guy had all
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
sorts of mystery stuff going on in his
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
house and he was blaming the utility for
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
it and there was another one in bed in
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
the north country and it took us a long
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
time to get this power turned off when
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
they actually turned it off they found
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
he had like 150 pinball machines that
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
were on all the time and that's why his
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill was so high yeah but i mean these
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
things just they don't allow themselves
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
to be adjudicated really fast sometimes
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
and this just all it does is transfer
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
the authority that the puc has now to
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
the commission which will be
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
implementing that there's no change in
 
00:27:50.399 --> 00:27:57.669 align:start position:0%
implementing that there's no change in
that

00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i you know i hear i love i love
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
that story but i also remember the story
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
about the woman who froze to death in
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
her home because her utilities have been
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
shut off and that that's obviously
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
something that none of us want to have
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
happen again and that was what we tried
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
to avoid and that hit me deeply so if
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
i give you the date
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.549 align:start position:0%
don't understand
if

00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
the doe makes a decision oh we're
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
cutting that off
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
where does a customer go
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
if there's a timeline
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
to appeal that
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
do they go to the puc to appeal that
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
decision or they go to you to appeal
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
that decision or they go to the supreme
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
court i mean i i i
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's the thing i don't understand
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
i think under the statutes they would
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
first come back to us
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
back to you um and then they would
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
i've asked the attorney general's office
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
to look into this i haven't gotten an
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
answer yet but i think it's the supreme
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
court after that
 
00:29:03.679 --> 00:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
court after that
so

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
so if i clarify in my head
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
the puc will have nothing to do
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
as far as adjudicating
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
that position
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
whether it you know your decision it
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
would then go straight to attorney
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
general perhaps
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
subject to check i believe that's true
 
00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:22.630 align:start position:0%
subject to check i believe that's true
okay

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
supreme court you mean not the attorney
 
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.269 align:start position:0%
supreme court you mean not the attorney
general

00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would be the appellate uh
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction right and and most people
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
who can't pay a bill can't afford to go
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court right
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
isn't that really complicated that
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
something as trivial as cutting off
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
power i mean not trivial in the sense
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
that it could do harm but as trivial as
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
a process
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that people have to go to the supreme
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
court for this
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
i think they did anyhow
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
i know but it's the same now peter it's
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
write well two years ago if you went to
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
the puc and they said okay after months
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
and months and months of stuff yes the
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
utility you can cut off their power but
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
there's also restrictions on the time of
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
year you can do it and if there's a
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
medical issue involved and so forth uh
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
so they say yeah finally you can shut it
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
off in july first
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
that person would then have the option
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
of the appellate jurisdiction would
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
would be the supreme court as well so
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's no really change in that it's
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
just the difference between the body
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
making the initial decision is now going
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
to be the department of energy where
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
before it was the puc but the appellate
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh group was always in
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
continues to be the supreme court we
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't have any interim court in new
 
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.909 align:start position:0%
don't have any interim court in new
hampshire

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
so well that that makes sense but i
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
guess my my question would be
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
um what we're doing is we're saying that
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
for rsa 541 we're going to be exempting
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
the doe from timelines that used to
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
apply at the puc for these types of
 
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.070 align:start position:0%
apply at the puc for these types of
exemptions

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:48.870 align:start position:0%
exemptions
and

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'd like to understand is
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
why were these timelines in place in the
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
first place because we're you know we're
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're upending
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
something that may have been in place
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
for good reason i understand the idea of
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
trying to streamline but they probably
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
had some point well the the
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission was not on
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
the timeline
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
right and and
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
so we're not so you're trying to shore
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
up the doe to be consistent with how the
 
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.630 align:start position:0%
up the doe to be consistent with how the
puc

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
puc
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct we just
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
want the same treatment that the puck
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah just the doe does it instead of the
 
00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.509 align:start position:0%
yeah just the doe does it instead of the
puc

00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
puc
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that isn't what you're
 
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.870 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that isn't what you're
saying

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
there is another section on terminations
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
that is in
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
1258 okay right
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
um this deals with everything that
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
the puc did
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
that's now been transferred to the
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
department okay so where the puc
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
did not have a strict 60-day timeline
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
the department would not have a strict
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
60-day timeline we couldn't do it when
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
we were part of the puc we can't do it
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
now that we're separated from them it's
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
just that simple thank you that's great
 
00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:08.789 align:start position:0%
just that simple thank you that's great
yeah

00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
clarifies it we move on to three then
 
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.149 align:start position:0%
clarifies it we move on to three then
david

00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
david
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
three has to do uh with competitive
 
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.430 align:start position:0%
three has to do uh with competitive
suppliers

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
um there are consumer protection
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh provisions in the statute
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
and in rural
 
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
and in rural
uh

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to competitive electric and
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
gas supply
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
those consumer
 
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
those consumer
protection

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
functions were transferred to the
 
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.590 align:start position:0%
functions were transferred to the
department

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
department
but

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
there's a stray reference to the
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
commission uh in that statute
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
so we just want to correct your typo
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
correct a typo okay hopefully we can
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
go right through that one okay
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
and move on to since we've already
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
discussed four above we go to
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
so number five has to do with sections
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
in uh house bill 1258
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
and uh in particular this has to do
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
with that bright red line that
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
has gotten in the way of uh cooperation
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh among the
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
two departments and the problem with
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
that bright red line was that it was
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
kind of fuzzy
 
00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.470 align:start position:0%
kind of fuzzy
right

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
and um much wider a line than is really
 
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.549 align:start position:0%
and um much wider a line than is really
necessary

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
um and it
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's just caused all sorts of um
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh problems
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
so uh we would propose uh eliminating
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
the language that's currently in the
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
statute and replacing
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
that bright red line with the statement
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
that in adjudicative proceedings
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
the public utilities and
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
commission and the department are
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
subject to a special provision in rsa
 
00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.830 align:start position:0%
subject to a special provision in rsa
541a

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
541a
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the ex parte communication
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
provision so
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
if we were actually
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
in a litigated um
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
contested case docket
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
either at the department or at the
 
00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:17.030 align:start position:0%
either at the department or at the
commission

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
the deciders couldn't talk to each other
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
right so or um
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
unless it were on the record
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
and in front of all the other parties so
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
no secret behind the behind the curtain
 
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.669 align:start position:0%
no secret behind the behind the curtain
communications

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
communications
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
in just those
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
litigated dockets
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
any other kind of matter we could
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
communicate with one another like any
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
other agency can communicate with any
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
other agency
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
and this so people understand this fixes
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
what i've always perceived as kind of a
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
wrong to say that it's because over the
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
years the commissioners would sit down
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
and talk to staff and go over all these
 
00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:56.230 align:start position:0%
and talk to staff and go over all these
details

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
details
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't and those weren't
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
considered ex-part-time conversations
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
but they couldn't sit down and talk to
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the litigant who was appealing
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
the with the utility or a private
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
citizen because that would be
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
ex-part-time so this sets it down so if
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
you're actually going to have uh
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
official conversations in a judicial
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
process then they'd be done in what i
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier as a technical
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
session where all the parties would be
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
notified all the parties would be there
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
and everyone would know what was going
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
on so this is an improvement from the
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
what we had existing right and then
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
understand that the way things are set
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
up now the commission has its own staff
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
it has six senior advisors there might
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
be a financial analyst the commissioners
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
can still talk to those people they just
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
can't talk to people at the department
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
because we're a party in the in the case
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what this this bright red
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
line says the the brighter red line uh
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
in adjudicative dockets
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
contested case dockets
 
00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.150 align:start position:0%
contested case dockets
okay

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.470 align:start position:0%
house bill
2

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
set up a system where the
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
the puc and the department could
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
continue to enforce
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
the provisions of existing puc rules
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
as they apply to each agency
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
right and the reason for allowing us to
 
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
right and the reason for allowing us to
continue

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
continue
to

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
operate under that same old set of rules
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
quite a period of time
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
was one it
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's an awful lot of work to create new
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
sets of rules
 
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.790 align:start position:0%
sets of rules
right

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.390 align:start position:0%
and
two

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
i think the drafters wanted to make sure
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
that nothing fell between the cracks
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
while we were doing that so all of those
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
regulations still exist
 
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.589 align:start position:0%
regulations still exist
right

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
was that there was another provision in
 
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
was that there was another provision in
rsa541a

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
rsa541a
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
that dealt specifically with
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
organizational rules and
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
procedural rules
 
00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
procedural rules
and

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
that provision in 541a says that when
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's a statute that's passed
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
that makes your
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
not accurate anymore
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
those expire in just one year
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
right so those the pucs uh procedural
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
rules and organizational rules which the
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
department is still cribbing off of
 
00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:40.630 align:start position:0%
department is still cribbing off of
um

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
will expire on june 30th
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
unless something is done
 
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.990 align:start position:0%
unless something is done
and

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
that i think would cause
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
people's heads to explode
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
if in the midst of all this change and
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
all this uncertainty everybody suddenly
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
had to learn another set of procedural
 
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
had to learn another set of procedural
rules

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
right so what we're asking is is for
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh an exemption
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
from that provision in 541a so that the
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh commission's procedural rules will
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
remain in effect and we can continue to
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
use them until we i believe
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you maybe that's it maybe
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
oh okay now it works
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay so that's a good reminder turn your
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
mic off if you're not speaking that'd be
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
great okay so my question is this then
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to this change
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
i've spent a lot of time looking at rsa
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
541 over the years
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm familiar with the fact that it
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
takes close to a year
 
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.790 align:start position:0%
takes close to a year
to

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
write and get approval for new year new
 
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
write and get approval for new year new
rules

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
so from the start of the process until
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
the rules go into effect is usually a
 
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.349 align:start position:0%
the rules go into effect is usually a
year

00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
year
minimum

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
and it can be longer
 
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.150 align:start position:0%
and it can be longer
so

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
if this provision wasn't adopted and
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
those rules that you referred to expire
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
on june 30th
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
what rules would be enough would apply
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
there's a a set of uh procedural rules
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
that were prepared by the department of
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
justice that are sort of like a default
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
set of procedural rules they would just
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
be very different
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
right and they they wouldn't really be
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
tailored to what the puc does
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
which would just cause more confusion
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up would be this change
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be pretty essential then to
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
allowing the
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
department to move forward with its
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
to use the rules that are in place
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
and of course we're not going to let you
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
off the hook we will eventually put in
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
new rules yes don't have to do it by
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
june 30th right okay okay can we move on
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
to seven please can i i'm sorry peter go
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
ahead um
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're asking for an exemption but how
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
long does that exemption last all right
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
is this an exemption for a year forever
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
or what what when does the exemption
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.349 align:start position:0%
i think um
under

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
the the law it would
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
it would last
 
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.710 align:start position:0%
it would last
forever

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
right until we adopt new rules right and
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
that process is underway i'm the person
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
tasked with drafting the depart
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
the department's new procedural rules
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it is a bear
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
but we're hoping to have that done this
 
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.470 align:start position:0%
but we're hoping to have that done this
year

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll have jackie be the vice
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
president in charge of making sure they
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
get the new rules out in a timely manner
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
i know they're in a a rule-making
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
procedure but what i want to ask is how
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
is this rulemaking
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
going to affect
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
the pucs current rules
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding would be the department
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
of energy is making is in the
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
rule-making process
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
how will this affect
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
puc's rules
 
00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:22.390 align:start position:0%
puc's rules
well

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
under 541a if you if you do nothing
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
but that that's what 541a does it would
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
cause the public utilities procedural
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
rules to expire because they're no
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
longer accurate
 
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.510 align:start position:0%
longer accurate
right

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.470 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
if if you take the action that we're
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
asking you to do those rules will stay
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
and what you're presuming there then i
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
assume is that when the new rules for
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy come out
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be a corresponding set of rules
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
from the puc that says cancel the
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
following rules exactly yeah we're
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
working on the rule making statement
 
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.030 align:start position:0%
working on the rule making statement
yeah

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
all right couldn't we have an expiration
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
of five years i mean the notions are
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
going to go on forever is is yes five
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
david if you would five years i'm sure
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
that we but again we don't make sure it
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall through the cracks good
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
point lee thank you
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh seven has to do with the
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
assessment statute this is the way that
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh the commission
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
office of consumer advocate or funded is
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
through a assessment on public utilities
 
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.790 align:start position:0%
through a assessment on public utilities
and

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.790 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
the the job of assessing the utilities
 
00:42:55.599 --> 00:42:56.309 align:start position:0%
the the job of assessing the utilities
of

00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
figuring out what they uh
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
what they have to pay invoicing them
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
collecting the funds etc
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
um that is all done by the department
 
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.550 align:start position:0%
um that is all done by the department
now

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
but there are a number of stray
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
references in the statute we'll call
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
them typos
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
that need to be fixed and that's what
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
number seven
 
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.990 align:start position:0%
number seven
addresses

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.990 align:start position:0%
addresses
so

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is the one that really had me
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
bothered the doe is going to collect all
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
the funds and these would also be puc
 
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
the funds and these would also be puc
funds

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
and i asked you offline that there was a
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
mention of assessments to utilities
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
which we have i believe four in this
 
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.589 align:start position:0%
which we have i believe four in this
state

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
going up
 
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
going up
and

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps not even being
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
necessary or not being um
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say legal but i will say
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
legal anymore
 
00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.990 align:start position:0%
legal anymore
so

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
if you do all the assessing are you then
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
controlling the purse strings
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the puc
 
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.430 align:start position:0%
of the puc
which

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
i i just i i don't understand that and
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
yes we we do not control the purse
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
strings so the budget of the puc and of
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
the oca those are set during the budget
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
process by the legislature and the
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
governor right
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
we would just be collecting the money
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
and making sure it was in the kitty for
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
them to use
 
00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:27.190 align:start position:0%
them to use
so

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
so now
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
will two agencies be collecting
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
assessments instead of one
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
no it's just the department that will
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
collect the assessment and then
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
everybody shares in it
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
so one one
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
agency collects
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to belabor it but i will
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
attorney sheila can you explain to us
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
how the assessments arrived at like
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for that piece is it
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
based on the budgets of the
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh agencies involved or i'm not sure i
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
can speak to that fully right we
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
we probably arranged to have somebody
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
who deals with the budgets to come in
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
and do that
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
actually i
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
i can't even address it we'll have to
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
have somebody come in and do that for
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
you but what you're saying is number
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
seven is basically the
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
administration of the assessment piece
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be over in the doe yeah so
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
it and it already is these are just
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
typographical errors right it doesn't
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
change that how it's arrived at it just
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
as you said the money goes to and by the
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
way i was just reminded uh
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
fill out pin cards please before you
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
leave you don't have to do them this
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
second but before you leave please thank
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
you yeah okay and so we can go on just a
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
pink because they're speaking that's all
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
so fred can have the uh information here
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
correct spelling of david schulack's
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah all right there you go okay david
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's a section in
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258
 
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.829 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258
that

00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.839 --> 00:46:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
changes

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.829 align:start position:0%
changes
that

00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
i think corrects an oversight
 
00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
i think corrects an oversight
um

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:37.829 align:start position:0%
um
by

00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
giving responsibility for rsa 1263b
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
but there's one provision
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
the the drafters at ols just
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
substituted department for commission
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
wherever they saw it but there is one
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
provision in there that actually should
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
remain public utilities commission
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh because it you know
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
things have to be done in conformity
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
with tariffs that are approved by
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
right and it's only the commission that
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
approves tariffs that's
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of their powers not the
 
00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.109 align:start position:0%
that's one of their powers not the
departments

00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
also in the vein of
 
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:20.950 align:start position:0%
also in the vein of
just

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question about this uh
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
so this is just in a a correction to
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
hb 1258 as introduced correct the
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
there's no correction needed in the
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
statute that's correct just a correction
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
to the amendment itself yes exactly
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay uh number nine has to do with
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
complaints that are filed with the
 
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.150 align:start position:0%
complaints that are filed with the
department

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then referred
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission for
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
adjudication right
 
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.589 align:start position:0%
adjudication right
and

00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
1258 would insert
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
by

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
by a public utility so violations of
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
statute or ruled by a public utility
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
could be referred to the public
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
utilities commission for adjudication
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
the problem with that insertion
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
both the department and the public
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't just deal with public utilities
 
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.990 align:start position:0%
don't just deal with public utilities
anymore

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
so we deal with competitive suppliers
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
etc um
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
all of whom might be subject to some
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication at the public utilities
 
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.069 align:start position:0%
adjudication at the public utilities
commission

00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
so the statute is currently we think
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
correct and and that should come out of
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
so number
 
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.829 align:start position:0%
so number
10

00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
there are two sections in house bill
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
1258 that would require
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission to
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
approve something called affiliate
 
00:49:06.319 --> 00:49:07.990 align:start position:0%
approve something called affiliate
agreements

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
between public utilities and and their
 
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.349 align:start position:0%
between public utilities and and their
affiliates

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
affiliates
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and that's something that the public
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
utilities commission has never done in
 
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.950 align:start position:0%
utilities commission has never done in
advance

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
advance
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
they they might look at a specific
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
prudence question
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh down the line when some of those
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
expenses go into rates but
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
those are not agreements that the public
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
utilities commission actually approves
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
um and so we would ask that that
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
those phrases also come out of uh the
 
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.390 align:start position:0%
those phrases also come out of uh the
amendment

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
so this is fixing what was a historic
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
mistake because it was never done and if
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
indeed it was looked at it would be
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
looked at as a rate case if they tried
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
to bring in costs associated with
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
number 11
 
00:49:53.839 --> 00:49:56.230 align:start position:0%
number 11
oh

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
yes and in those two sections
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
it would be the bolded language that
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
says notwithstanding the requirements of
 
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh griffin points out to me that that
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
would just mean removing sections 11 and
 
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.309 align:start position:0%
would just mean removing sections 11 and
12

00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
12
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
number 11 was
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
one of the matters of discussion between
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:29.430 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
and

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.430 align:start position:0%
the department
and

00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
section in
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1258 that would
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
state that in the
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
statute governing attachments to polls
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
that the public utilities commission
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
would retain
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
its authority over safety
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
and a number of other things
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
and the two agencies looked at that and
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
we think that the appropriate thing to
 
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.069 align:start position:0%
we think that the appropriate thing to
do

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
would be to say
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
that both the department and the
 
00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:08.549 align:start position:0%
that both the department and the
commission

00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
retain their authority over safety
 
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
retain their authority over safety
etc

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
um rather than specifying one or the
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
other right
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
and um there's a good reason for that i
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
mean the the
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
provision that this addresses is not a
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
provision that grants authority or takes
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
authority away
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's a provision that makes clear
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
that when utilities enter into
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
agreements with people who want to
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
attach to their polls
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
they can't bargain away the state's
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's i think what that provision goes
 
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
that's i think what that provision goes
to

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
and both the
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh department and the
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission have some
 
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.190 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission have some
authority

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
over safety etcetera of those facilities
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
can you say in in i know we don't have a
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
department of energy or we didn't
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
in prior statutes recently
 
00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:10.150 align:start position:0%
in prior statutes recently
but

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
specify what safety regulations the
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy would have
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
oversight for because it seems like that
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
would be regulatory no
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
well we do have regulatory authority
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
over the utilities we we have
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
full plenary jurisdiction over them and
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
their operations
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
right the real question is how does and
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
and so does the puc
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the real question is how does that
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
get divided up
 
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.230 align:start position:0%
get divided up
right

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.990 align:start position:0%
right
and

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's a much larger
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
more philosophical question
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
than this provision addresses
 
00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:48.549 align:start position:0%
than this provision addresses
um

00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
we might set the regulations generally
 
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.710 align:start position:0%
we might set the regulations generally
um

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
whereas the
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission adjudicates
 
00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission adjudicates
them

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
and enforcement
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that through adjudication or i'm just
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out again because it's
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a roles and responsibilities thing
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
well it's it's some of both
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
right so the department has finding
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
authority for some things right yeah in
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
some instances we have to go to the
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
commission to uh have that fine imposed
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
in some instances we can impose that
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
fine ourselves it it depends on which
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
which section of the
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
the statutes you're looking at
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
but it's it's quite a matrix and
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it yeah
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
good question um as far as when you're
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
talking about uh to regulate safety so
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
would the uh initial jurisdiction be
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
with the doe and then if there was a
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
dispute between
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's be the utility that owned
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
the pole or the
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
company that was wanted to string
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
fiber optics on it or whatever
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
and then that would go to the pu to pucs
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the judicial process or they both
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
have initial jurisdiction because to me
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's kind of confusing one could say
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's okay and one could say it's not
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
right we have to work that out
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the department is going to
 
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
the the department is going to
have

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
say the pipeline safety rules
 
00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:32.950 align:start position:0%
say the pipeline safety rules
right

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
department will be the one to say that
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
electrical crossings have to comply with
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
the national electrical safety code
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
and and which version
 
00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.430 align:start position:0%
and and which version
right

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
the puc will have to interpret along
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
i i just don't think that it's it's that
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
specific yet
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and i don't want to be more specific
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
than that so that nothing falls through
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
the cracks
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
until we
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
make the fine division
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
okay because this is something that we i
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
think we're going to address because i
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
mean i'm looking back at donner over
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
here as a utility representative you
 
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.109 align:start position:0%
here as a utility representative you
have

00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
who do you go to when you go to the
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
department and you go to the puc and
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
what if they don't agree i mean the the
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
safety personnel the engineers have been
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
transferred to doe but there's still
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
some knowledgeable people at the puc who
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
could say no no we don't agree that's
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
not safe enough i mean could be on you
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
know we got into things like welder
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
qualifications on pipelines i remember
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
when randy was there so if there's a
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the two
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
it seems like you're kind of putting
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
everybody in a what do you do next well
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to clarify a lot of that as
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
we go through this sort of joint
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
project on rulemaking
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
which we're doing in conjunction with
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
the department of justice
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
to help us clarify where those dividing
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
lines will be
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay just it seems like
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
most of what we've had here is you've
 
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.630 align:start position:0%
most of what we've had here is you've
said

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
go to the doe it appeals to the puc or
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
go to the doe you appeal to the supreme
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
court this says you can go to both
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
and that to me brings up confusion as
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
far as okay i think i get a better deal
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
from the puc i'm going to go
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
say ask them if it's safe or no i think
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
i get a bit better deal from doe i'll
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
ask them if it's safe so i think that's
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
an issue that we need to clean up a
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
little bit okay
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
jackie you had a question
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i guess
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
maybe my brain is not handling it as
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
well that we can't talk to each other if
 
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
well that we can't talk to each other if
there's

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
and if there's
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
conflicting opinions
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the two divisions can't really
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
discuss with each other why
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
unless it's in public
 
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.349 align:start position:0%
unless it's in public
and

00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to take
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
we just said throughout an arbitrary
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
number of five five years to work out i
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be unacceptable
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
because we see more and more
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
of what wants to be attached to polls
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
what's safe to attach to polls
 
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.750 align:start position:0%
what's safe to attach to polls
um

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
yeah you know all kinds of we have more
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
poll issues in here than we need to
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
but i i think that
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an issue
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
that can't wait for five years while
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
rulemaking or whatever is going on and
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
to say that both have jurisdiction
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
is very interesting because i think then
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature could stand up and say
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
no you guys work it out we'll decide who
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction is that a fair
 
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.549 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction is that a fair
assessment

00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature can always decide who
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it'll take five years
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
i mean we've we've begun the rule making
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
process and we expect to have it done
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
within 2022.
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we do expect to do that so so
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
then what was the extension about
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be done by this year
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
there'd be december 31st of this year i
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
would i'll go with 2022.
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
why do we need
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
an extension that could go on
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
that there was no time limit on so i i
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying and i understand
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
but the the
 
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
but the the
extension

00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
just for
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
procedural rules
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:32.789 align:start position:0%
and for
um

00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think organizational rules okay so the
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
procedural rules of the public utilities
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
commission would expire
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
on june 30th
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to have procedural
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
roles ready for june 30th
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
the other rules uh expire when they
 
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.030 align:start position:0%
the other rules uh expire when they
expire

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
expire
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
which for some of them is
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
eight years some is six some is five but
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
we fully expect to have the the
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
two new sets of rules ready well before
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
then but the ones you're referring to
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
with the whether it's six or eight those
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
are statutory requirements that the
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
rules expire after so many years
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of any reorganization exactly
 
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.549 align:start position:0%
regardless of any reorganization exactly
okay

00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
well this is maybe something that
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to think about a little
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
bit the the subcommittee obviously but
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's one of those things that we
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
want to see how it works and we come
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
back here if we're here next next term
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
and say all right let's pick one or the
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
other because it's not working or maybe
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
the rules work fine i'm just i'll just
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr shulock for taking this
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
question since we're on the subject of
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
rules that are
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
are being rewritten or being
 
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.630 align:start position:0%
are being rewritten or being
transferred

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't rsa 541 specify that rules need
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be re-evaluated every 10 years
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
and will that
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
provision of statute be followed as you
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
do this new rule making procedure
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
yes that provision is followed so
 
01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:07.510 align:start position:0%
yes that provision is followed so
house

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
said that
the

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
department can enforce those provisions
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the existing puc rules that fall
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
under its
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction now until those puc rules
 
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.190 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction now until those puc rules
expire

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
expire
 
01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
and that's the 10-year reevaluation
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's when they expire at the
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
10-year mark
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
right and some of those are at eight
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
years somewhere at
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
four years somewhere at two years
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
right so the puc is going to have to
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate but we're going through the
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
process now so that's all all of those
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
rules will be reevaluated within their
 
01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
rules will be reevaluated within their
10-year

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh period
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah all right can we move on
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
to your last point there then twelve
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that we may have to revisit this
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit okay you're all familiar
 
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
a little bit okay you're all familiar
with

01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.789 align:start position:0%
with
reggie

01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
reggie
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
right and
 
01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:03.109 align:start position:0%
right and
the

01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services and
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
the commission prepares a report
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
and delivers that to the legislature
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
regarding reggie
 
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.589 align:start position:0%
regarding reggie
and

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
the people who would prepare those
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
reports are now at the department
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
rather than at the commission
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
so we're just asking that you specify
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
that it's the department
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
of energy that would work with the
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services to
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
anyone have any further questions of
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going back to polls it seems to
 
01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.589 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going back to polls it seems to
me

01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:01:55.599 --> 01:01:56.470 align:start position:0%
me
that

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
you you have safety rules now that exist
 
01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:01.910 align:start position:0%
you you have safety rules now that exist
and

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
if you are going to
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
make any change to those then that would
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
probably should be a doe responsibility
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
but their implementation would be
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
working through the puc does that split
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
make sense or am i missing something
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
well with
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
with regard to the attachments
 
01:02:21.039 --> 01:02:21.829 align:start position:0%
with regard to the attachments
uh

01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
this the
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
the real
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
split i think would be the
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the department does everything
 
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.870 align:start position:0%
the department does everything
right

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
right
unless

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
unless
 
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
unless
the

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
poll owner and the person who wants to
 
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.029 align:start position:0%
poll owner and the person who wants to
attach

01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:37.039 align:start position:0%
attach
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreement because poll
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
attachments in the state are primarily
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
done through agreement
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
with the utility
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
by contract
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
and it's only when
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
they can't come to an agreement over
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
those terms that it would be adjudicated
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
what you know
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
you adjudicate what the terms would be
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
and what the costs would be right
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
um the public utilities commission would
 
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
do that under this framework
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
so follow up
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
then that would mean
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
as i hear what you're saying that the
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
doe should have primary safety
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the puc is the
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's as easy as that
 
01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.430 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's as easy as that
because

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
not everything that's done with regard
 
01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:28.839 align:start position:0%
to safety or storm response is done by
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
rule right some some of it is done in
 
01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:32.870 align:start position:0%
rule right some some of it is done in
adjudication

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
adjudication
 
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:33.910 align:start position:0%
adjudication
and

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're ready at this point
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
what can only be done by ruling what can
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
only be done by adjudication
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
we have to go through and we have to
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
so would it be safe to say that what
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
you're asking us is to say let's see how
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
it works and then maybe we come back in
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
the future and
 
01:03:56.319 --> 01:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
the future and
specify

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
specify
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit more criteria in the law i
 
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.109 align:start position:0%
a little bit more criteria in the law i
think

01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
for the what we've asked you to do here
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
i think that change can be made
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
immediately because it it
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect really who has the
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
safety authority the authority over
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
safety right that bigger question i
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
think we should wait and see how things
 
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.150 align:start position:0%
think we should wait and see how things
go

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i have a
 
01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:26.630 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i have a
question

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
yeah no
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
um go ahead yeah and you yeah i think
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
you were before me i was waiting so
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh is this the sum total of
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
the requests that you're making
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh i think there are a few things
 
01:04:38.799 --> 01:04:40.549 align:start position:0%
uh i think there are a few things
um

01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to address in the bill
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
itself or in the um
 
01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:46.870 align:start position:0%
itself or in the um
1258

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
1258
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
so and that's where i was going because
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know if you were prepared to
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the repeals that are
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
forced in at the end here i was
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned with item number
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
two but you can start wherever you want
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
in the bill and just know that i'd like
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
we need to know what we're
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
item number two
 
01:05:10.079 --> 01:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
item number two
um

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
relative to open access i believe uh
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
clifton bilo sitting behind me made a
 
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
clifton bilo sitting behind me made a
suggestion

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
that you repeal everything except for
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
sentence of that
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
and the department is okay with that
 
01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.710 align:start position:0%
and the department is okay with that
change

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:33.990 align:start position:0%
change
okay

01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
this is at the end under repeals item
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
20. it's uh page seven line four repeals
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
but item number two but this is to
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
repeal everything except the first
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
sentence of the rsa as it stands that's
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
his suggestion 374 f3 we don't have an
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that does that but that's my
 
01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:04.950 align:start position:0%
amendment that does that but that's my
suggestion

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
so we're all dealing with the same
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
document here this is the uh as
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
introduced version of the bill
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay and you're talking about
 
01:06:14.319 --> 01:06:15.670 align:start position:0%
yes okay and you're talking about
section

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
that starts on line 25 regulatory
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
support reference deleted
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
this is page 7 line 6
 
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:30.870 align:start position:0%
this is page 7 line 6
7

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
and it references the rsa
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
right okay 374
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
okay my notes are correct that's what
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
clifton wanted removed and you're
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
agreeing with that
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're agreeing to repeal of all
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
except for the first sentence in that
 
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.349 align:start position:0%
except for the first sentence in that
provision

01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay so so the first sentence creates
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
the requirement for open access right
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
the rest of the provision deals with
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
things that have already occurred
 
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.549 align:start position:0%
things that have already occurred
okay

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
but the first line is important so
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
just i just wanted acknowledgement
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
so will there be an amendment that will
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
include that first line of rsa 374 f3
 
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
include that first line of rsa 374 f3
four

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
yes i assume we're going to have
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
definitely going to have an amendment so
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh i
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
as well okay okay
 
01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.270 align:start position:0%
as well okay okay
but

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
if i may um
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
yes i think you'd want to pull it out of
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
the repeal section and it it's would you
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
say uh amend rsa 374 f3
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
roman 4. i promised representative plett
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
i would slow down
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
that restructuring policy principle
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
would just read its first line and it
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
would read roman four open access to
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution facilities
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory open access to the
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
electric system for wholesale and retail
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
transactions should be promoted period
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
and then there's three or four sentences
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
that follow that are basically archaic
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
that are really no longer applicable and
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
just by saying amen by
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
restating it
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
you get rid of that superfluous language
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
and and i appreciate the department
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
energy's consideration of that you know
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's just the
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:44.910 align:start position:0%
section two
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:46.309 align:start position:0%
section two
[Music]

01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
which is on the first page beginning
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh the bolded section
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
require the
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement division of the department
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
of energy to conduct audits when the
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission thought that
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
it ought to
 
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.950 align:start position:0%
it ought to
um

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.189 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
the department and the commission have
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
discussed this and it's my understanding
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
that the commission would like to
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
withdraw its request
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.149 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:26.159 --> 01:09:27.829 align:start position:0%
and
h2

01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
h2
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bolded language the bolded language
 
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
the bolded language the bolded language
so

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
section 2 would no longer be necessary
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
and the department and the commission
 
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.870 align:start position:0%
and the department and the commission
will

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
work out procedures
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
in an
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
mou just a question on that it would it
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that since the uh
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
commission is actually doing the
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
adjudicate process for rate setting
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
that you know part of what they're
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
looking at they may go into a docket for
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
a rate case
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
and look at something and say
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
this really doesn't make sense we need
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
more information we want an audit done
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
and why wouldn't they be have the
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
authority to say go audit doe because
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
you have the auditors why would they
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
what would they not want that authority
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
well i i
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
i think that would be an appropriate
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
request of of the commission
 
01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
request of of the commission
right

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
um but this is written broadly enough so
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
that we don't
nope

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
neither agency can specify what the
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
request would actually be
 
01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
request would actually be
right

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's a perfectly legitimate request
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know the the department
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
automatically audits uh the test year uh
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a rate case
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
um as a support for the staff preparing
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
the case so that the staff can identify
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
where the real issues are
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking the doe would do that
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
then right so the does it automatically
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
does that we're still doing all the
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
audits that we used to do explain the
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
test you think because a lot of people
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
might not know what you're referring to
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
just so it's clear okay we're not all
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
ex-puc commissioners like clinton
 
01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:09.590 align:start position:0%
ex-puc commissioners like clinton
so

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
utilities rates are forward-looking
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
right the the utility
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
is going to try and recover all of its
 
01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:20.630 align:start position:0%
is going to try and recover all of its
costs

01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
in in rates in the future but they're
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
set at a particular point in time
 
01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.910 align:start position:0%
set at a particular point in time
and

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
the first thing that occurs in that rate
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
setting process is to determine
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
what the utilities revenue requirement
 
01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:37.189 align:start position:0%
what the utilities revenue requirement
is

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
right how much money do they actually
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
need to uh conduct from from ratepayers
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
to conduct their business right
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
they do that based upon a historic
 
01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
they do that based upon a historic
year

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
right so they use the past
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
to look at the future and it's generally
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the year
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
the rate case being filed
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
right so if they file a rate case in
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
2022 they look at their expenses in 2021
 
01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
2022 they look at their expenses in 2021
right

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they provide the department with all
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
the information about those expenses in
 
01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
the information about those expenses in
2021

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the department goes in and audits
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
those expenses
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
to to make you know they
 
01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
they do things like
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
do samples and compare receipts
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that they match up right
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
they'll look at
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
expense lines and go back to previous
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
orders and see whether that was
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
something that was previously
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
denied for recovery
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
and if it was
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll note that to the
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
department staff and the department
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
staff will put that on the adjudicative
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
record for the commission
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
right but the the audit staff goes
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
through that test year
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
what the revenue requirement of the
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
utility is that's a starting point for
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
any rate case and the department will do
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
that automatically nobody needs to tell
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
the department to do that because that
 
01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:04.390 align:start position:0%
the department to do that because that
is

01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
the backup work for the department's
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicative staff
 
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
adjudicative staff
right

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead jackie so
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
if a rate is if a rate case then becomes
 
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.310 align:start position:0%
if a rate is if a rate case then becomes
controversial

01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy has done the audit
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
and said this is what it should be
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
the company says no this isn't what it
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
where does the responsibility lie
 
01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:38.470 align:start position:0%
where does the responsibility lie
to

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
either oversee that audit information
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
redo that information and hear that
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
case and
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding and a little not clear
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
who could um
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
talk to each other about that because it
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
now becomes
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
adversarial so you have information
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
you've provided
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
that information is not accepted
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
how do you discuss
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
how you got your information et cetera
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
et cetera if you are now an adversarial
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
party so as it was before
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
right except the staff was embedded at
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
if there is a disagreement over that
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement it gets litigated
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
and it gets litigated in front of the
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
commissioners they get a record prepare
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know presented to them and they they
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
litigate it that's all done in the
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
presence of all the parties
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's how it was before it won't change
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
so what basically i i think what i'm
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
hearing i don't want to put words in
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
your mouth but it sounds like the puc is
 
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:48.950 align:start position:0%
your mouth but it sounds like the puc is
saying

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.750 align:start position:0%
saying
this

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.870 align:start position:0%
this
uh

01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
section is not required because an audit
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
will be done whenever they need one
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
anyways that's correct and we're going
 
01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.470 align:start position:0%
anyways that's correct and we're going
to

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
agree to procedures when they actually
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
see one that they
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
they think should be done
 
01:15:04.159 --> 01:15:05.030 align:start position:0%
they think should be done
we're

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
working on a memorandum of understanding
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
other changes to the as the bill is
 
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:26.310 align:start position:0%
other changes to the as the bill is
amended

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
certainly go ahead
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
question paige
 
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:37.669 align:start position:0%
question paige
for

01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
the bolded language on 20 and 21
 
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh i thought we would just say that the
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
affiliate agreements were not approved
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
by the public utilities commission this
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
clearly says
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
oh we did yeah that's the request is to
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
remove the bold language that that would
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
be the amendment and it's
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for clearing my confusion yeah
 
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for clearing my confusion yeah
okay

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.550 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
so um there is one more thing i think
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we were here last on page 5 line 23
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.630 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
requested

01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the commission
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
also be able to advocate for new
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire interests before ferc
 
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
hampshire interests before ferc
and

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
the department and the puc are still in
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
discussions with that we've asked the
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
department of justice to join in on
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
those discussions
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
with my previous experience with newport
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the mass attorney general i'm aware of
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
working with several other states
 
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
working with several other states
and

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
that that's all over the lot but for
 
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.669 align:start position:0%
that that's all over the lot but for
instance

01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
vermont there's a department of public
 
01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:58.709 align:start position:0%
vermont there's a department of public
service

01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
in in a separate uh pu public attorney's
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
commission and
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
mostly the department of service carries
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
the load uh but but
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's both
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
and the connecticut is connecticut deep
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
and connecticut uh
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
forget the analogy there but deep does
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
most of it but they do both right and so
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it's an either or but
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
frankly you have the staff they don't
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
have much to have right and and we're
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find appropriate language that
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
for that so
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the department in consultation
 
01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:30.709 align:start position:0%
maybe the department in consultation
with

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
or after consultation with
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
something like that or
 
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.870 align:start position:0%
something like that or
anyhow

01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
anyhow
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
for right now i'm leaving that in the
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
hands of the department of justice to
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
help us figure out mass masses best deal
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
d-o-e-r doesn't get involved much but
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
the puc the dpu does so it depends
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
anything could work if you work it out
 
01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
anything could work if you work it out
yeah

01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
i would just say that the the issue
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
there is that you could have a judicial
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
proceedings that obviously ferc rules
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
effect on the puc so you'd want to make
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure that they were in communication
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
with doe
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
on dealing with ferc on on regional
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
issues because a lot of these filings
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
with ferc are done you know they've done
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
through iso new england as you know and
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
nepal so we just we need to make sure
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
that there's a good line of
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
communication there i don't see that
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
under the present uh
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
setup that the puc has the author of has
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
the staff to do that right but certainly
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
they're still participating i know for
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
example one commissioner right now is
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
down at the neirup meeting so um
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're still going to participate in
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
that but we've got to make sure that
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
there is that that
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
cross-communication because the things
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
could clearly affect uh ferc rules
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
clearly affect what goes on in the puc
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
and it's not just regional only it does
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
have an impact on how rates are set and
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
so forth i think the major concern here
 
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
so forth i think the major concern here
is

01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.950 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
conflicting opinions on what the state's
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
interests are in the same docket
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
or in the same proceeding and so we
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
if we work that out i think everything
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the intent of this
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
was to make that type of decision with
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and not with
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
and uh so maybe we need to make sure
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's clarified in here because
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's clearly uh two different
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
things in the past it's been the uh uh
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
nesco managers have been uh
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
as you know have been uh from the
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
commission and uh they've attended all
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
the regional hearings and so forth and
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
now that authority has gone over to the
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh to the department of energy so it
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
would be pretty difficult if they didn't
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
have the ability to give the position of
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire whether it's
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
nesco or ferc or whatever because you
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
kind of have two different opinions so i
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
think the way that um that's being
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
looked at currently is that the
 
01:19:58.239 --> 01:19:59.189 align:start position:0%
looked at currently is that the
um

01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
nesco support function
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
is at the department but the nesco
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
manager which is a government governor
 
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.910 align:start position:0%
manager which is a government governor
appointment

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
can be anyone
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
but the support for that position would
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
be at the department
 
01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.750 align:start position:0%
be at the department
so

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
probably no reason why the nesco manager
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't be a puc commissioner
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
right so
right

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
right
so

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
i suppose that
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's because i don't think
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
the the nesco situation is
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's a statute that
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
addresses that specifically other than
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
what's right here yeah i would think
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
that would be very confusing if you had
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
the puc commissioner as a nesco manager
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then you had a the staff and the
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
people going to all the meetings and
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
going down to the you know the i used to
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
refer them as the burrows for those
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
endless meetings down there uh working
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
for the doe that would be kind of a oh
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay i don't have to pay attention to
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
you you don't work for me or i don't
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
work for you that's
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i think that was
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone have any other
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh and i open this up to
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
anybody that wants fred
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes who is drafting the additional
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
changes to hp 1258 for representative
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.679 --> 01:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for volunteering david yeah
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
obviously it's got to go through well
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
ols but we want to start with language
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
to them right okay
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
and uh again i'll open this up to
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
anybody now that might have questions of
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
the representatives from doe uh i know
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
donna you presented some comments did
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
you want to uh
 
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
you want to uh
uh

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you have to use a mic though okay
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just wanted to say that
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
their explanation today um clarified any
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the remaining questions that we had
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
and in particular what we had
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern was the crossing
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
license and we had chatted with them
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
about that in advance so we knew that
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
they were going to be coming in and
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarifying and today's clarification
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
covers everything so unless something
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
new comes up i'm going to take these
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
notes back but i think for now we're
 
01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.470 align:start position:0%
notes back but i think for now we're
good

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
great so we give you the speaker of the
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
day award thank you well while we're on
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
the crossing i just want to um clarify
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
that what we're hoping to do
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
bring everybody into the tent on
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
crossings so everybody has to get a a
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
license right no exemptions
 
01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
license right no exemptions
right

01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
but that the
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
rigors of getting that license would
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
depend on what kind of crossing it was
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
so if it is a
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
non-electrical wire
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
going across
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
two existing poles on a crossing
 
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.350 align:start position:0%
two existing poles on a crossing
right

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
that review that that application in
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
that review might be less stringent than
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
a review for new polls on a new crossing
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
right so that everything
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
sort of matches you know in terms of how
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
burdensome the uh the review needs to be
 
01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
burdensome the uh the review needs to be
right

01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
because i you know i know people people
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
were concerned with you know
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
if they had to change
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
just a signal wire at the top of their
 
01:23:46.239 --> 01:23:47.510 align:start position:0%
just a signal wire at the top of their
poles

01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
poles
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
they would have to go through a full
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication to do that
 
01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.310 align:start position:0%
adjudication to do that
with

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
an incredibly long application to do
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
that and it's not really necessary
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
for a signal wire at the top of two
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
existing poles because it doesn't really
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
affect anything
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh we would try to develop rules and
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
applications that that matched the type
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
of crossing
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and of course the public
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
and um any representative who wanted to
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the utilities would all be able to
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
participate in that rulemaking
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
and have an effect on that
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
and i was just going to add that that is
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
really the process where we believe that
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
we would be putting our energies as well
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
just a final thing as i'm looking back
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
at some of my notes from the previous
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
one so the puc has now uh agreed that
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be able to demand
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
audits because they'll take place
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
whenever they're necessary and
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
the poll attachments there on board with
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
what you've presented as well yes okay
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
my question is on page two at the bottom
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh i had some things highlighted in here
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill 1258
 
01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill 1258
um

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
at the bottom
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it's line 36. we're removing that
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
orders final orders that come out from
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
the commission have to
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
include the positions of each party on
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
each issue
 
01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
and i just have a question there because
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think those final orders in many cases
 
01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.430 align:start position:0%
i think those final orders in many cases
are

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know a nod to transparency in the
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
state in terms of how the parties in in
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
a proceeding
 
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.229 align:start position:0%
a proceeding
um

01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know how they make their cases in
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
terms of whatever's coming out in those
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork wise people might not want to
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
have to present the positions of the
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
parties but transparency wise i think
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in the statute so i wish
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
you could speak to that
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
change was made at the request of the
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
 
01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission
not

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
by the department
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
but i would note that
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't forbid them
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
from putting in the positions of the
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
parties in an appropriate order just
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't require it just doesn't require
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
it so
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
um you know there are some sort of
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
smaller orders
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
where it would be nice just to be able
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do them with dispatch
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
right um rather than going through them
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
well yeah that also may add to that you
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
when you go to the website uh where the
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
let's say the final order is there
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the positions of all
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
the parties this is a summarized version
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's written by a lawyer at the
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
at the puc and kind of interpreting what
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
the party's position was the whole
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
position in maybe 50 60 pages for every
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
detail you want is right there on the
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
same website and it's simply a matter of
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
just clicking on that and you can get
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
the whole thing this this position is a
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
summary done by the staff of the puc so
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's there's some value to it
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
but it's not uh it's not the same as
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
going back and reading the actual
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
position which is very accessible for
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
people okay and i saw somebody over here
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
jackie do you have a question was it lee
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i had i had a comment and a
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
question the comment was one on a minor
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
comment was on language of confidential
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
maybe legally there's a difference
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
between proprietary and confidential
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
i would rather see conf proprietary
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
inserted in those places
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
if the department of energy does not
 
01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
if the department of energy does not
want

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
or does not believe that an audit needs
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
to take place and the puc say believes
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
a more accurate decision they need an
 
01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
a more accurate decision they need an
audit

01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
who prevails or how does that get worse
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
is that just a thing you work out
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
between yourselves and say okay we'll do
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
it or no we're not gonna and that's it
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
i i just wondered how that
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
one the public utilities commission
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
has the statutory authority to conduct
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
an audit
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
right so if it wants an audit conducted
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
it can order one
 
01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.910 align:start position:0%
it can order one
right

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.590 align:start position:0%
right
but

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
then the next question is when should
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
the department do that
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it should be the department
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
the problem with the language that's
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
before you is that it's very broad
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
right and it doesn't give anybody
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
any real understanding of what audits
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission might be
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
requiring of the department
 
01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:50.470 align:start position:0%
requiring of the department
right

01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
we feel confident that we'll be able to
 
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.270 align:start position:0%
we feel confident that we'll be able to
work

01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
out an agreement and standard operating
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
give the
 
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.750 align:start position:0%
give the
commission

01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
and everyone the assurance that they
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
need that audits that need to be
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
conducted will be conducted
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually hard to imagine what
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
what else they would require that we're
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
not already doing
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
and if
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
somehow the situation arose that the
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
department felt it wasn't necessary or
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have the staffing at that time
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
because of other issues the puc still
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
has a budget for this and they could go
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
outside and hire a private consulting
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
firm to do this i assume well
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
right the puc has a
 
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.390 align:start position:0%
right the puc has a
budget

01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
for consultants which could be an audit
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
right um but that's quite small the
 
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.669 align:start position:0%
right um but that's quite small the
the

01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
normal way to charge that would be by
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
special assessment on the utility being
 
01:29:45.199 --> 01:29:46.550 align:start position:0%
special assessment on the utility being
audited

01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
audited
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
right so that
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's just that utility that pays for the
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
audit but they would have the option of
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
doing that as my point yeah both both
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission and the
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
department have the option of doing that
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
fred glenn this is a question for the
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chairman and the full
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
committee chairman uh when is it
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
necessary to have an amendment to be
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
able to run through ols to keep us on
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
schedule i'll defer to uh mr votes on
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
that one yeah let's uh defer that
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
question until we have completely
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
illuminated all the issues with regard
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the content of the amendment then
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'll speak to the
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the timing of the amendment
 
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.229 align:start position:0%
to the timing of the amendment
so

01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%

an issue of concern that
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
the department might also respond to um
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%

01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh of complaints excuse me could you
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
give us the page number oh on page four
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.550 --> 01:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i spoke i spoke with mr shulock
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit uh before you
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
started and so he may have a view on
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
basically uh under the pucs traditional
 
01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.550 align:start position:0%
basically uh under the pucs traditional
rules

01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint and i should say
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
that five years ago one court street
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
associates filed a complaint
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
as a customer of liberty utilities that
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
liberty utilities was failing to
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
meet a statutory requirement a rules
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
requirement and also tariff issues
 
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.189 align:start position:0%
requirement and also tariff issues
um

01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:49.199 --> 01:31:50.229 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
they they responded and um
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
the long and short of that is it's we've
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
been in limbo for four years on that
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
case um
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
the department or the former puc staff
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%

01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
the long and short of that is that
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
liberty proposed sort of a compromise
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
solution that would require agreement by
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and the city
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
of lebanon and i i don't can't represent
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
the city in this matter because i have a
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know a private interest in the
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
matter and and the city manager said he
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
was not interested in in doing what
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh liberty utilities proposed
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and so we didn't even go to the state
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire because basically would
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
have the state and the city and a couple
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
other private parties assume
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility for a piece of equipment
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that um that houses the point of
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
interconnection for about five or six
 
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
different um retail services or our
 
01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
retail customers where they uh
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's the point of interconnection
 
01:32:52.159 --> 01:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
it's the point of interconnection
between

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
liberties uh
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
load side bus bar of their transformer
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
and where these different businesses
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
including the state of new hampshire and
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
the city of new lebanon take power uh um
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
inside this piece of equipment that that
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
the entity that originally paid for it
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
no longer exists um because they were
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
required to pay for it as an upgrade for
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
their own interconnection uh uh for for
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
retail service so the long and short of
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
that is no nobody owns
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
liberty's disclaiming ownership of the
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
property even though it houses the piece
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
of interconnection so so the problem is
 
01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
when this law went into effect
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
it seems to override the procedural
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
rules which basically say after the
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
independent investigation if there isn't
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
sort of a resolution of the matter
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
that's satisfactory uh the customer can
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
request a hearing by the commission to
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
resolve the matter through an
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
adjudication um
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
and right now with this new law saying
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's in effect saying only the
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
department can bring the proceeding over
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the puc
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
so if we're yeah and and the commission
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
just a week ago asked for status update
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
they directed that to the department of
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
energy which was the responsible party
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
for investigating the complaint i we
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
because of the change in the law we
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't really have any say in that status
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
update i i don't think i don't know
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
but it was directed to the department um
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
and and so the concern is
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
if for instance the parts department
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
said you know we'll we'll try to work
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
this out you can close the case
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what it means that a
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
case that was started five years ago you
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
know if if the new law suddenly means
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
we've we've voided our due process
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
rights in in that proceeding but my
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
concern is if if a party isn't satisfied
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the disposition of a complaint by
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
the department they would do not appear
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
to have any recourse
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the puc to adjudicate the matter
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
and it was commented earlier that in a
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
complaint i think representative kelly
 
01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
pitts was you know thinking about a
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
shutoff type situation
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
that if if the customer is not satisfied
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
well they could appeal the department's
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
decision to the supreme court but the
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
problem is the department doesn't have
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
the requirement to
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the issue in the first place
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
nor to write a sort of findings of fact
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
reasoning of the reasoning or you know
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
rulings on the legal questions the puc
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
is perfectly well suited to do exactly
 
01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
is perfectly well suited to do exactly
that

01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so i think you know my concern is
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
due process for anybody who has a
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
complaint that i don't think the supreme
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
court will be interested in trying to
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
resolve a matter when there is not a
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
record of the type that the puc produces
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
you you don't have i mean the department
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
might do that they might try to write
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
something up that looks like okay we've
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
we've we've this is our opinion on how
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
this should be resolved but it's it's
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
not an actual
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
adjudication you haven't had your day in
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
court so to speak so it's hard to i
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
think it would be very difficult to
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
appeal that kind of decision to the
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
supreme court so so i i and and um i
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
think mr schlock was sort of mentioned
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
that he was aware that the department's
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
aware of this sort of
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
issue and and and so uh he said you know
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
maybe they'd consider you know they
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
consider some language
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i've just sort of drafted out
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
something and i'll just throw it out for
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
your consideration what if and in
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
section 10 you added a sentence at the
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
end that read something like this if the
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
party bringing the complaint
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
is unsatisfied
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
with the disposition of the complaint by
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
the department of energy they may
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
request a hearing before the commission
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
to resolve the matter through an
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceeding and then both the
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
parties the utility
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
and and the customer
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
can have sort of their day um in which
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
then there's a record established i mean
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
there's a huge amount of filings already
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the case
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know to to substantiate our claim
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
and of course liberty responded you know
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
they kind of know that this is a a
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem as well and they tried to do a
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
compromise which would have been okay
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
with us but it wasn't okay with other
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
parties that would have to assume
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
response collective responsibility for a
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
piece of equipment that other parties
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
didn't think they wanted to assume
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
because it sure looks like a part of the
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
distribution system because
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know it includes stuff that liberty
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
owns it in it and this stuff is rusting
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
so that's you know our local electrical
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
inspection said there's an electrical
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
hazard here because some of this stuff
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
could is rusting and it could collapse
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
and cause everyone to lose service but
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's willing to take responsibility
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
for it you know it's not something we
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's not on our property we never paid
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
for it you know it serves a whole bunch
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
of other customers it's like why should
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
we assume responsibility for this piece
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
of equipment so i mean that's the nature
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
of the problem um
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry to share the specifics of
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
our case but it illustrates
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
um it's just a case in point is how do
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
you get due process
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
david you want to address that so
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
with regard to the specifics of the case
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
i haven't reviewed the docket but it
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like i would stay away from the
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
specifics in the case here just for
 
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.590 align:start position:0%
specifics in the case here just for
example

01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
it does sound like a docket was opened
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and that the public utilities
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
commission has retained jurisdiction
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
over it because they haven't closed or
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
transferred the docket
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:34.310 align:start position:0%
to the department
so

01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
one we would have to look at the
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
specifics of those and i can't do that
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
here right then
 
01:38:40.159 --> 01:38:42.830 align:start position:0%
here right then
secondly

01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
that there are some issues related to
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
how complaints would be referred right
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
or um
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
i i guess more appropriately stated
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
dismissed if the department were to find
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
that there were no basis for the
 
01:38:58.719 --> 01:38:59.830 align:start position:0%
that there were no basis for the
complaint

01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.590 align:start position:0%
complaint
right

01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
and where
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take this language back
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
to the department and to the public
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
utilities commission to have it vetted
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
but i i can't agree to it here yeah
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's fine that was what i was going to
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
suggest i think that um
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
i know there are other departments like
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
des that issues rulings and those the uh
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
the appellate uh
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
organization is the supreme court i'm
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
not just sure if the department of
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
energy is set up because it sounds like
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of the rulings are going to be
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
appealed through the puc
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's the way we should do it
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
on this case there but taking the
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
language back and getting back to us
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
would be certainly appreciate i think i
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
think there's some merit and what was uh
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
what clifton said there because you kind
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
of leave people with no place to go
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
and you know if they say no
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
and there's not even a real adjudicative
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
process how do you appeal that to the
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
supreme court because you have no
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
documentations to bring to the court to
 
01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:00.070 align:start position:0%
documentations to bring to the court to
appeal

01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.189 align:start position:0%
appeal
well

01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's if we didn't produce
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
documentation right so we haven't gone
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
through this yet
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
but um i do
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
view this as at least
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
partly judicial when we're deciding
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's no merit to your case and we
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
would have to we would have to issue
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
something jackie go ahead
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
as being one of the quote-unquote
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
normal people that i heard
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
bandied around today what happens or
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
and because i don't have the
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
organization down pat does the consumer
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
advocate can this consumer advocate
 
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
advocate can this consumer advocate
mediate

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
mediate
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
for a
consumer

01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm not talking about a large
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
conglomerate i'm talking about me the
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
normal citizen because that's still an
 
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:50.950 align:start position:0%
normal citizen because that's still an
office

01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
right and then if i look at the or if i
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
think about the organization right now
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of the organization as
 
01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.830 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of the organization as
doe

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
puc a consumer advocate is supposed to
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
stand alone where does all this meld
 
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
stand alone where does all this meld
together

01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.709 align:start position:0%
together
and

01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
can that happen there is a consumer
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
division i am assuming in your
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
where does the consumer advocate come in
 
01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.830 align:start position:0%
where does the consumer advocate come in
so

01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
there is the consumer office of the
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate and then there's the
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
consumer division within the department
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
right used to be the consumer division
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
of the puc okay
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
and their functions have remained the
 
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.149 align:start position:0%
and their functions have remained the
same

01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:41:34.159 --> 01:41:34.870 align:start position:0%
same
so

01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
the office of consumer advocate
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
represents the interests of residential
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
rate payers generally
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
not any individual rate payer right so
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
were you to go to the office of consumer
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
advocate and say i'm having
 
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
problems paying my electric bill can you
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
help me get a payment plan the consumer
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
advocate would send you to our consumer
 
01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
advocate would send you to our consumer
division

01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.430 align:start position:0%
division
right

01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
um at the department and the department
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
would help you communicate with your
 
01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.229 align:start position:0%
would help you communicate with your
utility

01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
utility
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
would tell you what
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
sort of protections you have in the
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
situation and what you don't have in the
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
situation what protections the utility
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
has in the situation
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
and would work with you in a discussion
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
with the utility to to get you a payment
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
particular decision whatever it may be
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
if it's not satisfactory
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
to the consumer is then my understanding
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
the way the bill stands now the consumer
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
cannot take that
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
to an adjudicative
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
position to the puc
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct so if the consumer were
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
unhappy in that situation
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer could file a formal
 
01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.430 align:start position:0%
the consumer could file a formal
complaint

01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
that would then be investigated to
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
determine whether by the department
 
01:43:00.239 --> 01:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
determine whether by the department
right

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.149 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
to determine whether there was a
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
an adequate basis to it to send it to
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
adjudication at the puc and that would
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
original decision
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
yes the department of energy
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
just just so i'm clear on that though
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be necessarily the same i
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
mean i'll just use names so they go to
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
them they call amanda i have a complaint
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
i've got to work out something with the
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
by utility and they come to some what
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
they think is a resolution the complaint
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
and says i'm not satisfied with this so
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
i want to fall file a formal complaint
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
the formal complaint doesn't go back to
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
the same people that tried to work out
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
the thing it would go to a higher up
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
level on the doe
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:51.119 --> 01:43:52.790 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
the original issue let's say it's the
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs division they make a
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
decision this is this is an equitable
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
resolution so if the complaint says no
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's not right i want to file a formal
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
complaint who do they go to okay so
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
say it's something like
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
my telephone company is charging me
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
for two basic telephone lines when i
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
only have one
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay right
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:44:22.950 --> 01:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
basic being the key word because if
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's anything other than that the puc
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
has no authority to regulate or the or
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
the department right
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that would come to our consumer
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
services division they would work with
 
01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:35.830 align:start position:0%
services division they would work with
you

01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
you
right

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.310 align:start position:0%
right
if

01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
if
they

01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
they
agreed

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
with the utility
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
that it were appropriate to charge you
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
for two lines
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
they would tell you that
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
if you were dissatisfied with that
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
you would file
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:44:55.199 --> 01:44:56.629 align:start position:0%
um and
normally

01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
normally
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
you'd be working with one of the staff
 
01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.669 align:start position:0%
you'd be working with one of the staff
representatives

01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
within that division right that staff
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative would be supervised
 
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:06.390 align:start position:0%
representative would be supervised
by

01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
by
the

01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
director of the consumer services
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
division who is supervised by the
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
director of the regulat the
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
policies and programs division who is
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
supervised by
 
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
supervised by
the

01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner and the
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
if you were dissatisfied with that
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
decision you would file a complaint that
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
complaint would be reviewed by the legal
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.470 align:start position:0%
complaint would be reviewed by the legal
division

01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
division
and

01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
and
by

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
probably the director of the consumer
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
yes so it's the same department likely
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
different individuals
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay but but that gets us back to what
 
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
the clifton had brought up and you're
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
going to take that back and look at it
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
so the the individual under his wording
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
would then have the option to file with
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
the puc and say open an adjudicative
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
process on this but we're not saying you
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that but you're going to look
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else peter
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is not a comment about the bill
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
but it kind of resonates with what
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
jackie was talking about for trying to
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
where everything belongs
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
um i sent
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
i sent you michael a list of ten
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions that really had to do with
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
giving us more thorough information
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
about exactly how this reorganization
 
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.189 align:start position:0%
about exactly how this reorganization
looks

01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
looks
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
what got transferred who's who has the
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
authority who has the regulatory
 
01:46:45.679 --> 01:46:47.750 align:start position:0%
authority who has the regulatory
authority

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
posted a bunch of questions relating to
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
the the presentation we got back in may
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy about how
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
they expect things to shuffle around
 
01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:00.790 align:start position:0%
they expect things to shuffle around
um

01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
i i would hope that and this is not just
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
for this this subcommittee i think our
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
whole committee should get a more
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
thorough briefing in what has happened
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
what the orc sharks look like who's
 
01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
what the orc sharks look like who's
responsible

01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
for example what about the sec where
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
does that fit into this whole thing like
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
jackie was saying the consumer
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
advocate where does that fit in who they
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
report to uh
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
what kind of independence is there
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
between each each entity
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
all these are questions that we never
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
had a chance to discuss
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to see us at some point give
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
the whole committee a more thorough
 
01:47:37.119 --> 01:47:38.229 align:start position:0%
the whole committee a more thorough
review

01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
of not just this bill and the amendments
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
but basically what the new organization
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
as you all probably know most most
 
01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
democrats in the past have always
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
supported a department of energy because
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
we thought it was important to have
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
those consolidated efforts made
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
however right now a lot of things are
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
just up in flux
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we just don't know
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
where everything is who's responsible
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
for it and i think it would be very
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
useful if the department could provide
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
us with some of that information and i
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
can give you the yeah
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
just for a copy of what peter said to me
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think what he said is right on point
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a little above this so i'll
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
defer to the chairman on this but i
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that one of the issues we run into
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
constantly on this committee is people
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
come up to us and ask us questions
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
because and they want yes or no answers
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
because if you give them anything that
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
lasts more than 30 seconds they say i
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the hell you're
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
talking about so we really need to be
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
able to address some of the questions he
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh addressed here so
 
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
i will leave that to the chairman to
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
make that decision i have one more thing
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
to add if i may
 
01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.709 align:start position:0%
to add if i may
um

01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
the way i look at it i i agree with you
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
that the org chart i mean it it's pretty
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
the york chart they gave us is pretty
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
clear to me i would love to have them
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
come back and tell us if that's how it's
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
being implemented and also if all the
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
roles that they needed to fill are all
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
filled and all that i'd like to know how
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's operating now
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
but i think my concern
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
from looking through eight from reading
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
through hb2's language on the
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
enactment of the doe to now
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission as an
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
entity and a regulatory body was very
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
well established and very well defined
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
and in statute in terms of its
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
authorities its requirements what it
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for although we
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
have the org chart that breaks down
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
what will be happening in the department
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
of energy i think that the doe
 
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:31.350 align:start position:0%
of energy i think that the doe
has

01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
a less defined
 
01:49:33.599 --> 01:49:36.709 align:start position:0%
a less defined
operating

01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
charge in terms of statute and so
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's partly why you're having
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
that request for edits here is that you
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
if you put both names in a place and say
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
well now we're both going to straddle
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
that responsibility
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
but you don't have the statutory
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
obligations that are written
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
it makes it really confusing to sort of
 
01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
keep up with
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
are all the bases still covered
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
are we still
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
are we still operating in an environment
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
where we get as much out of our
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
regulatory procedures as we did in the
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
past and i think we're trying to get
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
some understanding of that to make sure
 
01:50:16.719 --> 01:50:17.830 align:start position:0%
some understanding of that to make sure
that

01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
that we're not okaying bills that are
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
allowing us to go to
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
a situation where we have an agency that
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
has the
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
has the authority or the power
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
but not the responsibility
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the responsibility
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
pieces for the public utilities
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
commission were highly defined
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
how they operated was highly defined
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
um and i and i think even something as
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
simple as having your own investigators
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you operate with
 
01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:51.430 align:start position:0%
that you operate with
openly

01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
openly
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
versus having investigators that belong
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
to a department that you are now housed
 
01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:58.070 align:start position:0%
to a department that you are now housed
within

01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh can influence how the investigations
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
go and and even though i'm not i'm not
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
saying that will happen
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'm saying it's um
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's a less
 
01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:11.750 align:start position:0%
it's a less
efficacious

01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
efficacious
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh setup to have uh the people that are
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
providing you with the information of
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
how to look at a case come from
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
an agency that's not governed by those
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
same regulatory requirements
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to jump in here and
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
state that
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
01:51:29.599 --> 01:51:30.390 align:start position:0%
i agree
that

01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
presentation by the department to the
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.109 align:start position:0%
full committee
to

01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
explain exactly
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
who does what
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
when and how
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
would be very useful
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we will try to set that up it may
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
not be possible to do it between now and
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
may 26th when our official session year
 
01:51:53.679 --> 01:51:54.870 align:start position:0%
may 26th when our official session year
ends

01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
ends
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
by next fall
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
at the latest we'll arrange that with
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
the department and have a
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
a presentation have a
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
essentially a work session with the
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
fully understand just how the department
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
of energy and the public utilities
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
commission are functioning these days i
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
have to leave at 12 so i'd like to
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
address the
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
procedural issues that we face with this
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee going forward
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
it is my intention
 
01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.149 align:start position:0%
it is my intention
to

01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
exec the remaining stne bills on
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
february 28th
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
and march 1st
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
therefore any amendment that's going to
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
be attached to this bill 1258
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be completed
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
by friday
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
february 25th
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
now i assume this committee would like
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee would like to meet
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
and discuss that amendment
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
before it's
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
judged by the committee so i would
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
suggest that this subcommittee may want
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
to meet again
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
on february 22nd 23rd
 
01:53:10.639 --> 01:53:12.629 align:start position:0%
on february 22nd 23rd
24th

01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
24th
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
with an amendment in hand that it can
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
review and make changes to so that a
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
final amendment could be produced by the
 
01:53:19.119 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
final amendment could be produced by the
25th

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
25th
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
i committee we have to book two two two
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
two two what do you think
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
fred come on
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
if anybody should know
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
the attractiveness of that idea it
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
should be you yeah
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think does that work let's
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
everyone please check your calendars as
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
well as we like the people from d.o.e
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
here again and anybody else so uh if uh
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
that tuesday the 22nd does that give
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
everybody does that give the doe enough
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
time to make the changes that we've
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
discussed here
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
one more step in that is we have to have
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
language from the doe to submit through
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
ols and even if we're submitting
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
language they still have to review it
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
make sure they're okay with it so that's
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting that that work possibly
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
so that when you come in on the 22nd
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
you'll have an amendment to evaluate
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
and you can make changes to it and then
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
resubmit it to ols ask ols by wednesday
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
or thursday or friday of that week for a
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
complete final amendment okay so i would
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
be giving
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
either you or representative harrington
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
language to give to ols this week
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
ols would work on preparing something i
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
understand 21st is a holiday too so okay
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's monday of that week so i don't
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
know should we push that to uh instead
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
of that lyrical day should we go to the
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
next one michael i i think i can
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably have language
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
ready by wednesday nope no time pressure
 
01:55:08.719 --> 01:55:10.950 align:start position:0%
ready by wednesday nope no time pressure
yeah

01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay well if you can have that to
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
als by wednesday they should be able to
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
get it to us by the 22nd or by friday i
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
would think okay so that would work so
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
why don't we tentatively look for you
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
submitting by the 16th
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
als getting it to us by the 18th and
 
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:28.070 align:start position:0%
als getting it to us by the 18th and
then

01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
that will okay we'll we'll circulate it
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
around to the whole committee and we'll
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
meet here at
 
01:55:33.119 --> 01:55:34.390 align:start position:0%
meet here at
um

01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
i know peter would suggest 10 o'clock
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
again because he doesn't like nine so if
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
not 10 works for everybody can we

previous week was school vacation week
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
is that not true it depends on the town
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
because a lot of towns don't do it the
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
previous week because it matches
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and we used to have kids
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
