00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
so senator guido can you tell me why
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair senate bill 376. oh okay
 
00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.509 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair senate bill 376. oh okay
good

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
bob dyed a senate district two uh prime
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor senate bill 376 bill that i
 
00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
think is very important to the future
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
and i know the policy issue has been
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
decided there are a couple of changes
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
here the one 1.1 million should be
 
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.350 align:start position:0%
here the one 1.1 million should be
sufficient

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
uh and then in the amendment that's
 
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
presented by john skipper
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have that but i
 
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
wait what amendment was that i'm looking
 
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
at uh
29.88

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
21 april
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
1.2 would suffice um
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
mickey d that that wasn't part of our
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
that wasn't part of what we voted on
 
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
that wasn't part of what we voted on
yesterday

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
i think there was a floor amendment
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
adopted yesterday that increased the
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 1.2 oh and that's in
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
the bill now as amended before this
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee okay i didn't see that that
 
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient uh one so you want
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
1.2 would work i think 1.1 would work it
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
might be tight 1.2 would definitely work
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
i can give you the computation basis for
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.749 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
that number is derived as derived by
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
taking the number of towns and cities
 
00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 align:start position:0%
which is uh
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
221 towns and 13 cities so that's 234
 
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.870 align:start position:0%
221 towns and 13 cities so that's 234
municipalities

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
48 already have one trained cit officer
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the state police have 100 or so trained
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
officers we need 10 sheriff's
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
departments and two corrections
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
facilities to have a person each so that
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
bring the total to
 
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.749 align:start position:0%
bring the total to
um

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.749 align:start position:0%
um
to

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
to
288

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
288
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
officers to be trained okay except we
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
also know that many towns don't have
 
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
police departments okay okay i mean
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
up north we don't have police
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
departments in every town so
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
that would be the committee's discretion
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i just
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
patterning this to get the model out
 
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.909 align:start position:0%
patterning this to get the model out
there

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
so uh at that at forty seven hundred
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
dollars uh it's forty the high 46 and
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
change per training
 
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh for each officer the cost the total
 
00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.070 align:start position:0%
uh for each officer the cost the total
costing

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
costing
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh not including the cost of the course
 
00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
uh not including the cost of the course
itself

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
all right so there'd be eight courses at
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
12 500 a piece over over the period of
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
time that would train all the officers
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we want trained by this program now
 
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's not including the towns that
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
officers in them so that's your
 
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
officers in them so that's your
discretion

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
um come up to about a million
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
13 000
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
give or take so 1.1 million would be
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
fine the thing that's that's not in the
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill that needs to be
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
is that these funds need to be
 
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.310 align:start position:0%
is that these funds need to be
non-lapsing

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
because they're going to go over the end
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
and so the anticipation is that they
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
would train one class for each of the
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
next eight months and if you notice i
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
think the bill as i saw it now i'm not
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
sure is what you have
 
00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.070 align:start position:0%
sure is what you have
uh

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
made these funds expendable by or
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
appropriate these funds for the year
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
ending june of 22
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending 30 june 23. okay then
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's been repaired okay
 
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.110 align:start position:0%
that's been repaired okay
um

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's about it i would ask the
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
committee to you know keep its pencil
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
sharp but this is definitely a program
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
that's needed
 
00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.350 align:start position:0%
that's needed
um

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
i had a call this morning 20 minutes on
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
the phone from a gal that was arrested
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
and cuffed she was a rape victim and and
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
ptsd in the whole nine yards and the
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
chief had to come tell the young officer
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
to take the cuffs off mm-hmm you know
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
she was stopped for
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
minor infraction
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
and when she saw the police officer get
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
all frazzled and those types of things
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
happen so this training is necessary and
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate your
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know your support for it will i
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
answer any questions no i don't have any
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative heath has
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
one um now will that i didn't read all
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
this i'm sorry um
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
will the training come out of our police
 
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.749 align:start position:0%
will the training come out of our police
standards

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:14.790 align:start position:0%
standards
training

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
the funding well yeah the training
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
courses will be approved because
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
currently police standards and training
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
does one course but there is another
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
outside agency it might be nami but
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
there's another agency that does it
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
they'd have to be approved by police
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
standards and training okay the funding
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
would all be done through the
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
administration of police standards and
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
training with this one point one great
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
uh mickey i do have a question
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
i'm not real sure that that's correct is
 
00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.749 align:start position:0%
i'm not real sure that that's correct is
it

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
in what
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
in what way the appropriation is
 
00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.469 align:start position:0%
in what way the appropriation is
non-lapsing

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
that was part of the floor amendment
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
that was adopted yesterday as well so
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's appropriated in fiscal 23
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
for the purposes stated in section 7 of
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't have to have the
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
governor draw a warrant or anything like
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
that uh there there is warrant language
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
standard warrant language uh on the very
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
tail end of the bill uh starting on line
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
11 on page three oh you mean i only read
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
to line ten
 
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
to line ten
[Laughter]

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
line 11.
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay i don't have line 11.
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
and and just make sure everyone does
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
have them the proper version of this
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill uh it was amended yesterday so the
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
amendment would have been
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
four h hopefully you see that in the top
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
okay okay so this is old
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
the one i had it could if it was as
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate that's a a
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
it should say as amended by the house is
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
the most recent current version of this
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
correct that's the current version
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
correct okay uh the other thing that i
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
have is
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
to create another board
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
since we
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
already have this new
 
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.509 align:start position:0%
already have this new
board

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
that created out of leak
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
i don't i just
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
i think we just need one
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
one people
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
one group of people from
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the this new board is
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
made up of and it was kind of a cross
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
section of um
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
of officers that i i'm just not
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
real excited about
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
creating another board and police
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
so if i may madam chair um this board
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
would not be overseen by police
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
standards in training this would be an
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
independent board this is a study
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee to look at establishing a
 
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.150 align:start position:0%
committee to look at establishing a
board

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
currently as you know the attorney
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
general investigates every every
 
00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:12.630 align:start position:0%
general investigates every every
shooting

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
shooting
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
their determination however is
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
exclusively limited to the to the
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
criminality or not of the actual
 
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.829 align:start position:0%
criminality or not of the actual
justification

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
justification
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the use of lethal force
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to address
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
whether there might have been
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
instances or or circumstances that would
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
have allowed an intervention prior to
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
getting to that point ergo the mental
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
health issue this board would only look
 
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.829 align:start position:0%
health issue this board would only look
at

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
components of any shooting to see if
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's anything we can adjust in our
 
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
there's anything we can adjust in our
training

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
for police officers going forward or how
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
we might adjust our current policies
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's not within the purview of the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
board from lee act this one is
 
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.230 align:start position:0%
board from lee act this one is
specifically

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
and exclusively for mental health review
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
of police shooting incidents none of the
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
information can be disclosed similar to
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital situation hospitals have a
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
review board as well
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that none of that can be used it
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be okay so who who is going to
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
control this board
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
well that would be determined by the
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
study committee that's going to
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether to establish the board
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
so this bill doesn't establish a board
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
it establishes a study committee because
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's very sensitive issue police
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
officers don't want you know they're
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
worried about you know how could this be
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
used or not so rather than establish
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
that board we're establishing a study
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee to look at establishing the
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
board i think that's an important
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
component of this
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not a fan of study committees as you
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
know but in this case i think this needs
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
somebody else asked a question so you
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
know i mean i'm just wondering though
 
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.910 align:start position:0%
know i mean i'm just wondering though
would

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
could the study committee be
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
could this be rewarded that the study
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee would with its jaw its purpose
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
would be to see
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee established under laid act
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
could be expanded not expanded but its
 
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
could be expanded not expanded but its
duties

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
duties
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know increased to encompass what you
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
want here because it does seem like to i
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
mean to just have two
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
you know to to have two separate
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
committees looking at that
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
let's say a police use of deadly force
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
rather than you know each with a sort of
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
a separate assignment rather than one
 
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.949 align:start position:0%
a separate assignment rather than one
committee

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know that's that kind of worries me
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
well it worries me too and that
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know how i'm not sure that this
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
would this language is in conflict with
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
what you're saying right it would study
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
establishing a mental health incident
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
review board it that doesn't preclude it
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
from looking at
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
considering the leak established board
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
as that board
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
i got that but when you say establishing
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
a mental health incident review board
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
without saying
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
whatever the name of the
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
the liaic board is and i've forgotten
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
that i i just
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
i just think that
 
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.550 align:start position:0%
i just think that
all

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
police review stuff okay
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's for mental health or it's
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
for other things
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be in police standards and
 
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.310 align:start position:0%
needs to be in police standards and
training

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.629 align:start position:0%
training
because

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
the goal is that i would i would
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
disagree pretty strenuously madam sure
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason is this this board is not
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
the conduct of police officers relative
 
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.990 align:start position:0%
the conduct of police officers relative
to

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
anything other than mental health right
 
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
and if the leak commission has mental
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
health experts on it
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
psych psychologists and so forth that's
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
one thing i'm not sure that composition
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
exists on that committee but it could be
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
expanded to
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
not not on um
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
not on a full-time basis
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
but if you're you know the the key thing
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
with police standards and training in my
 
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
with police standards and training in my
opinion

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
is that they need to know what's going
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
on out there so they can adjust the
 
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
on out there so they can adjust the
training

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
the feedback may not be there and that's
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's the part
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
that concerns me more than anything
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair i agree with a lot of things
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying but i also agree with
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
senator gaida could it be a subcommittee
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
so there's an inherent communication
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
tool built in
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
so that there's a standing group of
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
individuals that are part of the leak
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
um there are standards in training that
 
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.910 align:start position:0%
um there are standards in training that
that

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
will respond because the issue is a
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
serious one
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it's ongoing and it seems to be new
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
things keep happening i would not be a
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
verse to language that establishes a
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
subset of lee act that's dedicated to
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
a mental health review
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh i review the mental health components
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
of shooting incidents
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
that that would be acceptable but i as
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
long as it's clearly stipulated that it
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
isn't as part of lee act which i'm not
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
sure that's in it mental health review
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
board is not in part of its current
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
language no it's it's not
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
mickey can you fix that
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
you can fix any
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
so so just to kind of
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
summarize th this bill sets up a
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee that's
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
correct to to come up with a proposal
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
for establishing an in perpetuity right
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
committee based on whoever it determines
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
is your intention here to change the
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
charge of a legislative study committee
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
or to establish a different committee
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
with appointed members besides
 
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.749 align:start position:0%
with appointed members besides
legislators

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
no this it's to
 
00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.189 align:start position:0%
no this it's to
ensure

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:56.949 align:start position:0%
ensure
that

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
whatever they decide
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
becomes part of whatever this other
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
board is
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
and how that's worked out in the study
 
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.509 align:start position:0%
and how that's worked out in the study
committee

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
is up to them
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
so if i'd point the committee to page
 
00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
so if i'd point the committee to page
two

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
section four of the bill the committee's
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
duties you'd want to
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
clarify in there that
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
part of its recommendation should be to
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.269 align:start position:0%
consider that
to

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
not only consider it
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
that it should be part of their
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
okay
and

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
so for example could it say i mean would
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
you both be would you be comfortable
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
with this not saying something like
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
the committee shall
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
shall study
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.749 align:start position:0%
shall study
um

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:48.790 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
establishing within the whatever the
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the late act committee within
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
the late act commission
 
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.870 align:start position:0%
the late act commission
commission

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.069 align:start position:0%
commission
um

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.670 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
a mental uh
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
mental health review mental health
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
mental health uh or giving that giving
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
that commission authority to to
 
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
that commission authority to to
review

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
menta the mental health aspects i'm i'm
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
just sort of making it up as i'm going
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
along but basically the mental health
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
aspects of
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement use of deadly force
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
and such non-deadly non-lethal swot
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
engagements that you know as the bill
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
says does that make sense
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't it
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
mickey knows
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll i'll take a look and and see
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
what makes sense to add here and um
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if if the plan is to
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
circle back with an amendment at another
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
day yeah so don't worry about it for i
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
mean i know we have many workspaces
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled coming up i have all kinds of
 
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
scheduled coming up i have all kinds of
time

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
between now and three o'clock on
 
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
between now and three o'clock on
wednesday

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
wednesday
so

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is i i think we um
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
we need to go back to the one point 1.1
 
00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
we need to go back to the one point 1.1
million

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
i just say that we're we're talking
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're just a lot of places that don't
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
have police departments that are
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
considered towns
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
and most of those places are covered by
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
other police departments
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you know i'm fine with that i said
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a police department
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's pretty hard to train somebody in it
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
right so right i don't know those
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
numbers neither neither do i
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
but i know
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
in just in my area
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
you know uh chatham doesn't have a
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
police department
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh albany doesn't have a police
 
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
uh albany doesn't have a police
department

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
tamworth has one police officer
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know that that's just
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
right around conway so
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah would the department be able to
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
ascertain which towns do have police
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
officers and which don't
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
they must
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
i would assume that
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
police standards and training would know
 
00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:07.990 align:start position:0%
police standards and training would know
that

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
that
right

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
am i getting a head shake
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah i'm fine with that you know
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
sharpen the pencil make it work all
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
right sure
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
monday i've got ed i don't and that's
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
gonna take all day i'm afraid so
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
i better recess this till tuesday
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
at we'll take it up the first thing

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay fine we'll
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
hello so for the record i'm chris bond
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
i'm counsel to the department of
 
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
i'm counsel to the department of
education

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm also the attorney general office's
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
client counselor to the department of
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
education so i'm actually
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
here in that capacity as well today
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of the attorney
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
general's office as well who has an
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
interest in this bill and um
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
specifically i
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the committee
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
has questions about the financial impact
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
and my my colleague rebecca fradette
 
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
and my my colleague rebecca fradette
will

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
will be able to speak to that um
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
the uh purpose of my testimony was to
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
reiterate a concern that i had um
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
testified to in front of the uh house ed
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee about
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
um and that is
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
specifically a
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
first circuit holding from a couple of
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
years ago
that

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
creates significant risk that the
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
current law as structured
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
violates the requirements of the idea
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
and so
um

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office feels that
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's significant risk that if the age
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
limitation isn't changed to go through
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
the age 21 inclusive which means up to
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
the 22nd birthday that there's a
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
significant risk that a court would find
 
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.310 align:start position:0%
significant risk that a court would find
that

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
that violates the requirements of the
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
idea and i could speak to that in more
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
detail if you want but we are aware of
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
at least one advocacy group that is
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
preparing a lawsuit they're sort of
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what the resolution of uh
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
of this uh legislative attempt at a fix
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
is um we anticipate that they would sue
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
the state and then we are aware of
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
multiple due process hearings that have
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
been brought against individual school
 
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.990 align:start position:0%
been brought against individual school
districts

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
on the basis of this first circuit case
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's called kl versus board of education
 
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
it's called kl versus board of education
um

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
and uh we know of at least one instance
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
where the parties settled and it's our
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that the district agreed
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
to provide the services
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
as uh as the plaintiffs argued the idea
 
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.269 align:start position:0%
as uh as the plaintiffs argued the idea
required

00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
we're aware of at least one other due
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
process hearing that will probably go
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
forward if and only if the legislature
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't act so my understanding is that
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
what came up when there was a floor
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
amended offered yesterday was some
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
concerns about the fiscal impact um
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
effective date of the age change was
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
made to be effective immediately
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
districts had not had an opportunity to
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to budget for that and plan for that i
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that practical
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
concern i think from a legal perspective
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
the significant risk that the state law
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
is currently in violation of federal law
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
is un is on sort of unmoved by that uh
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
practical consideration in other words
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
um it's uh and i i hesitate to use
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
language that is too um decisive because
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
the state might be in a position of
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
having to defend this law but there's a
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
significant risk that the law uh
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
currently structured violates the idea
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that risk is at all um
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
mitigated by the fact that districts
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to to to plan for
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
that i think the argument would be that
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the we're currently in violation federal
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
law so districts and the state already
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
have this obligation imposed on them by
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
the idea that's the uh at least that's
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
the argument so that's what i wanted to
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee understood um
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions and
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
again to the extent you will have
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
specific um financial impact questions
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you do i'll have to defer
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
those to my colleague uh ms verdette
 
00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
those to my colleague uh ms verdette
okay

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
so attorney bond is
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is right now
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
does this meet the needs
 
00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:31.430 align:start position:0%
does this meet the needs
of

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.029 align:start position:0%
of
idea

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
the the aged language
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh as in the in the draft that i'm
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with that i understand to be
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
the current draft um in my view does
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
meet the
 
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.149 align:start position:0%
meet the
uh

00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
the idea requirement that is the age 21
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
inclusive language that requires the
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
special education services to be
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
provided up to this 22nd birthday i
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
believe that is adequate as far as the
 
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
believe that is adequate as far as the
um

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
effective date i mean i believe that the
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's a significant risk that our law
 
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.070 align:start position:0%
there's a significant risk that our law
is

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.029 align:start position:0%
is
not

00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
um in keeping with the requirements of
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
federal law until that effective date
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
whenever that is so to the extent that
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
the effective date on the on the version
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'd seen was far in the future i think
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe june 2023 i think that there's a
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
significant risk that we would be held
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
to be in violation of the idea
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
but as far as the actual language of the
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
i i think it's sufficient yes okay i i
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that we were
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay here sure
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay so you're suggesting
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
effective date
is

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
or yeah i mean just to be clear i think
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
the the argument
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
is that we are
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
in violation of federal law until that
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
age has changed so
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
the longer we
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
the longer that effective date is pushed
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
out the longer we remain
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
in violation and no longer we're suscept
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
or arguably in violation i should say um
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
we will remain uh you know vulnerable to
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits both at the district level
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
because people have the ability to to uh
 
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.310 align:start position:0%
because people have the ability to to uh
to

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
pursue actions directly against school
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
districts on the basis of the ida and at
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
a state level because we do know that
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
there's a plaintiff that's interested in
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
pursuing us um and other states that
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
those kinds of cases have been
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
successful including in rhode island
 
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.269 align:start position:0%
successful including in rhode island
so

00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
i i always thought that it was
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
21 but obviously that wasn't what was in
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
i knew that i knew the schools had to
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
take care of them through their
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know 21st
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
birthday or whatever but obviously this
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
didn't say that
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
effect is
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
however many
 
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.750 align:start position:0%
however many
children

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
each school district has
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.870 align:start position:0%
that has
disabilities

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
and that seek services because there's
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
no obligation to to stay in and seek
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
those services so i think we can speak
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
generally to the population of children
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
that are hit that age group which is not
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
a large population but then we don't
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
know how many of those will choose to
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
continue um their education because they
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
they aren't required to
 
00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:36.470 align:start position:0%
they aren't required to
okay

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.669 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
yep no problem
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:54.149 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
turn this on so this has long been a
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
problem in school districts um i found
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
out about it simply by happenstance when
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
i was an educator in manchester and had
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
a student that said today's my birthday
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm turning 21 and i can't come to
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
school anymore
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i think there was a shock factor for
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
me and that goes back to i think 1982
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
when i found out about this situation i
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
was so shocked because this young lady
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
didn't have any place to go she had her
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
she was a foster child she'd been signed
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
up for adult services but it took a
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
while for that to keep him but anyway
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this amendment that has
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
just come to me um and i would like to
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
propose it
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
it this amends the bill by replacing all
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
after section 3 with the following
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year ending june 30th
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
2024 the department of education shall
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
be liable for all school district costs
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
related to providing services to special
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
education students over age 21 to age
 
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.350 align:start position:0%
education students over age 21 to age
22.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
the department shall identify a means by
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
distributing reimbursement to school
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
districts within the same fiscal year in
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
which services have been provided
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
provision of such services does not
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
obviate adult development
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
disability services for which a student
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
over 21 years of age may qualify under
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
rsa 171-a
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
now in this amendment i see that we have
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
here it's 24 and then we have the act
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
takes effect 2023
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
so my concern is based on what you just
 
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.310 align:start position:0%
so my concern is based on what you just
said

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
that we have a more urgent need to um
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
initiate this legislation sooner
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
so would you like to see this amendment
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
let's let me just let me just make sure
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
we understand
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is saying that doe will pick up the
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
cost but one year only
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
within the same fiscal year in which
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
services have been provided
 
00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.230 align:start position:0%
services have been provided
yeah

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
well the intent mickey
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
the way this is drafted on line five
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see it says for the fiscal year
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
ending june 30 2024 i think the intent
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
was this would apply to one fiscal year
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
and this would assist districts
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
they have they have a lot of money out
 
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.630 align:start position:0%
they have they have a lot of money out
there

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.149 align:start position:0%
there
seriously

00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
that they haven't claimed for anything
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
which is another issue
 
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.149 align:start position:0%
which is another issue
but

00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
i hate you you know um
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i like this
 
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.630 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i like this
inclusive

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
inclusive

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
and 21 inclusive
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't want to say the age
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
22 because then
 
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.789 align:start position:0%
22 because then
that's

00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
if we're using 21 inclusive then that's
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
the term we should use i think
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that the
 
00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:32.310 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that the
um

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
the bill itself as amended 1538 h
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
with a simple change the effective date
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
upon passage accomplishes what we're
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.389 align:start position:0%
trying to
accomplish

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
without adding
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
an additional amendment to me this
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
amendment for to me is very confusing it
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of throws in a bunch of other
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
things that don't need to be there if we
 
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.909 align:start position:0%
things that don't need to be there if we
simply

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
make the effective date sure so yeah if
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
i can respond to that and also to
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative heath's question so i
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
think i really
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
want to make clear to kind of bifurcate
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
the question of who would pay for the
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
services is a policy decision that the
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office wouldn't weigh
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
in on
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
the question of the effective date of
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
the change to have the age 21 inclusive
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
language that's the issue that we have
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
and i agree that to change it to
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
effective on passage
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
allays that concern the attorney
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
general's office has to the extent
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's a significant risk that we're
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
out of step with the federal requirement
 
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:28.549 align:start position:0%
out of step with the federal requirement
um

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
as for the
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
whether at this amendment i think the
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
ag's office would just be agnostic
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
because it's a policy decision but to
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
the extent that the act's effective date
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
would be july 1 2023 or and uh that
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be problematic and still
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
subject us to significant risk of
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuits based on the federal statute so
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
well i don't like these kind of
 
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.789 align:start position:0%
well i don't like these kind of
surprises

00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
surprises
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to the payment by the
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
department for those students
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
schools have set their budgets at this
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
and if in fact there becomes a
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
the students
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
for whom were were
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
creating this situation or trying to
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
remediate the situation for it's a very
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
very small population of children and i
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
think the department can agree with me
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the children with the absolutely
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
most severe of disabilities some are
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
often in
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
residential placements
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.550 align:start position:0%
residential placements
some

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
require a great deal of support even to
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
remain in a a regular education
 
00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:49.030 align:start position:0%
remain in a a regular education
environment

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
so there's considerable cost so for
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
those school districts that had believed
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
that in fact
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
a number of students would not be part
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
of their school district
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
this would relieve the impact of a
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
change in legislation
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the requirement these children
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
continue to the age of 21 um or
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
however we're going to put it um
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
so it would be a relief to school
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
districts to help them out with their
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
special ed budget mary i need to i need
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
to know what the department is
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
projecting before we argue whether or
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
not we want the department to pay it
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions for uh
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:42.870 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
with the date though that we have to put
 
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.829 align:start position:0%
with the date though that we have to put
yes

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:46.710 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
upon passage okay
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
we've not met before it's a pleasure oh
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
pleasure mine thank you okay
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
all right so who's going to talk about
 
00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
all right so who's going to talk about
money

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is rebecca ferdet
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'm the state director of special
 
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.710 align:start position:0%
i'm the state director of special
education

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
um i we had completed the fiscal note
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill in its original form um
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
and we had been asked
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
about students who were in separate
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
schools and so there are six currently
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the 21 22 school year there were six
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
students who were in a residential
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
placement i mean you can see all of this
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
we were then asked and it's not part of
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note some different questions
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
by representative vlad at the last
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
hearing he had asked how many students
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
were currently 21 within the state and
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
there are currently four students who
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
are 21 within the state um and they are
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
set to graduate at the end of this year
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
there are currently um 186 students who
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
are 20 years old
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the population i think that um
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
was was in question
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay so you said
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
six in residential placements
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
but that was at the beginning of the
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
year so
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
numbers have changed slightly no i mean
 
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:17.670 align:start position:0%
numbers have changed slightly no i mean
yep

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
let's just assume that that's the right
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
number okay i mean when you're when
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking whatever we're talking
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
ten dollars doesn't make up pillow beans
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
and how many or 20
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
so there's 186 that are age 20
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay and there are four that are age 21
 
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.750 align:start position:0%
okay and there are four that are age 21
okay

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
and how many are between 18 and 20.
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
i do not have that number
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
i i would say that it's pretty close to
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
the same for each each age level right
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
around the 186 190 um most most of our
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
population graduates when they're 18 and
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
then it's the population gets smaller
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
and smaller with each year up to 21. so
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i would just
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
just knowing those numbers i would say
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably right around 200 that are
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
19 and then a much larger number in uh
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
age 18 excuse me
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
but the 18 year olds the school is
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
already taking care of them
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
yep most of most of them have gone
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
through when they graduate at 18 um and
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is just the population of 19 to 21
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
now and with this bill would be up to
 
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
now and with this bill would be up to
22.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
and then um you would ask about cost if
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
we so we have a cost per pupil and
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
currently it's right around just under
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
18 000 per child and we pay this out for
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
special education aid with the passage
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
um bill we would be allowed to provide
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
special education aid to students up to
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
age 22 which we have not been able to do
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
um so if a school district had chosen to
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
keep a child after 21 they would pay
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
that out of their own local funds rather
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
than through special education aid or
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
so how did you get to the eighteen
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
thousand per student
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
that comes from caitlyn's office okay
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
well come on up caitlin don't don't be
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
sitting back there in the corner
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.470 align:start position:0%
sitting back there in the corner
thinking

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
thinking i could i don't see you
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
right so um we calculate the average
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil so we do our regular
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
average cost per people then we do an
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
estimated average cost per pupil oh so
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.829 align:start position:0%
this is not
the

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is not just for special ed correct
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
this is for
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
the 18 000 is the average cost per
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
student in school exactly not anything
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
aid yes and that's the number that's
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
then used to generate the three and a
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
half times that is in catastrophic state
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
special education aid
 
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
special education aid
okay

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.790 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.230 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:24.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
do we have to is there
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
is there anything in here
 
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
is there anything in here
that

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.109 align:start position:0%
that
says

00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh children with disability
 
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.190 align:start position:0%
uh children with disability
can

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
go to school
 
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
go to school
yeah

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's probably the wrong term but you
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
know that we would pay
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
the regular adequacy grant for
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
so if um
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
if those kids are to stay in school
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
through 22 we would pay the adequacy
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
grant for those kids during that time
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
period okay no matter what the age
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
as long as they are enrolled
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
yes up to 22. yeah
 
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
yes up to 22. yeah
remember

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
they don't call it candidate but of
 
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.710 align:start position:0%
they don't call it candidate but of
course

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be still eligible for that date
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
sure i believe the difference
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
be terribly significant
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
based on depending upon the percentage
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
at which special ed eight is paid out
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
or that small number of students who
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
might be eligible
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um there probably wouldn't be a large
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
number of but it would um if
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
the districts would have to pay up to
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
the three and a half times right so
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's right around um sixty two
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
thousand 000 so that would be a cost
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
that they had not planned on from 21 to
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
22. and that's what this amendment if we
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
were to accept it would cover
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we would want that 62 000
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
um and i'd want to point out if you if
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
the committee does actually want to do
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
it this way you have about one and a
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
half million dollars of excess
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation from state special
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
education aid in the fiscal year 22
 
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.230 align:start position:0%
education aid in the fiscal year 22
budget

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
um i think the amendment would need to
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
clarify that that money would be
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
specifically used for this and kind of a
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
whole different section written for that
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
but that money would already be existing
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the state budget for that for one
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
you said that was 1.1 i think it's 1.4
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
1.5 million
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's due to um there was
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated about 33 million dollars
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
this past year and our total bill which
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
we pay on january first of every year um
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
was only 31 million dollars so there's
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
some excess appropriation okay
 
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.190 align:start position:0%
some excess appropriation okay
so

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing is that you think you
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
have the dollars to cover
 
00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.109 align:start position:0%
have the dollars to cover
this

00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh so unless every unless all
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
186 students stay until they're 22 if
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
all 186 stay until they're 22 it would
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
be about 3.3 million just for the cost
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
per people
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
but we know that's not going to happen
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
but every team makes a determination
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
they may say the student isn't going to
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
stay they may say the student is
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
i mean that's
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
to those 186 teams to make that
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
determination realistically we don't
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
have the individual expenditure
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
information on these children right now
 
00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:31.030 align:start position:0%
information on these children right now
so

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
so
maybe

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're not children anymore is the
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
problem and that's that's another issue
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
you know when you're 18 you're supposed
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to make decisions for
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
yourself well but for the individu if i
 
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.190 align:start position:0%
yourself well but for the individu if i
may

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
sure for the children
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
young adults for whom we're discussing
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
they really are in need of extensive
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
care oh i don't argue that really are
 
00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:57.430 align:start position:0%
care oh i don't argue that really are
not

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
for many of them
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
moving into adult services
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
is the probably the best option a very
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very one percent one and a
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
half percent maybe we're talking about
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
of of children with disabilities
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
so for that population they should be
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
going into some kind of adult care or
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
the most extreme cases those children
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
will be staying in a facility some kind
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
of either a nursing home or some kind of
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
a facility um so
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
i just think that this is a move that
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
i had hoped to see many many years ago
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
as a special ed teacher
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
working with children with disabilities
 
00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:41.349 align:start position:0%
working with children with disabilities
my

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
caseloads would be big at a high school
 
00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:44.390 align:start position:0%
caseloads would be big at a high school
level

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
most of my students would always
 
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.150 align:start position:0%
most of my students would always
graduate

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
graduate
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
a very very small small population of
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
children would have to go stay till
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're 21
 
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
they're 21
and

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
moving on to 22 it's mostly those most
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
severe cases i believe that we are
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
within this bill
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
i mean that's my experience and then my
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
experience as as assistant
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent dealing with children
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities the same thing
 
00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
especially in residential placements so
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
so tell me why we need this study
 
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.750 align:start position:0%
so tell me why we need this study
committee

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
that was an amendment that happened
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
after the hearing so i didn't hear the
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
discussion around the study committee
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
represented do you think we need a study
 
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.790 align:start position:0%
represented do you think we need a study
committee

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
personally i don't but i there must have
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
been a reason no
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the fact is we need yeah
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the sake of a commission i think the
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
ag's office answered what the study
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee would have said yeah um and i
 
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.710 align:start position:0%
committee would have said yeah um and i
think

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
as former deputy commissioner the agg's
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
decisions were very valuable to me and i
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
didn't go through my life at all without
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
talking to their office every single day
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i would feel comfortable if we could
 
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.950 align:start position:0%
so i would feel comfortable if we could
move

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.390 align:start position:0%
move
toward

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
toward
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
doing what the ag's office has guided us
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
to and by providing relief to those
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
for those students by taking this
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
amendment as maybe we need to make some
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
changes in it yeah um i think we cover
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
the basis of keeping the school
 
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
the basis of keeping the school
districts

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
districts
whole

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
and also addressing the needs of our
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities that whatever
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
reason have really it would be in their
 
00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
best interest to remain until they're
 
00:46:31.359 --> 00:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
best interest to remain until they're
22.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of getting rid of this
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
stupid competition
 
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
stupid competition
yeah

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and the legislative members oh yeah
 
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.030 align:start position:0%
yeah and the legislative members oh yeah
four

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
three four
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
the speaker will love it
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously you would be the person
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
from doe that would be on this
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
commission do you think it's worthwhile
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
as i said i did not hear the discussion
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
around the um for the purpose of the
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
commission oh don't i would feel
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable don't evade me no i don't
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
i really don't i like i had a brief like
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
view of it i don't even really know
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
everything that it says so i i would
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
hate to say something okay i think that
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
the intention was to find out more
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
information about the older children
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
that are staying longer um but i i i'm
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
not i mean
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
you will know that when we get the um
 
00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:56.069 align:start position:0%
you will know that when we get the um
um

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
whatever they call that
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
request for funding no when we get the
 
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.870 align:start position:0%
request for funding no when we get the
uh

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
yeah the counts the student counts well
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
we'll know that
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay anyhow
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
so mickey get rid of that
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
all of it
 
00:48:18.319 --> 00:48:20.069 align:start position:0%
all of it
and

00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.150 align:start position:0%
and um
d.o.e

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
d.o.e
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
seems to think they would have
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient dollars and whatever they
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
call that
 
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.470 align:start position:0%
call that
for

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
not only that's entirely sufficient um i
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
think if you were interested in using
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
that money you would need to one talk
 
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:37.990 align:start position:0%
that money you would need to one talk
about

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
that it would need to be an allowable
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
use of this money and that we would
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
fully fund it not just use the state
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
special education aid formula to make
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
the money non-lapsing at the end of
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 because right now i believe it
 
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 because right now i believe it
lapses

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
lapses
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
and then three potentially make it
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
prorated if there's not enough money for
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
got all that mickey
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
i know caitlyn's just at the other end
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the phone line
 
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.670 align:start position:0%
of the phone line
well

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
i think i think there's a question
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
of what period you would want this to
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
so the amendment came before you
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
applying to a future fiscal year and
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
there's been discussions of making this
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
upon passage
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
making this upon passage
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
are you trying to make this apply to the
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
21-22 school year only or 22-23 or all
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
so we would need some clarity on what
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
period you would want these
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursements to apply to 22-23
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
i mean we can't
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
i know you said that you'd like it
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage so we'll let the
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
school districts pick up six months of
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh the cost and then
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state will pick up the costs for 23
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
that would take care of the remainder of
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
this budget then that's true this could
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
be part of a budget deliberation right i
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
mean you know school is only
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah may and june two months
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
and everybody gets out on the 15th of
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
june so
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
most most everybody so
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
they'll have to pick up the cost for
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
we'll put the state will pick up the
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
costs for
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
and then it'll go into the budget for
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
24 25.
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
many of them do yes so could we include
 
00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
that in this
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's typically part of their um that's
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
typically part of their special
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
education aid and their entire
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
not to mention that uh
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
there's probably
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'd hate to say how much is out there
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
esra yeah as for money
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
so the schools can certainly
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
i am just so angry
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
about how much esra money is out on the
 
00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.150 align:start position:0%
about how much esra money is out on the
table

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
that i can't stand it
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
and so every time i think about it it
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.390 align:start position:0%
and so every time i think about it it
just

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
i try not to can i say one thing about
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
that you can say anything because i also
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
we just heard our school district budget
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
the other night and i too was like irate
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
because they've only spent 10 million
 
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.589 align:start position:0%
because they've only spent 10 million
dollars

00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the problem is there
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's not a way to show in esser that
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
you were encumbering money
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming school year
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
first obligate it and spend the money
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
before you can draw it down from the doe
 
00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
before you can draw it down from the doe
right

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
so that is correct but you can show it
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
as obligated in the grants management
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
system so we have a column called
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
allocation and then we have obligation
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
and then that can go through the end of
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
the allowable period of grant which
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
is through 24 i believe so if they were
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
planning on spending money next year
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
they could show that as obligated and
 
00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:28.390 align:start position:0%
they could show that as obligated and
then

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
the drawdown means it has actually been
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
expended so we do have a large amount of
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
money that has been has not been drawn
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
down i'm not sure the amount of money
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
that has been unobligated at this so can
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
do school districts understand that they
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
should be doing that
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
i would say the answer to that is yes i
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
hope so but
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
i might be calling you up from
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
manchester again yeah come meet with us
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
again yeah but it's uh we do one of
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
those annually i know it just it just
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
drives me crazy i
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
and it's not you know what cares
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the first one was there's still
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
money in there
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair i agree with you i can't
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
tell you when i worked at the department
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
i used to beg folks at points to spend
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
their federal money in a timely fashion
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
take us forever to get through but
 
00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.230 align:start position:0%

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're just knocking this stuff out
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead so uh marty jack hillsborough
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
36 which is nashua uh i happen to be in
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:44.069 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right so 401 went through the
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee because of
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
the body worn camera
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh provisions uh i happened to be
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
subbing in the committee that day
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
and there's 66 million dollars of
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
highway funds for state aid bridge and
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
formula a that are included in the bill
 
00:57:02.079 --> 00:57:03.190 align:start position:0%
formula a that are included in the bill
also

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
the municipal association brought
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
suggested language the purpose of the
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
language is to allow towns to accept and
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
expend these funds without having to
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
have a town meeting first so that they
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
could use them in 22 and typically the
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
town will not be having another town
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
meeting until next year
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
the way this is drafted it is not
 
00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:25.839 align:start position:0%
obvious what they changed it starts on
 
00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
line seven no funds appropriated through
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
the end of that section
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then on line 16 no funds
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated through the end of that
 
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.230 align:start position:0%
appropriated through the end of that
section

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
and on line 24 the funds appropriated
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's the change
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what the municipals it
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
basically carves out an exception uh so
 
00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:44.390 align:start position:0%
basically carves out an exception uh so
that

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh towns
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
can't don't ca will will fall under 31
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
colon 95
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
and can expend the funds as
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i would i would encourage the
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
committee to adopt this yes so that they
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
can expend the funds this year right
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
transportation has another idea
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
so we basically need to change how we're
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
planning to uh send this money out
 
00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.309 align:start position:0%
planning to uh send this money out
because

00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
we don't want to mess up safety and
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
transportation but this is the um
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the 66 in um
 
00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:45.270 align:start position:0%
yeah the 66 in um
uh

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
going out
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
for bridges road repair and you had
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your email to me that you
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
thought this was a bad idea
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
because of how it's constructed um no
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
kathy mulcahy hampson on behalf of the
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
department of transportation marie
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
mullins with
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
me we're with the department's
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely thrilled
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
with 36 million dollars going to
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
we haven't spoken to the senate that
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
brought the um amendment forward in
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
terms of um their intent
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
but it it appears obvious that they want
 
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.750 align:start position:0%
but it it appears obvious that they want
um

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
funds to go to
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
the municipalities for transportation
 
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.150 align:start position:0%
the municipalities for transportation
infrastructure

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that's wonderful again the
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
department's thrilled
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
the money going into the state aid
 
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
the money going into the state aid
bridge

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.109 align:start position:0%
bridge
program

00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:44.630 align:start position:0%
program
is

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
a little more involved
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the department had received federal
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
funds through the iija
 
00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:52.950 align:start position:0%
funds through the iija
and

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
those funds had a certain formula so
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
there's currently 6.7 or 6.8 million a
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
year that goes to state aid bridge with
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
the iija funds
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
that program doubled
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
coincidentally with the formulas the
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
feds had put out it's another 6.7 or 6.8
 
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.589 align:start position:0%
feds had put out it's another 6.7 or 6.8
million

01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
so state aid bridge program has doubled
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
the 36 million additional under this
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
amendment going into state aid bridge we
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
just want
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
the the committee to understand the
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
process that's involved with state aid
 
01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:27.589 align:start position:0%
process that's involved with state aid
bridge

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
and it's um
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work it's it's time
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
consuming and the program's just doubled
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
so we're doing that work so can i can i
 
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
so we're doing that work so can i can i
just

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
can we just
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
distribute the money
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
based on whatever form don't shake your
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
head back there
 
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.230 align:start position:0%
head back there
just

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
just based on
 
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
without going through
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
the bridge thing and tell the
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
communities that it's for bridgework
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes that would be more expeditious but
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a formula so much for the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
state aid bridge like there is for block
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
grant aid state aid bridge is a first
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
come first served they apply for it um
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
so but they're um if you took the block
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
grant aid formula or based on the number
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
of bridges in that community and did a
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
different type of formula um we just
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in and apprise the the
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
committee of the process that's involved
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
with state aid bridge and
 
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
with state aid bridge and
um

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's a year or more from the time we
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
solicit projects until they're selected
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's an agreement with the
 
01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:39.349 align:start position:0%
and then there's an agreement with the
municipality

01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to get the funds out more
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
expeditiously to the towns
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
then that would be directing the funds
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
right to the towns and not through the
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
state aid bridge we love funds going to
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
the municipalities for transportation
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bridge bridges roads um
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful we just wanted the
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
committee to to realize that it's not
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
going out as quickly as the legislature
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
might want it to if it's in the state
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
okay senator senator what
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative graham
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
said i wouldn't see
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
wherever yeah
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
just so that because we're on
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
whatever work session um and we'll also
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
be it
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
the options that i see based on what
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
your questions were is you take the
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
whole 66 million and turn it into
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
um an apportionment out to the towns or
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
you leave
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
leave it in state bridge aid which then
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
specifies it's got to be
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
used for bridges and it is a process and
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
cost sharing process with the towns as
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
as i think everybody here knows
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
so but if you just do it a straight
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
apportionment they can use it on any
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
kind of maintenance and work and
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
everything else on their their roads and
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many of them can turn
 
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how many of them can turn
out

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
that much more money in
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
as long as we can make it non-lapsing to
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
in their town or city budget
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
that would have to be worked out i i
 
01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:24.470 align:start position:0%
that would have to be worked out i i
just

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
would think that it might be better to
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
leave it as state bridge aid so that
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
towns can
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay we have to have our match
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
and then there is this additional money
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
of 36 million that we can come forward
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.029 align:start position:0%
and then the
the

01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
department can prioritize who's come in
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
which which bridges are actually
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
eligible because some of them aren't and
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
the federal money
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
really complicated the whole issue
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
because not every
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
municipal bridge it meets the criteria
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
to use the federal money because of the
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
length of the bridges
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
we got a tutorial on that
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
public works but it it
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
that's why there was a long list of
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
different bridges and funding and and
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
what we passed in in the 10-year
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
transportation i think i think the goal
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
was to get the money out quickly
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay and not to spend
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
in trying to um
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
fiddle with the bureaucracy
 
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:40.510 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
of um
[Music]

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
transportation i mean
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i understand why why we we all
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
understand why i i just think that
 
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.630 align:start position:0%
understand why i i just think that
um

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
how do you make
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
if we give say bedford another one point
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
whatever million which would would be if
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
we we got uh the full apportionment
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
we may not be able to do all that work
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
this year with that money
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
the town can do it themselves okay um
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
then that might be a way
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
um to do it rather than bridges um
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
although there is a long list and i
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it with me about this stick
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
of municipal red listed bridges right
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
but she's got it
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
but but we i mean
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
i guess my point is i don't care where
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
they spend the money
 
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:36.390 align:start position:0%
they spend the money
but

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah no i mean i mean as long as it's
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure yeah but but the
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
problem is with bridges
 
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.029 align:start position:0%
problem is with bridges
um

01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
if the state's gonna pick up
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh 80 percent uh
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the bridge then
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
coming up with a 20 match is better than
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
spending 2 million
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
on a bridge in town okay i mean and
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at from i know what's going
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
on in bedford and i know
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
um what goes on across
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
the others
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
so what we would have to say
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
to the towns is that this money can only
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
be used for
 
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.789 align:start position:0%
be used for
road

01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
repair construction
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
whatever i don't know what the right
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
words are
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no because infrastructure there's
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
words in the apportionment uh
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
statute right now on what it can be used
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
for you you can use that but it doesn't
 
01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.549 align:start position:0%
for you you can use that but it doesn't
get

01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
as she just held up this 200 and some
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
red listed municipal bridges that
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't get taken care of if we don't
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
keep putting money towards them well
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
i mean if i may we could put you know we
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
could come up with some ideas not on
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
tuesday at the public hearing like some
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
other alternatives there's no public
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
hearing oh there's no public hearing no
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay we're not having a public hearing
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have another work session
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
just like this okay well at the next
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
work session um we could come up with
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
some other ideas but there's there's
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
always you know you could direct it as
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
you say towards bridges to the
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
communities and then they could provide
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
a letter of intent to the department of
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
what bridge or what projects they intend
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
to use it on so that we can assure that
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's going towards bridges
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
there might be some different options
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we could bring some different ideas
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
if you want to get it you know
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
spent expeditiously
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
and give that freedom to the towns to be
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
able to determine what bridge they would
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
like to prioritize and that type of
 
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.270 align:start position:0%
like to prioritize and that type of
thing

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead john just um i'm sorry but
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
represent if you're going it's john
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
but if you're going to do that
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
how do you portion it out to all 200
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that that everybody gets
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
the because there's only we're only
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
talking 36 million which doesn't do a
 
01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
lot of bridges um so would it be still
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
first come first served or if i got it
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
would be on an allocation basis so if i
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
got square footage of bridges in each
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
that but we could just use it specific
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
to bridge the allocation of bridges in
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then each town would get their fair
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
share related to the number or size of
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
bridges that they have
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then that would guarantee all the
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
towns get money directed to them
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
towns have yes so go ahead
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
and fourteen already say that it's not
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
lasting yeah
 
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
lasting yeah
yeah

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
well it's yeah right that's that's at
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
the state level that's not we have to
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
direct the towns that they can't just
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
put it into their rainy day fund and
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh the question still would have to be
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
answered if we do an apportionment on
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
bridges do the towns and cities still
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to come up with their
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
match under the under the rsa for state
 
01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.709 align:start position:0%
match under the under the rsa for state
bridge

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
01:09:08.719 --> 01:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
bridge
um

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
aid are we just going to say here's this
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
go out and
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
first come first ser well whatever you
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
can spend 100 on this one bridge um to
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
and that language would have to be in
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
there if you're not going to have them
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
do a match to it
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah if it's and you could make it
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
so it's not part of the state bridge aid
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
program rsa it could be a separate
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
allocation law you know that gets passed
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
specifically for this instance not
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
related to the state bridge aid program
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the rules and that type of thing
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
but that i mean like but like kathy said
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know that's up to the legislature
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
and the policy what you want to set
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do the department
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
will follow through if you want to go
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
through the state of bridge program
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
we'll do that um
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we you know we wanted to just let
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know that process how long it takes
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
and let's let's come up with a
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
new policy for this money for bridges
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay so it doesn't have to flow through
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
the state aid bridge thing
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
it just says that we're going to
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
allocate it equitably or whatever
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
and you have to tell us what bridges
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to fix
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
is that right and
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
but anyhow you'll come back
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
on yeah we can come back tuesday tuesday
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
but again we haven't spoken i i'm sorry
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't spoken with the senate yet so
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
we weren't sure what their intent was
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't worry about the senate i'll take
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
care of them
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't tell them we said it was a bad
 
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
don't tell them we said it was a bad
idea

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:40.730 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
idea
[Laughter]

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
i think following up on uh the chairs
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
comments i i i would like to
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
specifically make sure it goes to
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
bridges i don't want block grants to
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
towns when somebody decides hey hey
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
let's put in a new road over here you
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
know let's take care of the red listed
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
bridges how you allocate that you know
 
01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.470 align:start position:0%
bridges how you allocate that you know
but

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
you guys can best decide that but i
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be the burgess
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
well madam chair we you're still just
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
looking at that 36 million that says for
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
bridges and because there's still
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
another 30 million which would go out
 
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
another 30 million which would go out
for

01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
all road
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
repair maintenance and and the rest
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
under under the current rsa yes that's
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct okay but we just
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that even in there
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we say
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
it has to be used for roads
 
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.790 align:start position:0%
it has to be used for roads
and

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
keep it for
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
however long you need until you spend
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
the last penny
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you don't have any problem with that
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
no that's that's how the law the block
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
grant law reads now so okay yep just
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
those block those requirements are in
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
the law right now so
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else that you
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
we love money going to transportation
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
and historically
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're very supportive of going we really
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
now we have structured the legislature
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing the need
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's tremendous
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
one thing i would caution on is we talk
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
about the redless bridges and we
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to punish towns that have
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
been diligent in right
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
preserving their bridges and doing that
 
01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
work so that's why we you know think an
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
allocation a fair allocation to all
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
communities based on the number of
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
bridges or square footage would be the
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
most equitable rather than targeting it
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
specifically a red list so
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
and madam chair i would still suggest
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
that under the apportionment a
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
distributions that we include the
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
language that says they can go ahead and
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
start spending it
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
when the when it becomes effective
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for our next town
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
meeting to say oh yeah okay
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely you can the day you get it
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the selectmen accept it and
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
or the council association asks for that
 
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.310 align:start position:0%
or the council association asks for that
yeah

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's didn't get
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's in here
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.030 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
my clerk wants your names
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%

not be present today it was quick notice
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%

yeah

01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%

unless you're unless you're interested
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
we're not on um we're not for the um
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
dash cameras for the inventory fund
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's for the million dollars that's
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
for local law enforcement but we do have
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
section four in the
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
that was added to the bill for
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
authorizing the department of
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
transportation to operate dash cameras
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
oh these are your fleet vehicles yes
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
oh that's paragraph four yes
 
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.870 align:start position:0%
oh that's paragraph four yes
okay

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.790 align:start position:0%
sure
um

01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
on that i do have um a couple of
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
handouts with with pictures
 
01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
handouts with with pictures
um

01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
the department's seeking the
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
authorization to operate the cameras
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
because under this law is prohibiting
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance on on the highways so
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
we were specifically asking for
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
authorization for this
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
the reason is one for safety so that
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
the traveling public and our employees
 
01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.630 align:start position:0%
the traveling public and our employees
are

01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
more protected by these cameras
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
and secondly
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
as as marie can testify to we do have
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
some issues collecting for damages
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
caused to our vehicles
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
drivers strike the vehicles and take off
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have any informational plate
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
information we can't identify them
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
it would help one to know what happened
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
and two to be able to identify the
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle in the plate so we can actually
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
collect damages when the vehicles are
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
totaled the ones i gave you um are two
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the 25 that have been struck since
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
january of this year um they're safety
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
patrol vehicles so we have a d.o.t
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
employee out on the road in these safety
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
patrol vehicles and they pull over to
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
help motorists in need and they're out
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle and um
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
one that was struck is going to be
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
totaled that was the level of damage to
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a big safety issue for the
 
01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.709 align:start position:0%
so it's a big safety issue for the
department

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
did you want to add to that marie with
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
the claims
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it it helps us get the claim
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
some people drive off but i mean
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
primarily the the safety
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
many of you may have seen last month i
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
think that probably that first picture
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
on mur they had the video
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
luckily our employee was in he was in
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
the vehicle but was not injured um and
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
so but having that dash cam we were able
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
to identify the vehicle that struck um
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the employee and thankfully no one
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
was hurt but
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
i know the state police have the same
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
issue but the
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
um it's a very bad you know safety issue
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure our employees are
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
are protected and that we can collect
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
for any damages i think in that video he
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
had his own camera on it yeah he had his
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
other

01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
other
questions

01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead how does that uh balance
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
out with uh you know say
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh videos that you can't use on the
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
highway supposedly
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is a
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
your freedom to
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
in other words what are they what are
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
you going to use the information for is
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
it going to be deleted after a certain
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
amount of time i mean we we don't want
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
this used for
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think it provides that there's no
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
incident um
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's been recorded it would be deleted
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
after i think it's three days it's
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
provided um and otherwise it's over if
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
if there's an incident and someone
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
requests it or the department needs it
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
we would keep it at the transportation
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
management center which is secured
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's not put out on a public site or
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it says
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
acceptance otherwise provided no video
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
recording shall be stored longer than
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
three business days
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
so you're in age
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
and a request would be required within
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
that three days by state police or
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else that needs it for
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
an incident otherwise it gets deleted
 
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.709 align:start position:0%
an incident otherwise it gets deleted
and

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
there would be no nothing kept at the
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
tmc after that point
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh something
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
you can't understand that you know this
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
can be used for nefarious purposes as
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
far as the you know who whoever i mean
 
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:19.189 align:start position:0%
far as the you know who whoever i mean
it's

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want to be under 1984.
 
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want to be under 1984.
circumstance

01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know and it's uh that that would
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
bother me but i i can understand your
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
point where
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact i'm thinking of putting
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
one in i had a couple incidents myself
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
where you know i didn't uh
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
i matter of fact you have to eat those
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
costs sometimes because you don't have
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
any proof and that and course cameras
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
are obviously improved so
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's follow-up and representative
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
petrie's issue this was the
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
subject to debate on the house floor
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday this particular
 
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.910 align:start position:0%
yesterday this particular
issue

01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
incidences and i guess we could go into
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
a long line of questioning on what
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
defines an incident you know we talk in
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
incidents that apply to a d.o.t truck
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
does it imply to a
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
d.o.t individual who's outside his truck
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
going down representative petrie's road
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
i mean does it uh if the
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
the truck happens to capture
 
01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.470 align:start position:0%
the truck happens to capture
a

01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh citizen doing something can the state
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
police then say hey we want to
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
requisition that video and you you see
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
where some people correct let's go with
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
this i i understand um from our director
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
of operations that the um quality of the
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
video isn't the best um so it would be
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
something in close close proximity to
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
the truck that would be captured a
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle striking it or a situation with
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
a person on the side of the road or our
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
employee it's not a whole
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
big wide area that's being captured it's
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
more would essentially what the driver
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
seen from behind the wheel but i'm not
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
just so you where there are there are
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
concerns out there about this yes
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
again that the
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
the film would be kept for no more than
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
three days unless there's a request um
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
for a legal purpose such as a need for
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
it in court um
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
that the department needs to make a
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
claim against someone for damage to the
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're too busy a department to keep tabs
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
i uh i would hope so
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
so uh steve did you want to come and
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
talk about this other
 
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
talk about this other
one

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
um steve lavoy i'm the director of
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
administration uh from the department of
 
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.510 align:start position:0%
administration uh from the department of
safety

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
the million dollar appropriation is
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
to fund the existing body and dashboard
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
camera grant program
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
for for locals
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to implement dashboard
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
cameras in their communities and so this
 
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
cameras in their communities and so this
was

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
established through
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
through the last budget process in house
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill 2 a million dollars was
 
01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.830 align:start position:0%
bill 2 a million dollars was
appropriated

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
the program was released we had 29
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
applicants come through the first
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
the first program um over 700 and i want
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
to say 750 760 000
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
was awarded
 
01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.310 align:start position:0%
was awarded
um

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we have about a hundred and fifteen
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
thousand or so left in in that fund so
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
this would allow us to go through and
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
offer a second pass for those
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
communities that weren't able to apply
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh due to timing due to timing within
 
01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.310 align:start position:0%
uh due to timing due to timing within
their

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
their process and i do see that there's
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
some language added here to address the
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the local process acceptance of the
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
funds too
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
that you might have about the grant
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
program itself
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
or anything else related to it but it is
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
a program that we at the department
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
administer these funds we don't receive
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
them this is just passing those funds on
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
to the locals based on their
 
01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:18.229 align:start position:0%
to the locals based on their
applications

01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
you probably said it and i probably
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
missed it is the current fund already
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
totally wiped out
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
we have about
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
120 000 dollars
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh left okay thank you
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
how many went out do you know how many
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
dash cams
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know the total number of cameras
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
there were 29 there were 29 communities
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
who received funding okay and it varies
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
i mean some were very small where
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
there's only a handful and there's some
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
that were that were larger
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay and what's nice about the program
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
is it's it allows the community to
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
choose whichever model
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
will fit for them
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different approaches
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
with body cameras you can
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
go with a hosted solution and lease the
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
equipment you can buy the equipment and
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
keep your servers on site
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know the the grant program itself is
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
silent whichever options work for the
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we did it in two mm-hmm
 
01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.350 align:start position:0%
yeah we did it in two mm-hmm
yeah

01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
and we were hoping that
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
it would be taken up
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i would like to say in those
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
discussions we had requested a position
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
to help us administer it um that
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
position is filled that's the only
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
reason we were able to really get this
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
out timely and um based on our
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
assessment we we don't need any
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
additional um staff support for the
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
for this for this million dollar amount
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
if the amount changed we might have a
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
different discussion
 
01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:55.669 align:start position:0%
different discussion
well

01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
that was a temporary position right
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
correct yeah
 
01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:00.790 align:start position:0%
correct yeah
okay

01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on 401 any
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
