good morning everyone the time being uh
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
9 past 10:00 we'll get going I hope you
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
all have had a good summer and um this
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh should be our last Ways and Means
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
meeting I know the last one I said it
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
was our last one but I had forgotten
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
about the interim study bills
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
so here we are to dispatch those
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to what I'm going to do
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
to start with I'm going to open a work
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
session on all three um School related
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
bills the 56 HB 569 hb514 HB
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
1563 I just want to open a work session
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
on all three of those at once and kind
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
of discuss in general uh part of the
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
issue is the Supreme Court still has not
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
made it decision um I checked with the
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
um uh with the Attorney General's office
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh through Jennifer 4 and um we tried to
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
get is anyone here from the Attorney
 
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.310 align:start position:0%
get is anyone here from the Attorney
General's

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
General's
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
office or or
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
doj okay um they were not able to send
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
someone in but basically there's
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing new from the last time
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
we got an update we still don't have any
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
decisions so I kind of just want to um
 
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
just see where people are with these
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
things um because today um since we are
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
working on interim study bills we each
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill is going to be either um
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation or
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
so let's start with that representative
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
PL yes I'm going to be a broken record
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
today because I think we should not
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
recommend all of them including the
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
three School ones and the reason for the
 
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
three School ones is because the court
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't acted and we'll have to I think
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
we should wait for the court to act and
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
then and then uh put legislation
 
00:11:09.079 --> 00:11:11.310 align:start position:0%
then and then uh put legislation
together

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
together
accordingly

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative spillsbury
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'd like to
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
take the opposite view on that
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
um yes we've put these in interim study
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and we're still waiting two decisions
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Supreme Court in
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
the Rand case in the conval case and we
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
probably uh won't have seen those
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
decisions when the legislative uh the
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
LSR window opens and closes in November
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
so it's worthwhile to talk for a few
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
minutes about what kind of Bill or bills
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
we would like to see before the
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
committee so that if and when this opens
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
up we have something to work with um I
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh there's Merit in seeing something
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
along the lines of
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
both uh 1514 and
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
1563 1514 is representative beckford's
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill that is very simple and
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
straightforward because it restores the
 
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
language that had been repealed by the
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
legislature in
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
2011 so that those
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have so-called
 
00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
excess swept would have to remit that to
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
the state going to the education trust
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
fund and would be available for
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
redistribution 1563 on the other hand uh
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
completely repeals swept and replaces it
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
with a different approach that's more
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
consistent with a major bill that the
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
education committee has in in interim
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
study David Luna's bill I believe was um
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
1583 will almost certainly uh be
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
reintroduced in in very similar format
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
is meeting on October 3rd they have
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
about uh 25 interim study bills that
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
includes David lunos and it also
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
includes another uh swep bill so we've
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
got this confusion we've talked about
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
before where uh essentially the same
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
subject matter is being handled in ways
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
and means and in education uh with some
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and some overlapping
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
approaches we're going to need to
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
discuss this next year we should have a
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
bill or two that give us some choices in
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
a foundation for discussion and I think
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
those two bills do a pretty good job of
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
James I agree with representative
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
spillsbury I I believe that um the
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
subject matter that these bills address
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
require um
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and and that's really what
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh is this uh does
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
this issue that's addressed by this
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh such that it warrants
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
future legislation it's not not saying
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
what the legislation will be um but it's
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
saying yeah there's something here that
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh based on what we know
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
is likely to require us to uh you know
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
roll up our sleeves and figure out
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
something and in this case we're
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
handicapped today uh by um the
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of the uh uh law as it
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
applies to swept and as it applies to
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
the whole school funding formula for
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
that matter um and
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
uh it we don't know when the Supreme
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
Court will finally issue a decision just
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
adding a little bit of detail to the
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
status right now
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the uh briefing period
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
for um the parties in this case and for
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
Miki for that matter um closes at the
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
end of this roughly the end of this
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
month maybe a day or two into October
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of that and um and once
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is done the court will schedule
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
oral argument I'm sure they will take or
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
oral argument on this uh these cases the
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
two cases one one is directly swept and
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
the other is uh is the amount of the the
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
sufficiency of the adequacy costing
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
formula and Grant
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
formula um and uh you know they'll come
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
out with a decision when they come out
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
with it and then
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh one could say almost with certainty
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh that the legislature is going to have
 
00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759 align:start position:0%
to get involved um not for certain
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
because who knows uh but uh likely and
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh so these
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
bills all represent good faith efforts
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
to try to um take steps down that new
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
road and um we're on pause as to how to
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
deal with them I think we should uh not
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
say no no future legislation is needed
 
00:16:23.309 --> 00:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
and the other option is say yes future
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed I favor this the
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you I agree with the
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
previous two speakers um I think um
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
really we need to be planning ahead just
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
in case um a lot of the weight will fall
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
on this Committee in one way or another
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
depending on the decision so I think to
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
already start doing some creative
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
thinking and you know have some type of
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
plans going forward really is the best
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
choice thank you uh representative ORS
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I agree with both
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
sides on this I also believe that until
 
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court makes the decision
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
we're not really going
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere however I believe we should do
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
a Bottoms Up approach I mean this is
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
like so convoluted rip the Band-Aid off
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
and let's start the healing build it
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
from the bottom up and let's get it
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you just to add something
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
about the time schedule uh the last time
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
we had this problem on it was
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
1998 and the Supreme Court uh issued its
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
decision on I think it was three weeks
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh one week into
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
December and then uh we all arrived and
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
the finance committee had absorbed the
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee which in some
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
ways worked better and in some ways
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
worked worse
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
um but on we um the Supreme Court
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
realizes is that if they say something
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
that is going to require
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
legislation they they should they knew
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
and they should know now that they will
 
00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:22.039 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision uh in December
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
latest so that we will have time to try
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with it
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you represented
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you I I just want I I
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that having a couple of
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
options readily available next year
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
because they've been filed this build is
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
is a good idea because we are going to
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
have to deal with this and I just wanted
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.310 align:start position:0%
 
fif

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
fif
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
1563 that um I did an extensive amount
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
of work with
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
Dr to add some Provisions that deal with
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
really um
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
detailed issues related to the
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
transition if you were to get rid of
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
swep how do you go from having it to get
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
to getting rid of it in terms of how the
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities will will send out their
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
tax bills and calculate their
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
anticipated semiannual or quarter
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
quarter annual bills so so um I'm
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
confident that that has addressed all
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
the technical issues so I think that
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
that um you know that will be an
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
improvement over what we looked at and
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
will be a good option to present have
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
available thank
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
you representative PL animating what I
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
stated is that this is total waste of
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
time because whether we recommend or not
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
recommend it does not bind a future
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
legislature either way so let the future
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislature decide what bills are needed
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
topic okay seeing none I will close the
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
work session
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now we'll go back to the
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh calendar here and uh I will open the
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
work session on
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
hb5 relative to the rate of the business
 
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.950 align:start position:0%
hb5 relative to the rate of the business
Enterprise

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
tax any discussion on
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
that representative PL again any any uh
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation or non- reccommendation
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
it does not bind a future
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislature I would leave it to a future
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislature take it to take a fresh look
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
at revenues and then decide whether tax
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
cuts or tax increases or should be on
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
the table or not but this legislature
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
should just let the future legislature
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
worry about it so I that's why I'm
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
recommending not not recommending not
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
recommending all of these
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
bills including this one okay so uh
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
basically all bills I don't need
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
recognize you now cuz I know what you're
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
say is that true I've been gone a couple
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
of weeks you still know who I am you're
 
00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:37.950 align:start position:0%
of weeks you still know who I am you're
recognizing

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you thank you uh rep
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative elme yes on I realize
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
that this is kind of a
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
charade since it doesn't obligate any
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
future legislature it gives some kind of
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
indication however about what we're
 
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.830 align:start position:0%
indication however about what we're
thinking

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
about so I would like to to vote on
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
these rather than just say none of it
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
matters which it does really we we will
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
be voting I think uh to representative
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
pl's point he's just saying they should
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
all be not recommended is that correct
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct it it's in the future
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislature will decide what's important
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
and what's not okay thank you yes
 
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative fellas I would just like
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
to to speak to that concept of let the
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
next term decide what they want to do um
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't recommend it is not
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
saying we leave it up to you because our
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
two two choices are to
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that it do be that it becomes
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
or or there should be
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
legislation on this topic next year or
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
there should not be legislation on this
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
topic next year and the only way that we
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
would be saying we leave it up to you is
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
if we come out with a
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
tie in in this committee and in which
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
case we're going to make the the case
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
for recommending it or not recommending
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
it so we that's not really an option
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
leave it up to
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
them to your point if it's so that's one
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
thing I didn't mention for those who are
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
unsure if a vote ends up in a tie it
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
will come out without recommendation so
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
there's really three cases right
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
recommended not recommended and um
 
00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:36.230 align:start position:0%
recommended not recommended and um
without

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation represent
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I don't think we can talk about
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
leave it up to then because the law
 
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.870 align:start position:0%
leave it up to then because the law
requires

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
that they can make up their own minds no
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
matter what we
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
do right I mean to yeah I mean I think
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
on on if there's ones that we feel
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
passionate about that that we feel like
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
we wish they passed or some form of them
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
passed then saying we recommend it for
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
future legislation does indicate um the
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
thought of the committee so um so I
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
think to representative pl's Point yes
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
nothing the future legislature is not
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
bound to anything they don't have to
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
take any of these recommendations but we
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
as a as a committee still can make our
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
15 okay close the work session on
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
hp15 and I will open the work session on
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
HP 100 which is to repeal the interest
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
and dividends tax and
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure everyone knows this is
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
already passed and been signed by the
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
governor um so uh in my mind this is
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
probably not recommended because it's
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
already passed um so if there's anyone
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
else who feels differently uh
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
please indicate they want to
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
speak okay seeing none I will close the
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
hp100 I'll open the work session HP 133
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
relative to repealing the communication
 
00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
relative to repealing the communication
Services

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
tax and look for any any thoughts on
 
00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
that representative PL I know where you
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
sitting I should say I know how you're
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
thinking uh yes representative duet yeah
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
I think I think we heard a lot of
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and it it's something that
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
that uh not withstanding the argument
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
that was just made at the beginning of
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
this something that deserves to be
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
explored you know with with what we
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
heard uh in committee so i' I'd want to
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
see some future uh legislation relative
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
to Communications tax okay thank you
 
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.630 align:start position:0%
to Communications tax okay thank you
representative

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
elme yes I think it's probably the least
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
defensible tax at this point however um
 
00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.029 align:start position:0%
defensible tax at this point however um
we

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
have on repealed an enormous amount of
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
the revenue of the state the base
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
revenue of the state and since since
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
2016 and I would vote against any
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
attempt to repeal more until we deal
 
00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:41.669 align:start position:0%
attempt to repeal more until we deal
with

00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
that okay seeing no other comments I
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
will close the work session on HP
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
133 now open the work session on hp1
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
1422 relative to the rates of the
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
business profits tax business Enterprise
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
tax Communications Services tax and
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax representative
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
ducet yeah and in the spirit of uh
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
rapidity here I think these are a bunch
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
of stuff that was put together um and we
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
see this come across you pretty much
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
every banum I think uh we do not
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
recommend this for further legislation
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
that these components can be broken down
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
into individual legislation and
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
addressed as it should be
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
individually thank
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh yes I agree and we did
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
discuss the possible um needs of the uh
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
education lawsuit which may be coming
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
our way but I'd also like to bring up U
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
my concern which is the needs um for the
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
child assault
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um I've read a variety of
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
Articles it just seems to be getting
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger uh what these amounts
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be so I just think we have
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
to proceed with caution for our
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
committee's uh side of things because I
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
saw one thing that said 75 million a
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
year for 10 years and all these
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
different things are being put out um
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to be quite a burden on the
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
state which I think it's going to be
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
comments okay seeing none we I will
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
close the work session on HB
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
1422 now open the work session HP
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
1492 and um yes representative du
 
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
Set uh again I I think this has already
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
been addressed with a piece of
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
legislation uh so we have no need
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
to proceed with
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
this represent Aly I figured you might
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
have a comment yes
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
on on relative to my previous comment
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
that we've already cost us a great deal
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
of money and represent of southworth's
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
reminded to us of the on sonunu center
 
00:29:12.679 --> 00:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
reminded to us of the on sonunu center
problems

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
um getting rid of this particular tax is
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
um both unconstitutional as far as I'm
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
concerned because it's the
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
only burden put on people people who are
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
wealthy and are not running
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state and so they are
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
not paying state
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
tax um and um the other one is that we
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
really are going to need as much money
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
as we can find and this one is the
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
quickest turn around I well it may not
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
be we'll
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
see but I think we're going to have to
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
turn taxes around next
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
year representative
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
duet again uh I'll stick with my
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
previous comment it it's excuse me can't
 
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
previous comment it it's excuse me can't
I'm

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I've never had that problem
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
before um in effect this this uh income
 
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
tax has been phased out and you know the
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
argument could be made on both sides
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the necessity of this tax
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm a firm believer that New
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has no income tax and this was
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the final component
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
of an income tax no matter who that
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
person is a retired person living on the
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
the uh dividends from their hard work or
 
00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody else so I would not be
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of recommending we have
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that addresses this and it
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative spilburg if I may
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
ask representative Aly I'm not sure I
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
caught what you were saying did you
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
indicate you think there's a
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem with having
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
repealed interest in dividends we have
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
in our constitution in the Bill of
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
Rights section that every
 
00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
citizen should share the burden of
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh the government that supports
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
them and that's a modern interpretation
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
of that wording um and the people
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
who especially the ones who move into
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
this state because we don't have an
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
income tax um think on our not having to
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
pay towards state taxes
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
it maybe a ensy little bit for
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax and when they
 
00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.039 align:start position:0%
go out to
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
dinner um but everybody else has to pay
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
that too so it's obviously not an equal
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
burden in any sense and the
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
other um part is yes you have repealed
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
it as an income
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
tax but you have
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
it it was on our books and being paid
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
for a hundred
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
years so
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
um people are used to
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
it on the way this bill would change
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
things is to Triple exemptions so that
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh we would get back to a place where
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
the people who would be paying it would
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
be the people that couldn't afford to
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
pay it
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh wouldn't the I don't know if I had
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
that right but anyway um that the ones
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
who can't afford to pay it wouldn't be
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
paying it which is also in line with our
 
00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:11.310 align:start position:0%
paying it which is also in line with our
constitutional

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
principles um and
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
um on I believe that it is one of the
 
00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
easiest ways administratively aside from
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
putting up
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
rates uh
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
to start
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
retrieving the money that we have lost
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
that caused
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
reductions in uh in the services going
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
to municipalities who then have to turn
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair brief reply yes yeah um
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't hear anything there
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
would constitute a constitutional
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
problem um I can't imagine that the
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
repeal or the failure to tax something
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
is a constitutional problem so I I agree
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
with uh representative ducet that In The
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
Same Spirit uh with HP 100 the
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
legislator thrashed this through pretty
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
thoroughly and we don't need to do it
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
okay any other points on this okay
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll close the work session
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
on hp1
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
1492 uh that concludes all the work
 
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.030 align:start position:0%
1492 uh that concludes all the work
session

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
work um before we open the exec session
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%

represent As I understood representative
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
duet's U motion this was relative to the
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
rate I didn't say whether it was going
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
to be increased or decreased thank
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
you interesting
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
point uh yes
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair uh at
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the risk of uh being the one who points
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
out or having been told I have a keen
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
grasp of the obvious it's important to
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that not making a decision is
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
making a decision it means that we are
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
deciding to keep the current status so
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
um let's be clear that not making a
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
decision to make something different
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
means that we are making a decision to
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
keep what we have thank
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I would just like to point out
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
that the bill itself
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
clearly uh speaks to reducing the rate
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
um if there's uh nothing else I'm going
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
to close the exact session on
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
hp15 and I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
role as as soon as we give him a chance
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury yes um so I
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
think that uh as our work session
 
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
indicated we have three good alternative
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
Avenues to addressing swept we should
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
encourage that all three of these ideas
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
be preserved and brought forward again
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
next uh term so uh In The Same Spirit as
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
we take up 514 and 15 1514 and
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
1563 um I would hope we would vote um
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
recommend similarly to all three of them
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
and we can then uh wait and see and
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
frankly if the court hasn't decided by
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
the time we're going through these in
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the winter uh we can
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%

01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury has has just
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
said and and note perhaps it's important
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
to note that this is a very significant
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
subject matter that's being addressed by
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
these bills and we uh will all need to
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh roll up our sleeves and uh work to
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
find the best possible solution as we go
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
forward but it definitely needs uh
 
01:09:45.759 --> 01:09:46.749 align:start position:0%
forward but it definitely needs uh

it okay that concludes our exec session
 
01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
now I want everyone to note that there
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
there is one other bill hb14
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
29 that uh when I had done a search
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
about a month ago to see what interim
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
study bills were left that did not come
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
up um
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
and but hb14 so in theory we would need
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
a a meeting on that but um I've talked
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
to the clerk um there was a Senate bill
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
that pass it was it was a bill dealing
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
with dams the Senate bill was very
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
similar that's why we put it in interim
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
study to see how the Senate bill would
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
work out Senate bill passed um and the
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
house passed that version of it so there
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
really uh in my mind no need to come
 
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
back for a another meeting to address
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
this um if we don't come back and meet
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
about it it'll go on as without
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation but given that it's
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
already passed in its Senate form I
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
don't see any need to do that is there
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
anyone that
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
firmly and um disagrees with that and
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
and wants to come back and talk about
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
this or we all good that this will go
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
I see a thumbs up okay good um I kind of
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
figured that's the way it might go all
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you all we I will
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
tell the clerk that we're going to go
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
without recommendation for that um and
 
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative PL Mr chair I
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
chose not to run again uh and so this is
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
my last session with Ways and Means or
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
any other committee for that matter I
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
just want to say the last few two years
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
has been extremely enjoyable I learned a
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
lot and I appreciated the mostly
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan approach of ways and means
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll miss it but uh I chose not
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
to run due to age and health conditions
 
01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
and I I've been swamped beyond belief so
 
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
I have to slow down somewhere thank you
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative pl we really
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I think we'll give you
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
applause is there anyone else on the
 
01:16:55.950 --> 01:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
committee that uh did not run um or
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
um yes I ran but um I'm wondering who a
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative PL might reign as the
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
next uh dadjoke
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
person it's your
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
choice all right well uh thank you
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
everyone this uh concludes our last
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
meeting of uh this terms ways and means
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate um all your work and
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
