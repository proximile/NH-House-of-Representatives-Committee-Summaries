municipalities we'll open up the hearing
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
on that and I see Senator gray here to
 
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh my name is
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
James Gray I am uh senator from District
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
Six which starts up in Alton Gilton
 
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
comes down Route 11 to
 
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh the bill in front of you
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
63 uh has a story uh it did not start
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
off with the bill that you see in front
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
of you uh in fact that bill its Origins
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
was a house bill uh 15
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
before uh and uh I needed a house bill
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
to put uh uh the new voting machine
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
language uh on uh such that they take
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
taking out the language that is specific
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
to the acote machines uh which you guys
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
have already dealt with uh so I put that
 
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
language from House Bill 154 into uh
 
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 63 because I believe it
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
hadn't Mar
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
um I did not uh agree with the way it
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
was done there and have uh suggested
 
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
several changes as we've gone along
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
originally I put in the words that it
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
the condition uh that Health officer
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
could regulate had to be unique uh to
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
the uh town uh for them to work on and
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh there was push back from the health
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
officers and other people about that
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that the bill that you see that was
 
00:08:06.149 --> 00:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate uh went through a
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
quite a uh um several iterations of uh
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
negotiations between uh the Senate and
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
the health Officers
 
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
Association uh all in trying to get us
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
to where uh we were trying to do uh get
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
to uh and that the health officers be
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
limited to the original intent
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
is that they would be able to deal with
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
nuisances in their
 
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.190 align:start position:0%
nuisances in their
communities

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
um right now uh the words are nuisances
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
and other similar okay and that was
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
again very
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
um painfully I'm going to say uh
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the health officers to
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
get the people on board so that they
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
could deal with this uh the concept of
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
nuisances as the attorneys tell me is
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
well defined in law uh so adding
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
additional language as I've seen in an
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that may be proposed uh later
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh is not necessary uh it will not by
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
defining it as a nuisance as another
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
similar it will not let them put in Mas
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
mandates you know in a pandemic it will
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
not uh require be able to require um
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
people to get vaccinations it will not
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
allow them uh as Atkinson tried to do in
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony provided by the
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative during the Senate hearing
 
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
allow them to restrict tattooing only to
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
licens Physicians and if I go way back
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh it will not allow them to ban liquor
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh or ban smoking or ban anything else
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
because those would not come under the
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
nuisances uh so again I like the way
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
that the bill is written right now I can
 
00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
support the way the bill is written
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
right now and uh I hope that you will
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
see uh the wisdom in what the Senate has
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
done and pass the bill as it's presented
 
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
done and pass the bill as it's presented
to

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony uh
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Brown could you get the
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
blue sheet and the any pink cards that
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
are up there for
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
yes Senator uh thank you for your
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
testimony um the term nuis
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
nuisances or other other similar threats
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
to Public Health can you give me an
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
example of that that's that's kind of a
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
broad brush there can you give me an
 
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.550 align:start position:0%
broad brush there can you give me an
example

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
um the example that I was using when I
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
was talking with the representative uh
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
was that if there was a uh a noxious
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
odor that was coming from either a
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
company or um a a you know septic system
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
or whatever that that would be uh if uh
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know again the the attorneys tell me
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
it's well defined in law okay what a
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
nuisance is and what a nuisance isn't
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that uh I think the amendment that
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Harvey bullers has has
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
some examples in there uh but I don't
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
believe that that's necessary I think it
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
will uh hinder uh any enforcement of
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
that in the future uh because you will
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
have cited some and not others and that
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
right now since it again I'm going to
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
use the term well defined in law that
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
you get everything that's in there right
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
now you don't get limited to anything
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
else but it will not include the things
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
that we were most concerned about when
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
we started this bill and that is things
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
that are of a uh Regional or a uh State
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know where again Mass
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
mandate it couldn't you couldn't do that
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
you couldn't mandate um vaccinations you
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't mandate certain things follow
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
up Mr chairman follow up
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
um so I guess the term
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
nuisance you would recognize it if you
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
saw it or you would recognize it if you
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
smelled it but it and it is defined in
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
law so it is
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
nebulous I would say that that was fair
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
that you know again to you and I it may
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
be nebulous to an attorney okay who has
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
all this case law to go back on I don't
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
believe it is nebulous okay so you
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
know the health officer needs to be
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
educated and other things they'll need
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
to be educated in this and if if there
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
is a question uh that's why we have it
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
in statute so that you the citizen if
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
you disagree with the decision they've
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
made can say that's not a nuisance site
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
why you you think it's not a nuisance
 
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
you representative priest yeah thank you
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman sir would you
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
classify a pandemic like covid as a
 
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.870 align:start position:0%
classify a pandemic like covid as a
nuisance

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
no represent
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
you for introducing the bill son Senor
 
00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
my question is Could you um tell me
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
where in statute nuisances are defined
 
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh I can't again I depended upon the
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
Senate's attorney uh to instruct me in
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
this and he told me it was well defined
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
again the statute isn't the only thing
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
it's decisions from the various courts
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh that help to define the statute so um
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
in addition to going and looking in the
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
rsas you would also have to go into
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
Court decisions especially Supreme Court
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
maor thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um if if
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
I if I heard correctly it's it's kept
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
intentionally nebulous to give the the
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
health officer some
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
latitude well you know the words that
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
are in there right now says says if you
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
go back to the original statute they had
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
the ab ability to regulate nuisances
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
then we add a little bit and then we add
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit and that's what started to
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
cause the confusion so we're trying to
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
get back to that original intent the
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
nuisances and to get to a place where we
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
could get agreement that's why we said
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
other similar things okay and the
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
attorneys again told me it's well
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
nuisances is well defined
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay so to you and I it may be a little
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
nebulous to an attorney they tell me
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's well
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
defined followup thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of where I wanted to go
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
and it maybe I'm just not understanding
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
it if if it's similar threats and
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
similar relates back to nuisance and
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is tighten the
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
language I'm not sure who's defining who
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
has the authority to Define
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
similar in the instance where they are
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
out in the public is this similar to a
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
nuisance or not because I agree that I I
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
haven't asked a question who defines
 
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:14.839 align:start position:0%
what similar is I will refer back to the
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
question that I answered from one of the
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
previous reps is that I can tell you
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
easier what it's not it's not the
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic items coming from the pandemic
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's not those kind of items okay and
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
when I I get to other
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
discussion repr sen Brown thank you Mr
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
question Senator I guess you mentioned
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
earlier on in your testimony that uh the
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
issue is with the getting Public Health
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
officials educated on what nuisance and
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
how these how this is going to be
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
interpreted how is that going to happen
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
especially since we have questions
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
already and we're adding things here
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
that specify it a little bit more but
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying the nuisance and this type
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
of thing they need to have education
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
who's going to do that for Health and
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
Human Services has a group that helps to
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
uh to do all that with the health
 
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
uh to do all that with the health
officers

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.390 align:start position:0%
officers
so

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
followup so with the with the same
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
followup they they already have this
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
ability to get the training and yet we
 
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
seem to have problems interpreting the
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
nuisance portion of this how is this
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to make it better better as
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
opposed to the training that's currently
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
available the language of the original
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know that I have it with me
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think I
 
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
I think I
do

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
um or the the the statute as it is
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
before it was amended by the bill
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
um after it talked about nuisances and
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
then it says they can regulate other
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
whatever okay and that's part the part
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
that caused the confusion and caused
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
them to be able to think that they could
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
do other things and that's why we're
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get back to that concept of
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
nuisances so that they don't have
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
authority to do other things and like I
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
say I don't think I have that part of
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
the statute right here it's just a stri
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
stri out part if you look at the stri
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
out struck out
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
part okay relating to Public Health so
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
they could do anything that related to
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
Public Health according to what they
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
thought and that's certainly not what I
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
want them to be able to do
 
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
want them to be able to do
representative

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair so um RSA 147
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
is very well defined and in fact grants
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
to health officers broad um Authority
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
and judgment to make make calls to
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
protect people from public health
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
hazards excuse me and other kinds of
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
nuisances why Tinker with the
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
wellestablished statute why not just
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
come out with a bill that bans mask
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
mandates if that's what you want H
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's not what I want what I want is
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
the health officers to stay within the
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
box that the legislature has D drawn and
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
legis you know Health officers in
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
Atkinson who decided that only a uh a
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
doctor uh can do a
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
tattoo um you know all the way back to
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
1972 uh when somebody said well gee
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
alcohol is a health risk so I'm going to
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
ban that and another state you know and
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
we we look at during covid and all the
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
people who were the health officers were
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
trying to to regulate things uh that
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
were not unique to their towns that were
 
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.669 align:start position:0%
were not unique to their towns that were
not

00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
nuisances um and so they in my opinion
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh they got out of the box uh and
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
certainly the Genesis of this bill that
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
comes from House Bill
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
154 uh the majority of the house members
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh passed that and sent it on to us in
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate so that certainly was a
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
concern uh that uh uh they were getting
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
away from what the intent of the
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislature was so that's the reason uh
 
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.350 align:start position:0%
legislature was so that's the reason uh
when

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone you know takes words in the
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
statute and um manipulates them or
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
interprets them uh in in a way that was
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
not intended in the beginning um what is
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature to do either accept what
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
they did or to file a bill that brings
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
that uh language back into line and
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
so the representatives here in the
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
general court said well we're going to
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
bring them back in line and and that
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
started with House Bill
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
154 um when I uh took that bill and used
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
it for something else I put the your
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
language or the intent of your language
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
into Senate Bill 63 so both this the
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate have already taken
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
a position that something needs to
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
change in that statute and that it is
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
not being interpreted the way the
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
legislature wants
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.710 align:start position:0%
yella thank you uh thank you for taking
question

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
your goal with this to essentially have
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
some delineation between what is handled
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
by DHHS and what is handled by the local
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
municipality that if if it's handled by
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS then uh kind of the local
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
municipality can help enforce those
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
types of things but they're not to go um
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
beyond what
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
DHHS is saying for you know the bigger
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
health health uh emergencies across the
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
state that question is getting far
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
beyond what this bill does uh I will
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
give you my opinion my opinion is that
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a collaborative and a
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
Cooperative uh effort between uh Health
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and the health
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
officers uh and when either side uh
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
starts to stray too much from what uh
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation is that we
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
need to look at the legislation and
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
modify it and that's exactly what has
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
happened in this
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so regarding the amendment
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering where it says
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
um such as currently um if that were
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
changed to including but not limited to
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
representative G
 
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
representative gray is
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh discussing his he's not discussing
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment I thought he had mentioned
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
that was I I thought he was saying I
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
certainly did mention the amendment that
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
it possible uh and said that uh um that
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
as the language that I I reviewed
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
beforehand I did not support uh because
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
it was not part of the negotiations
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
between the Senate's attorneys and the
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
health officers uh when we reach the
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
agreement on the language that you see
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
in front of you my my only point was I
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
prefer to stick to what Senator gray uh
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
I know we're going to have a
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative speak to the amendment in
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
a few
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
minutes F the questions a representative
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
H uh thank you for taking my question so
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is kind of a followup on what
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative yala said so rather that
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
because again the statute is
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
intentionally Broad in terms of what
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
nuisances are and this makes it even
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
broader with like similar threats which
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
is not defined instead of saying what
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
the municipality can't
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
regulate why not have a bill that says
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
what the state does regulate and that
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
way when there's something like the
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the the municipality is
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
unsure it clearly delineates where the
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility is for who is actually
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
implementing the law and then holds them
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for for if they are or they
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
aren't um my answer to that is don't
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
have a crystal ball representative and
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
if I if I knew you know what to write
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
down uh I wouldn't have to be vague in
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
any of these okay so um again you know
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
the conversation with the attorneys goes
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
original legislation that we had talked
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
about nuisances they expanded that in
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
years past uh for other things okay and
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to bring it back you know
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
towards that new es and that's why you
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
know the definition of nuisances being
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
well defined in law and you know not
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
only through the rsas but through Court
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
decisions about what a nuisance is or
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
isn't uh gets us to where I need to
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
be representative
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I was
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if since the wording is that
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
Health office of a town may make
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
regulations do you feel that um the
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
ending of that says when approved by the
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
Selectmen is a
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
safeguard uh certainly the Selectmen are
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
part of the process now and uh if you
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
look at the original Bill 154 it went
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
further into that with Town meetings and
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
everything else uh certainly I didn't uh
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
think that that was necessary and that
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
away uh but the uh there needs to be
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
some check and balance on the health
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
officers and uh you know having that be
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
maor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
senator for taking another question um
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
and this might be more confirmation
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
since we don't have a we don't have a
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
hearing report on this do I understand
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
correctly did I hear correctly that the
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
health Officers Association support
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
63 and and the language that is in here
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
now uh the last statement I remember is
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
they do not uh any longer oppose it I I
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
will not go to the the part that says
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
they support it okay the health officers
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
and since I didn't do the negotiations
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
and anything that I tell you is hearsay
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh because I didn't uh do that I I think
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
I did get an email that says they didn't
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
oppose it but again that's you know I I
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
am almost 75 and you know I I I don't
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
remember every email that I got so thank
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
further uh representative
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
stavis uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking another question so has
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
there been a public hearing on this bill
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh there was several public hearings on
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
this bill on this particular iteration
 
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill yeah there was if you look
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
back in the docket uh that we uh
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
published the uh Amendment or or this
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
exact version probably not this exact
 
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
version okay that's exactly what I meant
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
well again you know you have rules on on
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
germanness in this and if you look at
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that was that did have the
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing and the information that
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh that was in there and talked about
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
unique situations Etc uh
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know that uh let's see
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
I had written uh such other
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
regulation uh um relating to Public
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
Health for conditions unique to the town
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay those were changed and it goes it
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
went back to the uniqueness so um I
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't expect you guys to have a a public
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
hearing on every Nuance that's changed
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
uh but the intent is clear uh both uh in
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that did get the public hearing
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
and what you see in front of you is that
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh we want to get back to that
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
definition of uh
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
nuances uh and things that uh are uh in
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
the privy of the health officer to
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
control because it's Unique to that town
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
or uh important to that town in
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
the follow up Mr chair followup uh thank
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so just to be clear and so
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
I see in the docket that there was a
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing on S
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
sp63 which was an an act enabling
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt a tax credit for
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
qualified private community property
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
owners correct and there was a public
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on the bill that pertained to
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
elections but there's no public hearing
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
on S sp63 as it came comes before us to
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you will look into there you will see
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the public hearing was
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
held on the amendment I'm not trying to
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
educate you on procedure but both in the
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate until the body acts
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill does not change
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
and that is only accomplished when an
 
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is adopted by the body okay so
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
the title didn't change until that
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
amendment was accepted uh and that's why
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
when we publish the amendment we
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
published the amendment by the amendment
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
number and uh and uh that the public
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is and we make the amendment at
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
least available if not uh but it was
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
there at the public hearing and uh you
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
can see the public hearing report if you
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
go in and look and clearly um
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative buer uh you know Harvey
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
bullier was there uh testifying against
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
it they are testifying to it uh the
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
health officers were there uh um again
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
you know again I'm not trying to educate
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
you on the the policy uh but this is
 
00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:38.519 align:start position:0%
same thing that happens all the time in
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
these house
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
committees for the questions excuse me I
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
have one Senator um so talking about
 
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
nuisances we we see that in uh RSA 147
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually very well defined uh you
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
stated that the attorneys believe that
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
nuisances are well find and I probably
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
sp63 wouldn't
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
it rather than adding striking out that
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
language and adding or other similar
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
threats to Public Health why not just
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
strike out that one sentence wouldn't
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
that get us to where we want to be where
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's just nuisances because I agree that
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
when you start trying to Define
 
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
individual things it it becomes watered
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
down and pretty much useless in trying
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
to get to an agreement to consensus with
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
the health officers okay um they wanted
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
words in there that talked about other
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
similar things so again you know is the
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill perfect the way it is you know if
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
you ask me no but it is perfect enough
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
that I can I can support it and as I
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
said before I believe that the health
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
officers have said that they no longer
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
oppose it okay very good so we we're
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get to that sweet spot where
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
nobody is completely happy but everybody
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
says yeah we've done the right thing
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
gotcha representative kahill thank you
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you senator for taking my
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
my question don't don't you think that
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
we should be looking for the approval of
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
the people and not necessarily the
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
health officers I mean striking striking
 
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
the language as suggested by by our
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
chair I think would be the right thing
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
to do and and the people is who we
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
should be looking out for not the health
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
officers again representative that's why
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
you're a representative you know is you
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
have an opinion okay who is the right
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
people to um guide me uh who was
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to have the knowledge of uh how
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
different compounds or different odors
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
different situations are going to affect
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
me that's the health officer and through
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
statutes we have have invested both in
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
health and human services and the health
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
officers in the towns certain
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for providing us the
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
correct information detailed information
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
about that and so I am going back the
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
way the statute was in in the original
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
form is that yes these Health officers
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
have special knowledge and that that's
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
officers follow up do sir to your
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge do you know if every single
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
town or municipality has a health
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
officer I believe that the state when
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
they don't have a health officer uh
 
00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
duties okay representative power thank
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you senator
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
for taking a follow-up question is it
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
true that some nuisances require
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
immediate attention and therefore it
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
would um not be impractical to for
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
example wait till to for an annual
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
meeting to get the approval of the
 
00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body if if it's a town I
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
believe that that is
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
correct further
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
much senator for your testimony uh next
 
00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:23.720 align:start position:0%

basically introducing everything um and
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
I appreciate all the work that has been
 
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
done on the other side of the wall with
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
regards to this issue um members of uh
 
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
the house have been working on this
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
particular section of the RSA since
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
2020 um and I've included in the packet
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
a recent Bill history it it probably
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
goes back farther than that but as far
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
as um what I've done on this particular
 
00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.589 align:start position:0%
as um what I've done on this particular
section

00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
is here under recent Bill history um
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
when this bill under house bill
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
1272 um and I have included the language
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
here a very similar version of it passed
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh on the cons consent calender by this
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
committee um and it went on to the
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
Senate but um so what what prompted the
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
what prompted this bill in the first
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
place um was obviously I think everybody
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
knows at this point the uh the The Mask
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
mandates but I don't want to say that
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
this bill is about mask mandates it is
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
not limited that by any means whatsoever
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
um so I appreciate your Indulgence in
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about it as a whole um as is
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
already sort of been uh talked about by
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
Senator gray but um personally um I went
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
to my select board and in my town and um
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
my select man said that he would prefer
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh if he could place everybody under a
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandate for the entire town at
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
this time it was the height of the covid
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic and I thought well sure as heck
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
I do not want to be wake up one day and
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine mandate uh addressed to
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
me and myself my my whole town
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
um now I just want to sort of address
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
the fact and I have put in if you look
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
three there is I've put in the entire
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
title 10 Public Health chapter as it is
 
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
seen uh if you look in the rsas it's got
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
the title and everything I think it's
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
very telling that it's about nuisances
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
toilets drains expectoration rubbish and
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
waste um and some Representatives have
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
brought up well you know obviously
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation uh is pertains very
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
broadly and that has been how it has
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
been interpreted by some is extremely uh
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
broadly it says um and the the
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
actionable Clause here is you know and
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
such other regulations relating to
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
Public Health that's what the discussion
 
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.430 align:start position:0%
Public Health that's what the discussion
is

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
about as in their judgment the health
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
and safety of people
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
require so some have brought up well
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's a cart blanch but I would argue
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
for two reasons it is not for
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
one there is no requirement for any
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um if you read it shall take
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
effect when approved by the selectman in
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
a possibly as little as just a public
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
meeting so it doesn't even necessarily
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to be listed on the agenda they
 
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
simply have to pass it at a public
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and post it to me that begs the
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
idea that this is really what possibly
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
they meant to write is they may make
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
regulations for the prevention and
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
removal of nuisances and
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
other and other similar things to
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
nuisances as uh Senate Bill 63 now
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
stands they meant it as obviously to be
 
00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
limited to such local things as uh
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
nuisances and we'll get into the
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
definition a little bit in a little bit
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so for one that is why um we have
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
that uh you you got um you know it would
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
have been so when Selectmen make
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
regulations and ordinances usually it's
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
requires public hearings it's there's a
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
there's a process when you have a zoning
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
amendment requires two public hearings
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
is there's a it's extensive um what has
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
to happen in order for a zoning
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment to pass the two public
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
hearings it's it's in the
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
statute um so in my opinion that and the
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
title of this section does not uh Bell
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
any sort of cart blanch to make any sort
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
of law that they think is vaguely
 
00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
relates to Public Health
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
or uh any sort of thing that could be
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
construed as public
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
health um okay so I have put in
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
so you know by the uh history of the
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
bill which um Senator has already
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
introduced um and at the bottom of page
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
one uh it's got the role of the health
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
officer this is just taken off the
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
health officer website for our state um
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
broaden authority to investigate public
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
and sanitary concerns um Health officers
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
shall inquire into all nuisances and
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
other causes of danger these may include
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
and they list the tip typical things
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
garbage pests and sanitary conditions
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
septic failures rodents and more um
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
there are no training or qualification
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
requirements Beyond providing your
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
criminal records
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
history um and you get a three-hour
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
training course and I'm not saying there
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
are some health officers who have
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
degrees in public health but by and
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
large for most
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
towns um this pertains to the health
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
officer which also maybe for instance in
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
our town does other things is also a
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
selectman um and they're possibly
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
wearing multiple hats they have taken a
 
00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
wearing multiple hats they have taken a
three-hour

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
three-hour
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
training and that is all that they they
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
are have otherwise they're an employee
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
on page two I've um listed a whole bunch
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
of items because in the past I've
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
received questions about well what about
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know asbest and what about bed bugs
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
and so uh these this page on page two is
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
a just a list of all the different rsas
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
covering all sorts of other things that
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
Health officers have to deal with and I
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
think the reason why Health officers
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
generally don't show up to this to these
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
types of hearings I'm I'm wondering if
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know they don't want extra hoties
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
because if you look at this this is
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
their plates are full and this is a
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
partial list it goes on to page three
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is by no means the end of the list
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
it is there's quite a bit in there and I
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh I invite anyone to go on to the
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
website there's little
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
um little little Pages um for each
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
subject matter one of them is
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
communicable and infectious diseases
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
which at the end of the packet after I
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
guess it would be page nine but it's not
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
listed there's a section called
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
communicable and infectious diseases and
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
just you know the reason why I bring
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
this up is because I want everyone to
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
see that it's in no way does has DHHS in
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
any of the guidance documents I've read
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
through ever Advocate mask mandates
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
Health mandates keeping lists of um your
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
guests tatto uh ordinances against
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors or that would inhibit uh
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
requiring the requiring of extra
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
licensing for
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
businesses so um under this communicable
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
diseases uh ADV uh guidance from DHHS it
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
is the goal the role of the health
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
officer is mainly a supportive role of
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
reporting cases of disease educ
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
dispensing of educational materials
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
posting Signs regarding swimming or
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated beaches so I can't find
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
anything on in here um
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
about uh passing ordinances I mean you
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
know or other such things um so that it
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
is quite consistent with all the
 
00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
documents um on their
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
website uh to limit as Senator gray said
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
this language is is very important to
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
keep Health officers when within their
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
box I think they'll actually appreciate
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
this and having it defined and having a
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
more tightly uh written language for
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
them to adhere to um
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
um a couple of
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
examples on page four it's an ordinance
 
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
by the town of hover I just wanted to
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
give you some examples of mask mandates
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
this one number
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
39 is the mask mandate for Handover it
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
sites New Hampshire RSA 147 colon 1
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
under the authority
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
um there were probably six towns that
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
had mask ordinances and
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
cities um and they did use this um
 
00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:38.470 align:start position:0%
cities um and they did use this um
particular

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
RSA this mask mandate uh that Han
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
Hanover wrote pertains to applies to any
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
outdoor area where where where
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
businesses have uh are doing
 
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
business um it mandates that um
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
businesses must sh you know post the
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
requirement for a mask and it only
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
pertains if you look at number seven to
 
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.710 align:start position:0%
pertains if you look at number seven to
certain

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
zones um so I assume they are they think
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
that people are familiar with their
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
zoning um under number eight it pertains
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
to children under the age of two or up
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh Age Two or
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
older um so you know we're this is I
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
guess to just to to give you an idea of
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
how comp complex some of these laws are
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
it's not simply we pass a mask mandate
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to expire at a certain
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
time you know and it's very
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
temporary um we got Lebanon has their
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
own they also site RSA 47 colon
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
17 um it is applies to any business
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
governmental or nonprofit owned business
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
transportation okay
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
and they have it apply to Children three
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
years of age and
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
up that also has an effective date but
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
no expiration
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
date so at the PO bottom of page six I
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
get into a few of the business related
 
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:20.839 align:start position:0%
ordinances um that have passed things
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
that um make it difficult for businesses
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
to establish themselves in town
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise legal businesses that have
 
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
their own New Hampshire licensing
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
requirements uh we have tattoo parlors
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
and massage parlers are seem to be the
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
main issues here so um on page seven you
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
have an example of the exiter health
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
regulations and other establishment
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
establishing a license a separate
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
license if uh they they want to
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
establish a massage parlor for lack of a
 
00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:58.109 align:start position:0%
establish a massage parlor for lack of a
better

00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
therapy um
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
under let's see the application section
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
Atkinson has a very similar one and it
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
also cites RSA 147 colon one under um at
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
the top of page eight it says that the
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of the ordinance is to protect
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
the safety Health and Welfare so it
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
seems to be again where they've taken
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the Clause any other regulation
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
and and and had quite a bit of Liberty
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
with it I would
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
say um
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
so just to briefly touch on and I'm
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
almost done I'm wrapping it up
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
um okay one more example is the tattoo
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
parlor where on page eight under article
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
three this is where it says that only a
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
qualified physician shall Mark the body
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
um of any other person by means of a
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
tattoo that some would construe I'm not
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to assign motive but some would
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
construe that as an effort
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
to keep out undesirable businesses uh
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
from town and then you have the uh
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
Albany still has on this on their books
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
and on their website as of today this
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
sort of ordinance that that uh prohibits
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
the possession of alcohol on public
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
streets doesn't say whether it's an open
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
Bott bottle or not I assume they mean
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
open bottle but it doesn't say
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
that so um about this the whole subject
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
of new
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
definition um so I have not been able to
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
find a definition of nuisance in our
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
statutes that pertains to this public
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
health there are some definitions that
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
pertain to like things to do with drug
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh controlled drugs and and other
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
sections firefighting I think but
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
nothing not that I have seen um yet but
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Public Health nuisance
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
task force in 2010 did have a task force
 
00:49:26.109 --> 00:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
and a 27 page document that has and I'll
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
send everybody St the link um for the
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of investigating this
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
particular portion of of law um so I
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
think I hope you all read it but um so
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
it says that they're from their from
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
their uh document that they put out they
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
express the need to better understand
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
and Define RSA 147 nuisances toilets
 
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.910 align:start position:0%
and Define RSA 147 nuisances toilets
drains

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
drains
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
Etc um to achieve this goal a public
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
health nuisance task force was formed
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
comprised of a diverse group of
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
professionals and it's a very good
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
document um there's a lot in there one
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
of the things that's not in there though
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
is sort of a suggestion any kind of
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
suggestion in any way that Health
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
officers stray from such ordinary things
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
as uh that is defined and they do Define
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
what a public health nuisance is in this
 
00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
document I have put that uh definition
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page eight
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
nuisance defined this is uh just copy
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
and pasted from the
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
document and I'm not going to read it to
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
you because it is exactly what you would
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
think it is um it interferes with the
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
use and enjoyment of property and um is
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
related to land use basically uh it is
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
not about uh an individual's Behavior
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
Etc um so that is why if if uh the chair
 
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.710 align:start position:0%
Etc um so that is why if if uh the chair
is

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay and with me discussing my Amendment
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
the reason for my
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is that a permissible um you
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
may if you could kind of make it a
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
little quick yes because we are already
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
way behind oh okay sorry um so I I
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
created this amendment
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
um based off of the list uh from the New
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health Officers Association
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is on page three um which they
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
suggested that they needed these sort of
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
things um to act on in an emergency
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination septic breach
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste release and flooding
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
scenarios this is directly from their
 
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.549 align:start position:0%
scenarios this is directly from their
suggestion

00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
and I have had um requests to firm up
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
the language um because we are not
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers I suppose and a lot of
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh individuals read this uh for instance
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
well I mean this applies to towns and
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the towns are
 
00:52:03.079 --> 00:52:03.870 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the towns are
their

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
voters so it seems to be that we want
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
something that is specific enough for
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
the lay person to understand what other
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
similar threats might be so I have put
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
in other similar threats such as
 
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.390 align:start position:0%
in other similar threats such as
groundwater

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
contamination as far as pasas septic
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
breaches Etc and that is to give the
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
public an idea of what that is supposed
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
to mean and also the health officers so
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
that they might might understand that as
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
well and I apologize if I went too long
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much if you have any
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
comments question uh representative
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so U I
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
understand that um as an example of an
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
overreach and application of RSA
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
147 would be what we saw during the
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic with regards to
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
covid would masks or vaccines either
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
remove covid which was construed to be a
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
nuisance thank you very much
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative your question is would
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
would would masks no um I don't believe
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
so um I haven't found any information to
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
the the contrary
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
masks were not in fact I believe I had
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
testimony before this same committee
 
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
testimony before this same committee
last

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
year where I studied the different mask
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
mandate different towns that had enacted
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
mask mandates and their rate of
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
covid and by comparison there they were
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
no different than their immediately
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns thank you
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you Mr uh
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
question uh do you think that an
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
outbreak of communicable diseases like
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
measles or
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
hepatitis would be a nuisance under your
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you for your question
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh no no not nuisance so
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
nuisance even if it's not defined in
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
rsay is actually defined in the
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
dictionary so I assume and I'm not an
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
expert in the sort of what the lawyers
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
would say in a court case but if it is
 
00:54:28.359 --> 00:54:29.829 align:start position:0%
would say in a court case but if it is
not

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
defined um nuisance the common
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
definition I would assume still uh is
 
00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799 align:start position:0%
defi is that that particular definition
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
would still apply So Co is not a
 
00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
nuisance but any other sort of
 
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.510 align:start position:0%
nuisance but any other sort of
[Music]

00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
thing that is that is the operative term
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
here thank you I hope that answers your
 
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
question for the comments of
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
questions I have one for you uh
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
um over here
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative oh
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
sorry um the original language that was
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
in HB
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
154 and just a very quick answer do you
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
think that is better than either of
 
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
these the two amendments that are
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
sitting before
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
us uh thank you for your question
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
chair I
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
I I I think the priority
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
is to limit I think the priority is is
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
either Senate Bill 63 or with all due
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
respect my amendment I think that is the
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
priority here is to Define this properly
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
I think that is the most important thing
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
at this this time I think it's my
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
original House Bill 154 which um is in
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
here I put it here it
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't limit anything I I just
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
want to know if you thought which one
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
was better in your opinion that's all
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
yella thank you um it seems like you've
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research on this are you
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with any power of um like the
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislative body
 
00:56:22.349 --> 00:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
or DHHS to identify like the overreach
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
let's say in the tattoo parlor or let's
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
say Banning alcohol on all streets um or
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
the possession of alcohol on all streets
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
when they when the legislative body or
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
the um DHHS identifies that as being
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of what is
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable do they ha have you found any
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
power granted to those people to be able
 
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
to affect that change so that you know
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative body could I don't know
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
resend the health ordinance or the d uh
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS has the the power to say this is
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
not appropriate this is uh you know have
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
you seen anything like that or is it
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
just up to the health officer and maybe
 
00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.270 align:start position:0%
just up to the health officer and maybe
the

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
Selectmen that's a great question
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative yo Kella um I have not
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
seen anything uh as far as a clawback I
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
assume there's a possibility that
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
there's a rule
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere um but I haven't heard of any
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
instances of that happening thank
 
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so about the amendment um
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
if the such as were changed um to say
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to instead um
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
what um would that um change your
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
thinking on the amendment at
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
all thank you very much um
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher for that
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
question that's that's an interesting
 
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
point that you rais
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's personally I don't
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
necessary um because or other similar
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
threats it that doesn't limit it it's
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
not saying it's giving examples so or
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
other similar threats is really the
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
operative that I see it as the operative
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
phrase here and then my addition of just
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
such as is just it's sort of like a
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
helping phrase I for lack of a better
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
term I I don't think it's necessary but
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
I I think the more qualifiers you put on
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
there also if I'm not sure to be to be
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
honest seeing no more questions thank
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I have one more
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
pink card but thank you very much is she
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
BL no she's not here Richard
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
all right uh not seeing her we're going
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and close the hearing on S
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
sp63 because we are way behind I
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
apologize to those in the back of the
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
room uh here for other bills the
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
chairman once again has underestimated
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
the timing on the very first bill uh
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
with that we will go ahead and open up
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing on HB uh SB 531
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
Senator gray I see you are here to
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
introduce this one
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the record my name is
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
James Gray I represent Senate District 6
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
which starts up in Alton gilmington
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
comes down Route 11 to Rochester uh this
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
one hopefully we can get you uh some of
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
your time back a little bit um this bill
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
has to do with local control and that
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
the state does not need to be involved
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
in uh background checks of your health
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
officers um you know certainly they do
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
have an oversight uh of the health
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
officers uh as part of the
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility but uh certainly the
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
local governments are well within their
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
capability of of choosing their health
 
01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:12.039 align:start position:0%
officers and investigating them uh we
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
don't uh get involved in a lot of the
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
other employees that the that the towns
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh hire so uh we don't need to be
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
involved in this
 
01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
one representative K uh representative
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
Brown could you grab me the blue sheet
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
on this bill please SP 531 questions for
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative gray representative uh uh
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
Senator gray representative y Kella
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for your brief
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
introduction um however reading the bill
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's still it uh it seems like uh in
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
line two and three the state is still
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
requiring that municipalities shall
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
request and obtain the criminal history
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
information the it seems like the the
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
change of this law is just to that it
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be submitted to DHHS
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
anymore is that your um pretty much okay
 
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.510 align:start position:0%
anymore is that your um pretty much okay
thank

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman um and
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for being here has
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
there been a problem in the local
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
governments municipalities towns where
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
um the health officers was a security
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
risk and this is the reason why we're
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
having this
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
law again I believe that the statute out
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
there is for them to to do this is
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
existing uh so that if I keep on doing
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
it then I don't have a problem uh so I I
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
I can't really answer your question uh
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
but uh for right now there's no reason
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
why that needs to be done at the state
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
level it can be done at the local level
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
followup represent yes thank you as a
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
followup was there a problem um with the
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
localities not doing this not requesting
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
this as a part of their hiring process
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
as best I know uh I don't have the the
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
all of the background on this but when
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh the department came and requested it
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
of me um it was an ongoing process to do
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
these background checks and having it
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
done at the local level uh should save
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
time and effort uh because when they're
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
considering people uh they won't submit
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
people who can't pass a background
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
check representative power thank you Mr
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to to to be
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
clear is it correct in my understanding
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
that the requirement for the
 
01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:50.430 align:start position:0%
that the requirement for the
municipality

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
to um obtain and then submit the
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
criminal history record to DHHS was that
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of DHHS reviewing that
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
they can they can speak to that when
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
they come up to testify but uh that's as
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know that was part of the
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
approval process is that uh there be a
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
background check done
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
questions um I have two quick ones for
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
you Senator um yes sir on the language
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
itself um there two phrases that I'd
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
like you to give me a little input on
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
that one is on on line seven when it
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
talks about shall employ its discretion
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
what does that
 
01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
what does that
mean

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:42.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
L you get to the bill itself I I
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
probably would rather the Health and
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh contact you testify on
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
that um we can do that okay uh further
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine the most of the input that I
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
had in here is that the original uh
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion when it came to me um did not
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the Health and Human Services
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
oversight uh and they still have an
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
oversight role in this even though
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
they're not doing the selecting or or
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
doing the background check and since you
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
brought up that word that was the other
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
question I had for you on line nine what
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
does subject to oversight mean what will
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
is that something better that they're
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
going to answer or I would I would think
 
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the original Bill didn't have that
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
but when they testified in the Senate uh
 
01:04:37.950 --> 01:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
they were also espousing that again you
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
know they do have a role uh in the
 
01:04:45.309 --> 01:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
health officers activities and so I
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
wanted this bill as modified to to
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
recognize that role and I believe that
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
they will talk to that I'll hold those
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
questions for them then thank you
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislation the legislation proposes to
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
amend RSA 128 section 9 to no longer
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
require municipalities to send a health

officer candidates background check to
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
the department as a prerequisite to any
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
nomination the department has a
 
01:06:08.789 --> 01:06:08.799 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate to appoint and

RSA
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
128 while Town Health officers are
 
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
Department appointed they're ultimately
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
Town employees nominated by a board of
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and serve subject to local
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
human resource practices as Town Health
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
officers are Municipal Employees we
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
believe that they should be subject to
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
established local hiring practices prior
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
to confirmation by the
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
department the legislation if enacted
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
would provide local municipalities the
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
authority to determine what convictions
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
on a candidate's background check would
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
be considered disqualifying consistent
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
with its own established hiring
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
practices additionally the proposed
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
legislation would remove the
 
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
Department's response responsibility to
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
review and store candidates background
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
checks which are sensitive documents
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
this would eliminate any privacy
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
concerns related to background checks
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation does retain the the
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
Department's ability for oversight in
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
the appointment or termination of Health
 
01:07:15.069 --> 01:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
officers if
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
warranted in closing the department
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
believes that Senate Bill 531 restores
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
local Authority in selecting Town Health
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
officer nominees reduces privacy
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
concerns and decreases administrative
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
burden thank you for your time and I'm
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
available for any
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative McDonald Mr
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question where can I
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
find what the disqualifying things would
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
be for not being a health officer what
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
would disqualify me from being a health
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
officer um what would be considered
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
disqualifying is that what I'm are they
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
in your rules or where are they um
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
I know that our rules were amended this
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
year we actually added rules to RSA 128
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
and to be honest I would have to review
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
those rules to determine what is defined
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
as um being able to be removed may I you
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
do a followup
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely what are the current rules
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of are there any um I
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%

yella thank you kind of uh going back to
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
the your statement about oversight and
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
specifically around termination
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
um what does oversight mean like for
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
example the ones that have been
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
proferred here today about uh regulating
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors um or or Banning alcohol
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
possession of alcohol in a would would
 
01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.189 align:start position:0%
possession of alcohol in a would would
um

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
does the DHHS have any power to say hey
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
you've you've done something
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and and uh
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
fix uh either are you guys actively kind
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
of monitoring them and and uh saying
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
like hey this is good or this is
 
01:09:17.709 --> 01:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
approved um or and um if you found
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
something that was inappropriate do you
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
have the power to say that this should
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
not be the uh a health ordinance or or
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
the person entirely what what is the
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
scope of the oversight sure that's a
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
great question so um so we provide um
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
Health officers that appointment right
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
like that you are confirmed by the
 
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
department to fulfill the requirements
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
of Health officer law but you are a town
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
employee so Health officers act in a way
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
that their towns have oversight over
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
local laws passing local laws we know
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
that every town some towns regulate
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlors and some towns don't but
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
that's a municipal Authority that we
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to overstep that Authority
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
certainly um in situations where there's
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
potential groundwater contamination then
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
de's rules come into play um and Dees
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
would have additional oversight over
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
those particular cases so in many
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
situations that Health officers respond
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
to they're working alongside another
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
department so there is that that
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
oversight as they respond but primarily
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
if you're question is passing local
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances um that's again subject to
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
the towns requirements that the town's
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
processes if I'm answering your question
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
correctly in my tenure I am not aware of
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
any times that we have had to remove a
 
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
health officer towns will come to us if
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's um questionable conduct by a
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
health officer and we can certainly
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
review um that history or that activity
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
that the health officer has engaged in
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
um but there's never been a situation
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
rise to the level where the department
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:56.510 align:start position:0%
 
position

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
followup okay so but so your statement
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
is that you've never seen someone
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
actually be removed
 
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
but also implied I guess I want to make
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
explicit in your testimony is that they
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
since it is confirmed by DHHS there is a
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
potential for DHHS to remove that
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
confirmation and say you are no longer
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to be the health officer yes we
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
certainly have that Authority Within the
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
law as it is now thank
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
Elwood thank you madam Vice chair for
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question and um welcome this
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
morning thank you is it true that um
 
01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.149 align:start position:0%
morning thank you is it true that um
towns

01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
share Health
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
officers smaller towns
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
share so in in certain situations for
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
small towns it is very hard to find
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
someone to fulfill this role so one
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
Health officer may serve in multiple
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
towns but they need to be appointed in
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
each of those towns so for example if
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
the health officer in Chichester is
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
asked by the town of eping or um to to
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
serve Epsom then that Health officer can
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
certainly serve in both towns the
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
department would just need to um make
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
that confirmation for them so they can
 
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.629 align:start position:0%
that confirmation for them so they can
serve

01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
serve
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
concurrently thank you yes
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you Mr
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
question so is it true that in the um
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
roles and responsibilities and duties of
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
a health officer is it would it be true
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
that they they're dual hated and
 
01:12:41.629 --> 01:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
that they function um as on behalf of
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
the state of State departments as as
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
well as um local
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities so they are Municipal
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
Employees who serve at our request and
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
very often um you know they conduct
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
School inspections on behalf um of the
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education they do
 
01:12:59.950 --> 01:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
foster care licensing inspections for
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
Services um so they act on behalf of the
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
departments in certain situations um but
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
they are Municipal Employees I hope that
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
answers your
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
question further questions
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.030 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
so what's the position on the towns have
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
they've given you any feedback in regard
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
to them wanting to take on this
 
01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.750 align:start position:0%
to them wanting to take on this
responsibility

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
so I have received concerns about
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
privacy that why you know why do I need
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
to send this to you to be very honest
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
when we've already done this and this
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
background check result is satisfying by
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
our standards why then do you need to
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
have that additional review process
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I've heard follow up Mr
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
chairman so what I what I really meant
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
is that U have the towns requested um
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
that um that that responsibility go back
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
to them in all cases
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
the overall responsibility for the
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
review process of this as opposed
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
to them having the responsibility and
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
then the state wanting to take it and
 
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
just say we would like this
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility our S period so I haven't
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
gotten that request directly but there
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
I've gotten concerns about why do you
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
need to see this that's what I thank
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
you representative y
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you thank you for taking
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
another question um so
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
so going back to the fact that you have
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
to confirm essentially authorize even
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
though the person got hired by the local
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
municipality you have to confirm at DHHS
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to provide this
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
role what if not the background check
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
are you using to decide whether or not
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
someone is appropriate for that role or
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
not so that's determined at the local
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
level the town determines what candidate
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
they would like to serve in that role
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
they perform the background check and
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
then they submit that candidate to us
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
there is no other requirements that we
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
look for in order to say that's an
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate candidate or not it is the
 
01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:08.709 align:start position:0%
appropriate candidate or not it is the
town's

01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
town's
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility go ahead follow um so I
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
guess with your response why even have
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
your guys'
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
perun coronation yeah if you will um if
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
you guys are not ever denying anyone for
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
any reason I guess why why even have
 
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.669 align:start position:0%
any reason I guess why why even have
that

01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh legislative or the that um you know
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory step yeah it's a great
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
question so in a lot of cases um you
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
well always it's important for us to
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
know at the local level who is the
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
health officer so in cases of emergency
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
cases of concerns that come to our level
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
we want to know who to be able to
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
contact at that local level um that
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
information um that Emer contact is very
 
01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
important for us especially in
 
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
situations of emerging concerns or um
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
emergency situations um and again Health
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
officers do serve um for the Department
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
in a number of functions like these
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
types of inspections of schools and dayc
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
carees and foster care licensing um so
 
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's important to have an appointed
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
role representative
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you in your
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
testimony you you're talking about these
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
these other um things that you're using
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
the health officers for that are not the
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
purview of the Town those are separate
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
agencies do you do
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
I do the health officers have access to
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
other private information other
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
information that they they wouldn't have
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
through the town through you guys um we
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%

situations of communicable disease where
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of infectious disease um
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
control if they're investigating a
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
certain situation in a town they have a
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
a privacy agreement with the health
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
officer um the health officer has taken
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
um all the Privacy um training hipa
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
training um and that's outlined in RSA
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
141c there is that protection um an
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
agreement outlined that health offic
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
need to have in order to receive
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
information further
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
questions I have one or two um line
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
seven that I asked Senator gray about
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
employ it's discretion yes um give me a
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
little information what exactly does
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
that mean so um the the sentence States
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
each municipality shall employ its
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
discretion when reviewing background
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
checks so every town may have its every
 
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
town has its established hiring
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
practices and they may have um guidance
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
on what type of conviction would be
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
disqualifying and what type of
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
conviction would not be disqualifying so
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
the municipality has its ability to
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
utilize its own hiring practices and
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation of qualifying um or
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
disqualifying convictions to um apply to
 
01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.189 align:start position:0%
disqualifying convictions to um apply to
this

01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
nomination and second question maybe
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
simplifying the questions that
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative yella asked about
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
oversight is it my understanding
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
that even though the town's going
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
through the search process would you the
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
DHS DHHS still have the ability to
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
basically veto a health officer's
 
01:18:47.709 --> 01:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
appointment to that town yes we can
 
01:18:47.719 --> 01:18:48.470 align:start position:0%
appointment to that town yes we can
thank

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
testing thank you very much and I
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
believe that's all the pink cards we
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
have on that anybody else wanting to
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
speak I see none we'll close the hearing
 
01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
all right uh we'll go ahead and open up
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing now on SB
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
447 establishing a committee to study
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
the inclusion of Transportation expenses
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
in default budgets Senator ch Ley you
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
are up thank you very much and good
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Shannon chandley
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
and I have the honor of serving the
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
people of District 11 in the state
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
senate um I come before you today to
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
introduce s SP 447 relative to funding
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
School transportation services under the
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
default budget um the bill uh
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
establishes a study committee something
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
I know that we are sometimes reluctant
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
to do because there are so many but I
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
would submit that this is an efficient
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
and Nimble way to get some answers about
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
a very Co um complex subject the
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
original uh Bill what I originally
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
intended was to try
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
to address the issue of um default
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
budgets uh related to
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation um in a single bill but
 
01:20:54.189 --> 01:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
what became clear immediately is that
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
the issue is is um complex as well and
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
and may require the input of more
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to understand the best
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
solution um it was a request of one of
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
the saus in my district that has had uh
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
to rely on default budgets transport
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
while uh the SAU is required to
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
transport some students in certain
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances Transportation budgets um
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
are not included in the default budgets
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that they are often
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
contracts um this has become a problem
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
in some communities and this bill here
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
does not propose a solution but in fact
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
proposes a way to get to a solution I
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
ask that you look favorably upon the
 
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
bill and I am happy to take any
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill thank
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um outside the the
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
we probably do need to find a solution
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
but here on line five it says it be one
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
member of the Senate and on line six
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
three members of the House of
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
Representative do you think that since
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate is requesting this that maybe
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
there should be multiple members of the
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
Senate equal equal share of
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
workload um I don't think that would be
 
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
the best solution I think that since
 
01:22:23.629 --> 01:22:23.639 align:start position:0%
there are 400 members of the house
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Talent on which to draw
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
and there are 24 Senators so I really do
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
believe that the three Representatives
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
would serve well and um of course the
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
four members of the subcommittee um
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
could call upon any stakeholders who
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
might be able to provide good um uh
 
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
information for the
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
question um so being very familiar with
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
the default budget law um the it seems
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
to me that there if the transportation
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
was required by law let's say if you're
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
you're far away from the the school or
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be or um special
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
ed or whatever those things required by
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
law would be able to be included in the
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
default budget and if the
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
contract that you stated um was put
 
01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
before the vote voters instead of just
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
signed by the by the uh School Board
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
then it would be able to be part of the
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
default budget so I guess my question is
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
what what situations other than things
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
that require um are required by law um
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
and and then the other transportation is
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
just not a one-time expense so it's
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
recurring so it would be flat every
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
single year so I guess what what is
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
where is that need not being met I guess
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
in all those three different cases so
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
from my understanding from my the SAU is
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
that they were not able to include the
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
transportation budget in their
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
calculation now I also did speak to the
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and they were more
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
than happy to take part in this um
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussion because they believed that um
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
we need maybe perhaps greater education
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.430 align:start position:0%
 
further

01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony uh next up we
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%

01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
stated um the bill doesn't um really uh
 
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
provide a solution to some of the
 
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
challenges that school districts are
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
facing with Rising Transportation costs
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
but hopefully the study committee or the
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
study commission can can um help uh a
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide discussion on what school
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
districts might be able to do to either
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
include that in the default budget or to
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
at least address some of the rising
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
costs that we've seen relative to School
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
District transportation I have a handout
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
here um not a handout but I have a a
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
short PDF of just to um identify the
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
rising costs that school districts are
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
facing with Transportation the Lichfield
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
School District uh their FY 24 cost was
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
$371 per day per bus their FY 25 cost is
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
$445 per day per bus Dairy
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
$421 per day per bus uh uh for FY 24 for
 
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.229 align:start position:0%
$421 per day per bus uh uh for FY 24 for
fy2

01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
fy2
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
$459 uh per day per bus so we're seeing
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
um at least a $50 per day um per bus
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
increase um for transportation costs I
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
presume there are many reasons for that
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh having a hard time fin to find bus
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
drivers so those districts are having to
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
increase their pay or not sorry those
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
districts but the bus companies are
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
having to increase pay or have longevity
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
bonuses or sign on bonuses um I presume
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that the price of diesel is also driving
 
01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
up some of those costs as well too so
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
anything um that uh uh anytime we can
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
get a group of stakeholders across the
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
table to help look at some of these
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
issues that are impacting local school
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
district budgets um the school board's
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
Association is in favor of so we support
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
the bill and and would be happy to
 
01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide whatever expertise or knowledge
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
or background or information we could if
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
indeed there is a a study committee or a
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
study commission that moves forward and
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony I'm happy to
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for uh taking
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
the question um kind of alluding back to
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
my my PRI prior question and and since
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like you have some stats um do
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
do those uh districts that you were
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
current you were just referencing have a
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
contract with that bus company that
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
could have foreseen those increases and
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
if the that municipal had to put that
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
contract on the ballot being included in
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
the default budget um would that have
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
solved the problem that you're that
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
you're raising here sure thank you for
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
the question referee son that's a good
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
question um most of the contracts that
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
school districts are signing with
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation companies are three to
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
fiveyear contracts um and one of the
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
challenges is um I believe there's only
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
about two companies in the state that
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
are providing transportation services to
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
school districts that don't own their
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
own buses so um it's not a very
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
competitive market for school districts
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the the superintendent and
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members that I've spoken to
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
that have negotiated Transportation
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
contracts over the last couple of years
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
um have have been over a barrel to be
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
quite honest with you because the
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
transportation company is saying this is
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
the cost this is this is what we're
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
charging you and if you don't want to
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
sign our contract the school district is
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
is up a creek and to your question about
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
um whether or not they could put the
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
transportation contract on as a separate
 
01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
warant warrant article um the risk with
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
that would be there are certain o
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation obligations that school
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
districts have to have to follow special
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
education as you mentioned
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
representative and RSA 189 col 6 states
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
that the local school district shall
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
furnish transportation to pupils in
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through eight through grade
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
eight who live more than two miles from
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
the school um so if the if the
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
transportation contract were to go on
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
the warrant as a separate warrant
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
article and was defeated I don't know
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
how that's rectified because you're not
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to appropriate money under that
 
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
contract then if the voters said no but
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
you still have statewide obligations to
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
transport kids for special education and
 
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
under and under this statute so you
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
could bifurcate that that contract
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
somehow but you'd have to go back and
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
company

01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.669 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:29:26.669 --> 01:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
T thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
taking our ongoing questions on this
 
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.070 align:start position:0%
taking our ongoing questions on this
item

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
um the default budget is
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
defined quite explicitly in the rsas on
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
what can go in and what
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
can't but
 
01:29:47.679 --> 01:29:49.310 align:start position:0%
can't but
um

01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
so aren't we kind
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
of it's already in in the budget so if
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
they get the default budget the money
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
that was allocated last year with the
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
school buses is already in
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
there are you are you saying that that
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
the voters well I suppose you could take
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
that line out at your public meetings
 
01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:18.590 align:start position:0%
that line out at your public meetings
but

01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
um but the other obviously makes up for
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
it as far as being
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
ired within Beyond two two miles and
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
special special circumstances but I
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
this already taken
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
care thank thank you for the question
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative um I guess I would
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
hearken back to Senator chandy's
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
testimony where she said in speaking
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
with one of the school districts in in
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
in her District in her in her Senate
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
District that they were either informed
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
or told or calculated the default budget
 
01:31:01.109 --> 01:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
absent some of the increased costs that
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
these new Transportation contracts are
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
costing I don't know specifically what
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
district Senator Chanley is referring to
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
but the fact that the bill was put in
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
place at the request of Van SA or a
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
school district because there were
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to Transportation
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
costs within the default budget I would
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
say that that's kind of why we're here
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
and why the bill was introduced and why
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
repes representative
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
lales thank you for taking my
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
question could you tell me in the the
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
current default budget
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
situation what transport Transportation
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
costs are allowed in that default budget
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative well in and so the as as
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
I presume most if not all the members of
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
the committee are aware of the default
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
budget includes in its in in in part of
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
its definition contracts and other
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
obligations previously incurred or man
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
mandated by law so special education
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
would be man special education
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation would be mandated by law
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
the transportation of pupils in grade in
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
grades kindergarten through grade 8 who
 
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
live more than two miles from school
 
01:32:20.189 --> 01:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
would be required by law a school
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
district however May provide
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
transportation to high school students
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
which is not required by law but yet
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be calculated into into a contract
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
with a transportation company likewise
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
the school district may also provide
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
transportation to pupils in grades
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grade 8 who live
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
less than two miles from school so I
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know if a could a business
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
manager or a superintendent of a school
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
district pinpoint where each child lives
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
and then ascertain or calculate a cost
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
per pupil and then that might be taken
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
out of the default budget
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
because you're only providing you'd only
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
be able to put in the default budget the
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
costs that are required by law the
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
special education and the for all the
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
children that are within the parameters
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
co16 goad followup it's my understanding
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
although there is this TW mile
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
rule that most school districts say if
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
you want to ride the bus we're going to
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
provide you a ride yeah to the school
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
01:33:27.199 --> 01:33:29.149 align:start position:0%
whether you
live

01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
um in our district we had one person one
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
student who lived directly across the
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
street from the school but the parent
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
requested right that the child be picked
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
up because they didn't want the child
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
walk across the
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
road so in that case where the school
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
district is providing
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
Transportation above and beyond what is
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
mandated is that included in the
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
current um default budget negotiations
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
or calculations yes thank you for the
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
question representa I'm not trying to be
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
evasive but I mean I certainly I can't
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
speak to 161 school districts on how
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
they're calculating their default budget
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
well less than that but for the sb2
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
towns let's say there's 100 school
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
districts that are sb2 I mean you know I
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
think I think many school districts
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
calculate them a little bit differently
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest with you depending on
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
the advice that they get from from
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps their own local attorney um I
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
will also tell you that I'm aware of
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
some school districts that will provide
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
High School transportation for high
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
school students but the parents also
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay some amount it's probably
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
not the full amount that covers it but
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of some school risks that will
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
say if you're high school whether you
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
live a mile from the school or 10 miles
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
from the school
 
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
that parents have to pay $100 a year or
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
something along those lines to help
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
defas some of those costs okay thank you
 
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.830 align:start position:0%
defas some of those costs okay thank you
thank

01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
you representative stavis thank you Mr
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
question this just a simple question I
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
think um is the origin of this bill the
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
um the problem of one SAU or is this a
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide issue thank you for the
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
question representative um
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that and and I know this
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get to the default budget
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
question I will tell you that Rising
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs are a Statewide
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
issue the default budget issue I can't I
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
can't specifically speak
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
to follow
 
01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
up so the factual answer to my question
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
is that you don't know is that correct I
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's fair enough
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you Mr chair
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for being here
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
and for all that you do for the school
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
districts um again my understanding is
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill would look into all those
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
cases in the towns and
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have transportation
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
cost in uh in their budgets and
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
study this situation because of the
 
01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:20.149 align:start position:0%
study this situation because of the
rapidly

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
changing fuel cost and other costs that
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
are pertaining to transportation that
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
they cannot foresee is that correct
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for the question
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
representative yes to to to some degree
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
that is why nhba is supporting the bill
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
aside from looking at the default budget
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
I believe I led some of my testimony was
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
saying I hope that perhaps that
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
conversation can also may not be the
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
direct purpose of that study commission
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
but hopefully that would come out in the
 
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
conversation of what are some of the
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
other drivers and what are some of the
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
other challenges school districts are
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation further
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that I have one yep um
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a 35,000 foot view philosophical
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh you seem to be very knowledgeable
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
about the situation uh the bill itself
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
has five senators and five house members
 
01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.709 align:start position:0%
has five senators and five house members
as

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors what is the need for yet
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
another study committee when we have the
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
expertise I would assume within at least
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
within the sponsorship yourself and
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
whoever else to actually work on it
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
yourselves and come forth with
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
legislation next year so thank for the
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
that that that that's a fair enough
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
question representative um you know the
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
school boards Association we have a a
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
continued working relationship with aund
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
100 superintendents across the state 100
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
business managers across the state um
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
again I I have spoken to Senator Chanley
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
about this bill I don't know what
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
specific SAU this is a derivative from I
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that offline if you
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
will or in the hallway and and and reach
 
01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
out to that particular School District
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
as well too and and and and and and
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps our own working group if you
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
will and then find somebody to sponsor
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
legislation next year thank you thank
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
much testimony we have one more pink
 
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Eric power I'm
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
from Brookline I'm also the president of
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
the school district governance
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
Association in support of this bill uh I
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
think this bill is important uh
 
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs have been going up
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of school districts
 
01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
including the the town I live in in
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
Brookline our K through 6 school
 
01:38:49.709 --> 01:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
district is
 
01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
sb2 and what needs to be in a default
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
budget what can't be there's some
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
language there in the law um but it's
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
there is some gray areas and so with
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation it's one of the key
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
things that the school district has to
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
fulfill um and it's important that you
 
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
under this is a complex problem so I
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
think it's it's appropriate for a uh
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
study committee to look at this you have
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
some saus about 75% of the saus in the
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
state are single District saus so this
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
the SA serves one school district you
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
have the other 25% of saus are
 
01:39:28.119 --> 01:39:29.430 align:start position:0%
have the other 25% of saus are
multi-district

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
multi-district
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
saus and among those some districts
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
decide to contract their transportation
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
individually and some contract them as
 
01:39:38.719 --> 01:39:39.629 align:start position:0%
individually and some contract them as
an

01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
SAU and bus contracts will range
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere from one year which is very
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
uncommon three to five years so that the
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
problem comes down when you have an
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing contract there's not going to be
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
a question if it's continuing what the
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
cost will be that would be put in the
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
default budget because you know the
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
contract is going on the question
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
happens when your contract runs out what
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
do you put in the default budget for the
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
next year because you don't have a
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
contract and that's a good question for
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
this committee to take a look at because
 
01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh there's a couple different
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
aspects to it in terms of you know
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
governance so I think that it is an
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
important committee but I'd also want to
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
give one caveat at that you know
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
transportation is one of the costs in a
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
school district but there can be other
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
things such as maybe the propane cost
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas costs o oil costs you don't
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
always have a contract with that those
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
are usually annual based on the market
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
so while we're looking at Transportation
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
if this if this committee uh gets formed
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
you want to also it might open up a
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of can of worms on what you
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
do with other things what you put in a
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
SP SP2 default budget
 
01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:57.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a contract and what is
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
not mandated by law that's a gray area
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
so um I think this committee could meet
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
and look at those things but you also
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
have to be aware there might be some
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
other areas especially for school
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
districts where this might be uh an
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
issue about how to clarify uh what's in
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
a default budget and I've I've looked at
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
default budgets closely myself I've
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
talked to representative yella I found
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
mistakes in default budgets where they
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
weren't find following the law um So and
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
I've also talked to Department of res
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration Dr and they say
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
the number one question they get during
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
budget season are questions about what's
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
in a default budget so if this would go
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
to any amount of helping get less calls
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
and less uh less Demand on Dr I think
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
they would greatly appreciate it if we
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
clarified this part of the law so I
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
think the committee would be a good
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
thing to do and see what it comes up
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
with considering all these factors and
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative y
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
Kella thank you uh thank you for taking
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
the question it's um the in my
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
municipality the recent um concern
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
regarding default budgets was why is the
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
state deciding what is and is not in the
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
default budget at all um why is the
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
state telling us what is in the default
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
budget and essentially making us pay for
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
maybe things that we wanted to remove
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
because we're we went to deliberative
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
session and and um so I guess my
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
is it seems like there's a just a lack
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
of communication or knowledge about this
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
and maybe actually there is no no fix
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
required for
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
transportation in in they just they
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
maybe the municipality just needed to be
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
advised that they need to put that
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
contract on the on the ballot and be uh
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
helped by a Dr to to formulated so the
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
known means no doesn't happen as far as
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
spending on it so I guess what
 
01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
purpose with
 
01:43:11.599 --> 01:43:13.109 align:start position:0%
purpose with
Transportation

01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
01:43:13.119 --> 01:43:14.830 align:start position:0%
Transportation
specifically

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
is is warranted in this
 
01:43:20.589 --> 01:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
aspect um since it seems like the
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
municipality if they're going to a
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
default budget has already spoken of
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
about they don't want the increased
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
costs or or they don't like the proposed
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
budget and and so why is why is are we
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
coming up with solutions to override
 
01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:36.679 align:start position:0%
those those voters I guess I think the
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think when
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
you get tob2 and what goes in the
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
default budget it is definitely a murky
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
area and I think that the transportation
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
question with school districts is
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
probably a very good case uh subject
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
area to look at some of these things
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
because you have sometimes you have a
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
contract for it sometimes it continues
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't and I think if you
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
look at that it might uncover some of
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
the other defects we have with the
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
default budget by looking at this case
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh if a if the study committee looks at
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure that they will see this as
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
a case example will help maybe inform
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
other s
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
SP2 um default budget questions that
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
certainly need to be looked at so I
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
think as a you know as a as a prime
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
example of what happens I think it would
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
be very useful to have that insight and
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
for people to hear the different issues
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
there to help you know not only solve
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
this Transportation but maybe even the
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
SP2 represent K thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so as you
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
know we're required in our Constitution
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
to provide an education um and that's a
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
financial number uh um well cherish okay
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
um my question is it seems that
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
transportation is part of that
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
requirement right like to get them there
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
how much of that money allocated goes to
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation do you do you know I'm
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure if I understand the
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
question well the the money that's
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
mandated that's come comes from the
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
state is any of that money used for
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
transportation there is adequacy Aid
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
that comes from the state so it's it's
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
up to the school district where where it
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
comes from there's a tax effort part of
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
the tax effort is going to be from the
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
state part of the tax effort will become
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
from the federal government in terms of
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
special education and other grants so
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
but that that defrays the tax effort and
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
the rest of them is paid by local
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so that's a bigger question
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know um you heard about you know the
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
Mandate is being more than two miles
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
away k through eight so if you have a a
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
co-op School District like I have a 7
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
through 12 Co-op School District should
 
01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't have SP2 but if somebody
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
did have SP2 should that be in the
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
default budget and right now they do put
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
it in the default budget if they have a
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
contract if the contract doesn't
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
continue I think it depends on who's
 
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
asking and who's looking at what's going
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
on in that school district and I think
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
that's a an area that's very gray right
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
now that people do you know what the
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
attorneys say and and so that's kind of
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
at further questions representative
 
01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:23.310 align:start position:0%
at further questions representative
Brown

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks Mr
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
power so I think I heard this at least
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
twice in your testimony that that this
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill is important because of the need to
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
straighten out the transportation issue
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
on the default budget but I I also think
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
that you said that there were a number
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
of other issues that need to be
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
addressed with the default budget
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
so and I I thought you alluded to the
 
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
fact that maybe the proposed committee
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
should address those too did I
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
misunderstand you I I think that could
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
be something that they would look at I
 
01:46:57.070 --> 01:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
think you know transportation is largely
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
driven by energy so if you look at
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
energy in terms of what do a school
 
01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.189 align:start position:0%
energy in terms of what do a school
district

01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
use um I've come across numerous warn
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
articles over the past few years where
 
01:47:08.669 --> 01:47:08.679 align:start position:0%
people are doing conversions from
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
propane to oil doing solar doing all
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of things and you know if you have
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
a market-based fuel like heating oil or
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
propane you know if the market goes up
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
the default budgets can have last years
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
so what are you going to do there it's
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
the same problem so it seems to me these
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
sorts of thorny problems should be
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
handled maybe the transportation piece
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
can handle that maybe the committee
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
could add that as another thing to look
 
01:47:37.390 --> 01:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
at you know these kinds of these kinds
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
of issues in school districts if if you
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
need to um I think that that would be
 
01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.750 align:start position:0%
need to um I think that that would be
some

01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
insight represent
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
kill um thank you Mr chair so you know
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
I'm reading line one right here
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee established there is an
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
established a committee to study the
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
inclusion of Transportation expenses in
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
default budgets I don't see anywhere in
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
this bill those other things you're
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
talking about so I don't think that
 
01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:05.990 align:start position:0%
talking about so I don't think that
the

01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee being proposed here would
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to do those things do do
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
you agree I agree that the the bill is
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
now yours and you guys you can make
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
amendments to it as you see fit based on
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances so that's what I would do
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
if I was on the committee um because
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is a challenging problem and it
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
could do a lot of good to look at all
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
SP2 issues F the
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions I have one Mr power it's the
 
01:48:36.669 --> 01:48:36.679 align:start position:0%
same question that I gave Mr Christina
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
you obviously have a lot of experience
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
and knowledge on this issue uh with the
 
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
School District Governor uh government
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
Association governing Association and uh
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Christina with the New Hampshire
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
Association Along with these sponsors
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
don't you believe that without forming
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
an actual committee you could actually
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
come forth with some legislation that
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
would take care of the issue that you're
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
all testifying
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
for I thank you for the question I think
 
01:49:06.910 --> 01:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
that could be possible I don't I think
 
01:49:08.189 --> 01:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
without a committee though there
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be the priority on it
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
that would happen in sort of an ad hoc
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
manner we do do a lot of legislation ad
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
hoc but I think there you know this is a
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
rare circumstance where you see an
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with a couple of different
 
01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:23.070 align:start position:0%
agreement with a couple of different
associations

01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
associations
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think that having this committee
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
look at this it is a challenging issue I
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
think it's going to require some
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
research behind it I don't think any
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
single party has all the answers but it
 
01:49:37.229 --> 01:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
could be done will it happen on its own
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think it
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
would and I have a followup for myself
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
um you just mentioned exactly my point
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh you're your two associations are
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
generally I would assume not in
 
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
agreement where you have an agreement
 
01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.310 align:start position:0%
agreement where you have an agreement
here

01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
I would think that would be the perfect
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you all to use your
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
expertise to get together and actually
 
01:50:01.629 --> 01:50:01.639 align:start position:0%
come up with some good legislation
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's a comment you can answer it's not
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
really a question but um you know we we
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
have hundreds of these study committees
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly I've seen more action
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
and I uh legislation good leg
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
legislation come out of um groups
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
getting together as ad Hawk than I have
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
as actual committee so that would be my
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
only comment on that further comments
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%

I have for your consideration this
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
morning Senate Bill 532 relative to
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
requiring all municipalities and school
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
governing bodies to post on their
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
official town or School website within
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
30 days the amount of funds received by
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
the state either by allocation or Grant
 
01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
um you might ask where does this come
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
from and this bill really comes from me
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
talking with my constituents one of the
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
things that many of us if not all of us
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
do is when we go home we like to talk to
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
our constituents about what we've done
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
in conquered and what we've done to help
 
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
them make their lives better and we had
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
a great budget last year very
 
01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:19.719 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and one of the things I like
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
to talk about is that bipartisan budget
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
but also about how much money we've
 
01:53:27.629 --> 01:53:27.639 align:start position:0%
returned to the taxpayers for property
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
tax relief and of course the response I
 
01:53:33.310 --> 01:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
usually get is what
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
relief where well I don't I didn't see
 
01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
my property taxes go down and so I
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
started thinking about well what's the
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
best way to inform our constituents when
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
we send money back to the towns and we
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
do it in a variety of different ways so
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
um I met with the municipal ipal
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
Association and I talked to some of my
 
01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
colleagues I and I talked with my uh
 
01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
town government in londondary said maybe
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
the best thing to do is basically every
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
time you get money from the state put it
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
up on the town website let the people
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
know that you're receiving this money
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
and you could even make it even sweeter
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
by telling them what you intend to do
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
with it but at least this way the people
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
can see that we are giving them money
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
back that they can use in a variety of
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
and hopefully this will spur
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
conversations between citizens and their
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
town government and be a way for them to
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
be more involved so again Mr chair this
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
bill is is I always hate to say fairly
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
simple because usually when you say that
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
some people will see it as pretty
 
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
complicated but um it's just asking them
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
to put just very simply put it up on
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
their town website the amount of money
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're getting for us both on the
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
school side and from um on the town side
 
01:54:55.589 --> 01:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
01:54:57.510 --> 01:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I would make the
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
comment that you're right A lot of times
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
when somebody says it's very simple it
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
turns out to be one of the most
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
complicated I believe this is fairly
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
simple representative Gallagher I saw
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.669 align:start position:0%
your hand
up

01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
um so it on lines five to six it says in
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
the absence of a website a political
 
01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:21.639 align:start position:0%
division shall post the information in
 
01:55:24.030 --> 01:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
two appr apprpriate places could you go
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
into a bit more detail about um what is
 
01:55:29.950 --> 01:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
meant by appropriate
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
places okay thank you very much for the
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
question uh representative um this
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
language was added um because of
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
concerns that the municipal Association
 
01:55:43.069 --> 01:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
had we have a number of very small towns
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
here in our beautiful state and some of
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
them they don't have a web page so they
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
will post it in two places that they
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.069 align:start position:0%
will post it in two places that they
feel

01:55:53.069 --> 01:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:55:55.109 --> 01:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
are appropriate they could have a Town
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
Newspaper they could put it as a notice
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
in the town newspaper or they could put
 
01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
a notice up at Town Hall um it's going
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
to be up to them to decide which places
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate representative yella thank
 
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you for uh taking the question
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
um as a member of the budget committee
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
um is my understanding in my local
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
municipality it's my understanding that
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
money going to the school often come if
 
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding how how it works the
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
money actually flows directly to the
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
municipality and the municipality cuts
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
the school a check and so um so if that
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
is the case would the um the school not
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
need to to post it would just be the
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
municipality that got the money directly
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
from the uh state if it was for like a
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know a refund or
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
something I I think I I really didn't
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
thank you qu for the question
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
representative I really did not want to
 
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
micromanage this process other than to
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
say you've got to post it to let people
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
know that this money is coming back to
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
you and really it's up to the
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities how they're going to
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
spend that money but at least we've
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
taken a step and we've said we're giving
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
you this money back or you're getting
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
this much money per pupil or you're
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
getting a sustainability grant for the
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
schools because most people really don't
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
know that and sometimes that information
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
is really buried in town reports I don't
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
know about you folks when you go to your
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
town deliberative sessions but our books
 
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
are about that thick and it if you don't
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
know exactly what you're looking for
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
you're not to find it so this way you're
 
01:57:55.629 --> 01:57:55.639 align:start position:0%
taking that information and you're
 
01:57:58.589 --> 01:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
putting it up there uh in a very simple
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
format um to let people
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
know representative
 
01:58:05.750 --> 01:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I think I
 
01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
heard in your testimony that you said
 
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
that this information would be posted on
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
the website indicating how much money
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
they received from the state and I
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
thought you said that also how that
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
money was going to be used I don't see
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
that in the bill about how it's
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
allocated thank you for the question I I
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
believe that I said it's going to be up
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
to them to decide if they want to add
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
additional information including how the
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
money is to be used thank
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
you rep uh representative
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this says um on
 
01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:46.069 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this says um on
line

01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:50.679 align:start position:0%
five that this um notice will be posted
 
01:58:54.149 --> 01:58:54.159 align:start position:0%
to the website Within 30 days of receipt
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say for how long it needs
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
posted or archived for example do
 
01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
you see it in perpetuity on the on the
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
website I thank you for the question
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative again I did not want to
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
micromanage the process at the Town
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
level um it should pretty much be up to
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
them how long they want to keep it up um
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
or if they want to Archive it but I
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
would think that I I don't want to say
 
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
anything else because I I don't I'm not
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
in town government um and I believe
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
every District might have their own
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
policy and again I really did not want
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
to micromanage this thank you uh rep
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you Mr
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
taking a question which I think the
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer might be our discretion but
 
01:59:49.830 --> 01:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
Northampton just was awarded what
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
Northampton is going to be the the
 
01:59:54.910 --> 01:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
recipient of work from the new Hamp from
 
01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
a grant given to the New Hampshire
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to fix all
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
the damage from the last storms that we
 
02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
had I in there that means we are not
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to spend our money but the
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
grant money is not coming to the town I
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
imagine that might be something we're
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to celebrate anyway but you would
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
say I I imagine the answer to this would
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
be use your discretion about how you
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
want to post that to the
 
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
community okay again thank you for the
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
question representative yes I again I
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
micromanage each Community is different
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
they handle information differently and
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
I don't in many instances I don't
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
believe a one-size fits-all is is really
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
good representative
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
you senator for um taking my question so
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate this this bill and it
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an interesting and a good
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
idea my concern is I know in my SAU they
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
bury information and that would be
 
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
contrary to what you're the purpose of
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
the spill is you literally have to be
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
Nancy Drew I just it's impossible to
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
find any information so I was wondering
 
02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
I understand that you don't want a
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
micromanage and one size doesn't fit all
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
I is there any solution because this is
 
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
important information would you be open
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
or do you have any ideas as to how we
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
could address that so that the you know
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
our constituents and the members of the
 
02:01:25.629 --> 02:01:25.639 align:start position:0%
public can access that important
 
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
information thank you representative for
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
the question I see this as a first step
 
02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
I think there needs to be a my personal
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
opinion is there needs to be a lot more
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
communication between either a town
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
counsil or whatever form of government
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
you have and a school board and the
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
citizens um I recently found out that um
 
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
often times a school superintendent will
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
um apply for a grant from the federal
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
government and the Schoolboard members
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't even know they won't know so again
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
I see this as a first step in maybe
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
getting people to start talking to each
 
02:02:09.069 --> 02:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
other um at the local level and just and
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
I I agree that a lot of times
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
information is deeply buried in
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
documents and this is just made to be
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
very simple very clear very transparent
 
02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they'll if this does pass
 
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
um people will see that this kind of
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
information being made a lot more
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
readily available is a great opportunity
 
02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
to engage citizens in local
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
government representative priest I saw
 
02:02:34.239 --> 02:02:35.109 align:start position:0%
government representative priest I saw
your

02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Carson we go back a long way
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
for 20 years thank you for being here
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for um sponsoring this
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill as I read it this is very simple
 
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're just increasing the transp
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
parency M between the state and the
 
02:02:58.069 --> 02:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
local governments um and the people in
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
the local governments so they know
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're doing and what
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
programs you are adopting and bringing
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
back to to
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
them is that correct thank you for the
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
question representative yes it is
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
um you know um just so you know
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative priest and I served for
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
many years together when he was the
 
02:03:23.069 --> 02:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
executive director of the Southern New
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Planning Commission and I was
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
one of London der's representatives to
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
that commission but um you have to start
 
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
someplace and I think this is a good
 
02:03:36.669 --> 02:03:36.679 align:start position:0%
place to start we send a lot of money
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
back to our communities but the one
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
thing we don't do is we really don't
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
tell them how do you how you're supposed
 
02:03:45.149 --> 02:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
to spend this money we leave it up to
 
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
them to
 
02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
decide and this is just one step to just
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
to say look this is what we're sending
 
02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
back to you you folks need to have the
 
02:03:55.950 --> 02:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
conversation about where you think the
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
spent representative yell thank you um
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
just imagining this this kind of
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
implementation and how different
 
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities might do this you know
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
one municipality might might just put um
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
like a a lottery ticker up in the corner
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
of their thing that just has the amount
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
received from the state right where it's
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's not even broken down by the amounts
 
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
received just the total sum whereas
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
others might D list each individual
 
02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
check that they receive from the state
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
um you you want that uh to be able to be
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
that flexible to to be able to comply
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
with this law to be able to like post it
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
in any way any manner that they they see
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
fit thank you representative um I
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
strongly believe in local control and it
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
is up to the municipality to decide how
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
they want to do this um if they start
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing it and they start getting a lot of
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
feedback from their uh citizens maybe
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
they can they'll make their own changes
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
I just don't think that we should be
 
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
telling them exactly how to do
 
02:05:12.830 --> 02:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
gallager um
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
so I I'm wondering um so does this apply
 
02:05:23.870 --> 02:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
um allocations or grants for public
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
school or does it also apply to um
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
Charters and education Freedom accounts
 
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
it applies to all the money that we send
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
back to either a school the school
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
district or the
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
town if that is included then that's
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to be reported as
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
lales thank you Senator Carson
 
02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
um towns all across the state and all
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
across the nation quite
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
frankly uh recently got arpa
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
funds from the federal
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
government and it sort of
 
02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
put Selectmen town
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
councils what are we going to do with
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
these and what how can we spend
 
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:23.719 align:start position:0%
these and and I know in our particular
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
case one of the things that we did was
 
02:06:30.430 --> 02:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
we bought a fire engine that was very
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
needed MH all right now if you went to
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
the people of the country and said how
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
did you spend arpa funds I think a lot
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
of people would really scratch their
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
head there was a lot of money that came
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that was
 
02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.790 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that was
spent

02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
spent
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh and it was sort of left up to the
 
02:06:59.069 --> 02:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
local people to to do that so would you
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
say that in in the case of this
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
particular Bill you're saying for funds
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
that are coming from the
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
state particularly unanticipated funds
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
some some funds are anticipated but
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
others are unanticipated mhm yep so
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
those I I would hope that when we uh
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
implement this that we we would make
 
02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:31.549 align:start position:0%
implement this that we we would make
that

02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
differentiation between what is
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated what was budgeted for but
 
02:07:41.229 --> 02:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
then what was kind of extra money all
 
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
right and that's extra
 
02:07:49.350 --> 02:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
money really has the potential of
 
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
lowering local property taxes and I
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
think that's the target it's it's the
 
02:07:59.709 --> 02:07:59.719 align:start position:0%
money let's say that the state has extra
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
funds and they bring it they shoot it
 
02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
back to the towns and we're really
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
hoping that there there will be some
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
relief but if the town doesn't choose to
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
spend it that way then it doesn't end up
 
02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
being property tax relief
 
02:08:24.510 --> 02:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense to you yes
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative I hear exactly what
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying and this is the beauty of
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
our our government the arpa funds came
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
from the federal government but were
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
dispersed through the state most
 
02:08:39.149 --> 02:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities really didn't know or or
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
the people how much money their
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
municipality was getting if this Bill
 
02:08:47.549 --> 02:08:47.559 align:start position:0%
had been passed they would have known so
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
it can facilitate a conversation because
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
now people can see oh we've got so much
 
02:08:57.069 --> 02:08:57.079 align:start position:0%
money coming into the state whether it's
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated or
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
unanticipated and I'm gonna go out on a
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
limb here because I'm remembering London
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
Derry there was a time when we received
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
unanticipated funds we had to hold a
 
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
special meeting to decide how to spend
 
02:09:13.229 --> 02:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
the that money and I want to say that
 
02:09:16.109 --> 02:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
there's an RSA that requires that but
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in Municipal law so
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
please take that with a grain of salt
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave that up to you folks
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
but the point is people will know that
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
the money is there they've received it
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
at that point have a conversation with
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
your community and say what are you
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
going to spend this money
 
02:09:40.549 --> 02:09:40.559 align:start position:0%
on because again most people don't even
 
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
know they have no clue how much they get
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
thank you reprentative
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
Tetra thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
senator for being with us today
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question on on the
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
wording where it states that
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
the uh requiring municipalities and
 
02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
school governing bodies to I'm sorry
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry I can't hear
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
you because there's a lot of
 
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
construction noise no
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
really I was going to say be careful
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
when you go out because you're going to
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
walk into this huge cloud of dust
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
outside in a very big machine
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to speak up
 
02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:27.639 align:start position:0%
or get in between the
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
crashes um the it looks to me as
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
if this the municipality or or School
 
02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
if this the municipality or or School
governing

02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
governing
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
bodies both get noticed about the money
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
coming through are the taxpayers and
 
02:10:48.510 --> 02:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
they both post it are the taxpayers
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to be looking for double the money
 
02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
going to be looking for double the money
because

02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
the town said they got it and the school
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
district said they got
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative I don't believe so um I
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
think our our folks that are working at
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the municipal level will be able to make
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
that distinction because they're come
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
the money although it's coming from the
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
state one's coming through the
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the other's
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the Department of State
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's from Transportation HHS or
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
any other department so I think they're
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
iction okay seeing no more hands raised
 
02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson you are relieved thank
 
02:11:32.549 --> 02:11:32.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman see I said I thought it
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
was simple but it wasn't I got a lot of
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
questions and that's a good thing yeah
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing very good thank you
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
all very much for your time this this
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you you have two more
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
hello my name's Eric power again I'm I'm
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
from Brookline I'm in support of this
 
02:11:59.549 --> 02:11:59.559 align:start position:0%
bill um I think it's really important
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
from a transparence transparency
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
perspective for towns and school
 
02:12:04.669 --> 02:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
districts to say what money they're
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
getting I I I'm one of those Hardy Boys
 
02:12:09.870 --> 02:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever you okay that goes in looks
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
at these things in detail um so I know
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
where to find it but people say how do
 
02:12:15.750 --> 02:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
you do that and it's actually something
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
you have to it's a skill but it
 
02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to be a skill where you
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
have to really hunt for things um we get
 
02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in the town people aren't
 
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
aware of it uh I mentioned I I served on
 
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
our Co-op School Board I actually
 
02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
suggested this one time to the school
 
02:12:32.189 --> 02:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
district at the school board and they
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
says why can't we tell them we get this
 
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
money well people will figure it out
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
they can read it in the town report and
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm like well we should make it a little
 
02:12:42.310 --> 02:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
more prominent I mean as legislators you
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
do a lot of great work here you pass
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
budgets it even for yourselves it would
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
be great to know what's coming from
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
conquered uh cuz people don't generally
 
02:12:53.549 --> 02:12:53.559 align:start position:0%
know and this would definitely make it
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
more prominent um serving on the
 
02:12:58.669 --> 02:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
planning board in Brookline we've gotten
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
some grants we got a grant to do a
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
hydrological study we had another Grant
 
02:13:07.629 --> 02:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
to do some planning uh for uh for
 
02:13:11.069 --> 02:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
housing Workforce housing and we had we
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
people look in this and they say you
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
guys spent a lot of money but that was a
 
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
grant we had gotten from the state and
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
people just aren't aware they think
 
02:13:18.270 --> 02:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
we're just spending money that we don't
 
02:13:21.189 --> 02:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
have but we got this money so you you
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
know I said yeah we got this as a grant
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
um and so people aren't aware of that so
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
um with Esser funds coming into school
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
districts with arpa funds coming in it
 
02:13:32.669 --> 02:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
just makes a whole lot of sense to have
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
this and I I think this is a good first
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
step I think that you know M
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts will
 
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
um implement this the way they want but
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
I think you know the consumers of it are
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
going to say if it it doesn't meet their
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
needs they're probably going to say we
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
know we want you to break that down a
 
02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
little more or we' really like to say
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
what you think you're going to use it on
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
um but I think just from a transparency
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't think it's a good
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
big burden on school districts in towns
 
02:14:01.229 --> 02:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
to do this and it might even help them
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
to see you know what money they're
 
02:14:05.229 --> 02:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
getting and how they're trying to do
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
their job as the governing bodies of
 
02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:10.119 align:start position:0%
their towns and school districts so I
 
02:14:12.629 --> 02:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good bill I would uh
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
recommend this passage and um I'll take
 
02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:16.990 align:start position:0%
recommend this passage and um I'll take
any

02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank for your testimony
 
02:14:22.189 --> 02:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative Yella thank you thank you
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
so in the last speaker they're like all
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
about local control and we're going to
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
be seeing this information kind of
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
dispersed throughout a bunch of
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
different websites maybe posted here
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
posted there um you know if they don't
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
have a website it seems like that the
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
all this information is at the state
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
since the state is paying municipalities
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't uh
 
02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:59.310 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't uh
more

02:14:59.310 --> 02:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh better place to house this
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
information be on the State website so
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
that you could see all of the minicipal
 
02:15:10.549 --> 02:15:10.559 align:start position:0%
all you could break it down and we could
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
we could break it down as much or as
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
little as we wanted to and then the
 
02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
information is just there all in one
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
place instead of having to hunt andek
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
and and try and track down what the
 
02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
method or you know back page that you
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
know five five links deep on your
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal website of where the the money
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
is actually um getting reported
 
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
out that's interesting but you know even
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
at the state level you have different
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
organizations getting it and I think
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
most people the average citizen doesn't
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
go to the state websites maybe some do
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's common but a
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
lot more people tend to go to their
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
local municipality website their local
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
municip it uh the local school district
 
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
website so I think you know and they can
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
present it the way that makes sense
 
02:16:00.589 --> 02:16:00.599 align:start position:0%
locally um I would rather I would you
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
know I think that's an interesting idea
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
that might be something that could be
 
02:16:05.669 --> 02:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
considered but I do think you know
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
putting the information down at the
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
local level makes a lot of sense and if
 
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted to augment it for example as
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh the senator had mentioned they could
 
02:16:17.470 --> 02:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
augment we got these we got these um
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
arpa funds and I know in our town I
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
didn't know this until I asked some
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
questions they're going to use arpa
 
02:16:25.229 --> 02:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
funds to buy some voting machines wow no
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
one knew that just I found that out in
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
passing but they could augment that at
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
the local level so if the state had it
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
they could say they gave us the arpa
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
funds for you know $30,000 but it
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be have the
 
02:16:38.669 --> 02:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
information locally that we're going to
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
plan on using 25,000 of that for two
 
02:16:43.389 --> 02:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
voting machines for example so there's
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
some pluses and minuses there but I
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
concept further questions
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much for your
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr PR and one last pink card
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
up thank you again chairman turock good
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
uh afternoon I guess at this point uh
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
members of the committee bar Christina
 
02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Schoolboard
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
Association um we're not taking a
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we don't have any
 
02:17:20.190 --> 02:17:20.200 align:start position:0%
specific objection to it but I just
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight to the committee
 
02:17:24.429 --> 02:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
that um the information that is sought
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
to be posted on the school district
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
website is already available in a
 
02:17:31.629 --> 02:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
multitude of places um it's uh listed in
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
the annual report the school district
 
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
annual report that is required under
 
02:17:39.429 --> 02:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
both RSA 198 and RSA 32 um the
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has um a a
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
program what is called I platform um
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
every bit of data that school districts
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
are required to submit is available on
 
02:17:52.830 --> 02:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
the the the the the state department of
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
education's website everything from
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
state aid that's given um to student
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
Dropout numbers attendance numbers
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores every bit of data
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that you could possibly want about
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
your local school district is listed on
 
02:18:08.349 --> 02:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
that um which is housed and created by
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
the department of education's um uh on
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education's website um
 
02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would want to
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
clarify um as well too is um state
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants your the money that's
 
02:18:25.629 --> 02:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
distributed to schools um is distributed
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
to the school districts four times per
 
02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
year September 1st November 15th no I'm
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
sorry uh September 1st um November 1st
 
02:18:39.389 --> 02:18:39.399 align:start position:0%
January 1st and April 1st as I read the
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
statute you would have to update your
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
website those four times a year that's
 
02:18:47.309 --> 02:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
fine I suppose but the reality is by
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
October 1st districts know how much
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
money they're getting for the by
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
November first I believe it is how much
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
money they're getting for the for the
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
course of the year the one question that
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
I do have Rel and this came up a little
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
bit with some conversations about some
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the the eser money some of the
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
federal grants um the language States
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
the public body shall I'm on line four
 
02:19:10.469 --> 02:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
shall post the amount of funds received
 
02:19:13.389 --> 02:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
by the state either through allocation
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
or Grant is this intended to apply only
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
to state grants and State money um
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
school districts receive all sorts of
 
02:19:28.110 --> 02:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
federal grants special education grants
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
um other grants from other federal
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
agencies that you know a school district
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
might apply for um and it's sort of pass
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
through money uh uh they may apply
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
through a special Grant through the
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
department through the US Department of
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
Education but that money comes into the
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education and then
 
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
is allocated to the local school
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
district so that's not State money but
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's being received by the state so just
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
one clarification on whether or not the
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to apply to just State
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
money or money that is federal money but
 
02:20:02.349 --> 02:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
passed through money that is then moves
 
02:20:04.270 --> 02:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
on to the the district or the or the
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
municipality so um in the interest of
 
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
transparency absolutely the more
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
information we can post on our website
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for for members of
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
the public to to access and an easy to
 
02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
read format and not buried on you know
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
some 10th page that you have to access
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's all well good um but just wanted
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
to point out that the information is
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
available in a multitude of other places
 
02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
um and a multitude of of of other
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
websites um and the one question I have
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
about line four and with that happy to
 
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
may have thank you any questions
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative y Kell thank you
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
um if would it be more clear if it was
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
just essentially a page on the on the
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
treasure the New Hampshire treasurer's
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
website so any check essentially they've
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
written to the municipality then that
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
that would be essentially meet the
 
02:21:02.349 --> 02:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill without burdening
 
02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality right with tracking
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
down like what who where did this money
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
officially come from and all of that
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff um do you think that that
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
would be a better solution yeah thank
 
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
you for the for the question
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative I hadn't contemplated
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
that till you asked the question to the
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
to the preview speaker I think that's
 
02:21:21.990 --> 02:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
certain certainly worth consideration um
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
there is also another bill I forget the
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill number that was heard in House
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
Education yesterday that would have
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
required the district to the school
 
02:21:32.230 --> 02:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
district to post all sorts of financial
 
02:21:34.990 --> 02:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
information and data on the school
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
district's website and one
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation that was brought up by a
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
school superintendent was link your
 
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
school I mentioned the I platform that
 
02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
is that is that is um hosted on the
 
02:21:49.030 --> 02:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
department of education's website maybe
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
the district has to post their specific
 
02:21:52.990 --> 02:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
link the conquered school district will
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
post the conquered School District data
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
through the State website on the
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
conquered School District website I
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
think that would be perhaps an easier
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
solution perhaps in line with what
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about representative
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
rather than you know every month we get
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
a new Grant in or every four times a
 
02:22:08.510 --> 02:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
year we got our adequacy Aid in
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to up update the website
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
and not that that's a huge lift but it's
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
another administrative task that we
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
would be be having to to undergo perhaps
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
year for the questions I have one you
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
hit on an uh an area I had a question on
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
and that is federal funding M does let's
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
say a school
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
district any federal money goes through
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
the state not directly to the school
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay yes thank you
 
02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:42.630 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay yes thank you
further

02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%

02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
in the 234 cities and towns in New
 
02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I apologize that I was
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
unable to hear prior testimony or if I
 
02:23:26.429 --> 02:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
am redundant please feel free to stop me
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
so I can be brief could you pull that
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
mic a little close to your mouth please
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you yes of course so feel free to
 
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
stop me if anything is being repeated
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
that you've already heard I don't want
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
to waste anybody's time um I had met
 
02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor of the the bill
 
02:23:40.510 --> 02:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
originally in the summer who was looking
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
for some clarity around when cities and
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
towns and schools receive their funds
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
versus when they are reported to the
 
02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
public um we did go through all the
 
02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
different various documents that towns
 
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
would provide to their taxpayers so that
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
they do see these funds so the Dr Ms 636
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
for example contains all state aid
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
federal grants um any one-time payments
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
that report um is filed with the state
 
02:24:10.349 --> 02:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
but of course it is filed um at a
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
certain point in the year we also have
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
our annual report as you've all seen in
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
your own communities that's required by
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
law and the funds would be reported
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
there as well um the LBA the legislative
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
budget assistant will also do a report
 
02:24:29.110 --> 02:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
that is broken down not only in the
 
02:24:30.670 --> 02:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
large amount of money the overall
 
02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
allocation provided to cities and towns
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
but they will break every Grant down on
 
02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
their website usually about seven months
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
later after the budget passes for
 
02:24:43.269 --> 02:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
example or they update it usually in May
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
of every year and every single community
 
02:24:47.269 --> 02:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
that receives funding it will be broken
 
02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
down so while we can see the funding in
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
various places it is not reported
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
quickly so when you all pass the budget
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we receive funding or perhaps you
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
have given us a one-time payment which
 
02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
we've seen quite a bit of one-time
 
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
funding I'll give you a very specific
 
02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
example the highway block grant we
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
receive four payments a year from the
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
state it's reported in our annual report
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's also reported in um our Dr report
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
so they can be found in both places as
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
well as the LBA however when you gave us
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
the one-time payments we
 
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
you voted in May the end of May to
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
approve the budget we had the onetime
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
funding and we didn't find out our
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
allocations until just the following
 
02:25:31.870 --> 02:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
December we so we could kind of have
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
estimates but we didn't have those
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts till December so they may
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
or may not um depending on timing even
 
02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
make it into that annual report just
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
based on when the state decides that
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to release the funding meals
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and rooms is another great example we
 
02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
have benefited greatly from the new
 
02:25:50.670 --> 02:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
formula that you have all approved and
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
we thank you very much for that but we
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
do not know until we set the tax rate
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
what the meals and rooms amount will be
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
so it's the state treasurer provides the
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
number to the Dr and by October 1st but
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
cities and towns until they call the Dr
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
to set their tax rate are not made aware
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
of what that number is the report is
 
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
then put on the treasurer's website once
 
02:26:16.429 --> 02:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
all tax rates are set so towns don't
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
have this information in advance so this
 
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
was a compromise with the sponsor
 
02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
so that when we do become aware of these
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
dollars whatever they are that we can
 
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
then report them to the public on on the
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
website or in a newspaper if no website
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
is available so I hope that gives you a
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
little background as to how we how we
 
02:26:36.429 --> 02:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
got here thank you uh from your
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm assuming the nhma is in
 
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
favor of this you didn't say from the
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
beginning so we are we are neutral
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
neutal on the bill um thank
 
02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
you questions representative Hicks thank
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um thank you you for
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
taking the question would it do you
 
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
think in your it would
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
be could you pull that mic a little
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
closer to you please do you think it
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be um better for
 
02:27:03.389 --> 02:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities to add something into
 
02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
this bill that might
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
say online for
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
um body shall
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
post or provide a link to the amount of
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
funds per um representative y Kell's
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
comments about linking to other websites
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
oh and I apologize I I didn't hear I I
 
02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
think that could be a a great suggestion
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
because there are plenty of other places
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
Dees for example when we get a grant if
 
02:27:33.790 --> 02:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's a specific Grant to a municipality
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
that will be on their website do there's
 
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
so many places this information exists
 
02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think the sponsor's intent for
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I don't wish to put
 
02:27:46.710 --> 02:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
words in anyone's mouth is to make sure
 
02:27:49.269 --> 02:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers and the public knew
 
02:27:52.110 --> 02:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
when you are vote to give us money that
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
they were able to see it in closer to
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
real time to when we're receiving it I
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
think that was the intent of the bill so
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
I think a link um could could be
 
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate as well it's whatever you
 
02:28:04.269 --> 02:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
see fit other states actually have a
 
02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
State website where you can put in the
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
town and it's updated regularly and I
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
have examples of that it's called the
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
cherry sheet for example in our
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the South um so you can see
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
constantly what what new Aid might be
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
coming into a community but this is a
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
different way um that we would be
 
02:28:22.349 --> 02:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
handling it here in New Hampshire a
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
different way to solve the same
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
issue further questions comments
 
02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um the sheet
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
that you were just mentioning
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
um cherry cherry sheet yes yeah um is
 
02:28:42.910 --> 02:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
that if you know do you know if that is
 
02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh maintained by the state treasurer on
 
02:28:47.710 --> 02:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
on the state treasurer's website or is
 
02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
it its own dedicated website how how was
 
02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:51.150 align:start position:0%
it its own dedicated website how how was
that

02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
um administered I I believe it's their
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
budget office that that handles it and
 
02:28:57.990 --> 02:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
they they compile the information coming
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
from the different places but I'm happy
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
to I I have a copy I'll give it to you
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has several states have it
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we and we do maintain this the LBA
 
02:29:09.309 --> 02:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
will update it every May and October so
 
02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
we can go to the lb's website and get
 
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
get these documents broken down by
 
02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
Community or by school district with the
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
aid provided to them but it's only
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
updated twice a year like our annual
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
reports are updated once a year so I
 
02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
think this was looking to solve a a
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
different um a different
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
concern further
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
testimony thank I have no more pink
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
cards uh with that we will close the
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
hearing on SP
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
532 okay

03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
here as the sponsor of Senate Bill 491
 
03:14:53.229 --> 03:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for being a few minutes
 
03:14:55.150 --> 03:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
late we weren't sure when you were folks
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
were coming back so thank you for your
 
03:15:01.269 --> 03:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
forbearance um this is a constituent
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
request that came as a result of um an
 
03:15:07.550 --> 03:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
issue in the town of
 
03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
issue in the town of
Wakefield

03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
Wakefield
 
03:15:13.469 --> 03:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
um it deals with private road agreements
 
03:15:16.469 --> 03:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
and the bill is trying to make clear
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
that municipalities may enter into
 
03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
agreements to maintain a private road
 
03:15:25.510 --> 03:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
without having to be
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
responsible um for the long-term
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
obligation of upgra upgrading that road
 
03:15:35.389 --> 03:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
so I think um as you will hear from my
 
03:15:38.670 --> 03:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
constituent there was some concern about
 
03:15:41.349 --> 03:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
um on one of the lakes in Wakefield Road
 
03:15:44.429 --> 03:15:44.439 align:start position:0%
not being maintained the impact on water
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
quality and the town apparently was Will
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
only to maintain it but the status of
 
03:15:53.469 --> 03:15:53.479 align:start position:0%
the law if they start maintaining it
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
then they are
 
03:15:58.750 --> 03:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
responsible um for the long-term upkeep
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
of it so the bill continues to say that
 
03:16:03.950 --> 03:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
a municipality has to be responsible for
 
03:16:06.510 --> 03:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
getting the written consent of every
 
03:16:10.510 --> 03:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
owner um and it would have to be in
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
clear um language as to what they were
 
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do and the Department of
 
03:16:18.670 --> 03:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation adopt rues so hopefully a
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
very simple Bill and um thank you very
 
03:16:26.990 --> 03:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
much represent of power question thank
 
03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you president
 
03:16:31.630 --> 03:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
Bradley for taking my question so I I
 
03:16:35.070 --> 03:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
may be a little confused um I thought
 
03:16:36.510 --> 03:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
that I heard that you say that the
 
03:16:38.429 --> 03:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
purpose of this was this bill was with
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
regards to maintaining the road however
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
in line four that I see that it says
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
that the the agreement pertains to
 
03:16:50.110 --> 03:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
allowing the municipality to use the
 
03:16:54.269 --> 03:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
road and and that um was how the senate
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
committee amended it and I think that
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
constituent but it further says in the
 
03:17:07.309 --> 03:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
end of line four to five it does not
 
03:17:09.790 --> 03:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
obligate the municipality to maintain
 
03:17:14.590 --> 03:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
the road so that that is the
 
03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
point hopefully did you have
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
a if you have a yes follow follow up go
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
ahead so so I do see that the the um
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
agreement is with regard to the use of
 
03:17:29.950 --> 03:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
the road and then it says further lines
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
four and five that the agreement shall
 
03:17:34.630 --> 03:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
not obligate the municipality to
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
maintain the road that's correct however
 
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
is there um the ability for that
 
03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:43.389 align:start position:0%
is there um the ability for that
agreement

03:17:43.389 --> 03:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps if the roads being used could
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
there be a mutual agreement that the
 
03:17:51.229 --> 03:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
municipality might also maintain the
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
road and that is it it just as I
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
understand it it would allow more
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the case that there you
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
know is
 
03:18:04.110 --> 03:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
um some issue on a private road that the
 
03:18:07.710 --> 03:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
town for whatever reason in an agreement
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
with the property owners would maintain
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
it because of maybe through traffic
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
maybe an impact on a water body
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
something like that but it would not
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
obligation representative stavis did you
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a question uh yes and it's actually
 
03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
a followup on representative Powers
 
03:18:30.510 --> 03:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
question I understand that this is an
 
03:18:34.870 --> 03:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill to utilize
 
03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
the word use the road instead of
 
03:18:42.269 --> 03:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
maintain the road but how um will
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
future legislative bodies in
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities be able to differentiate
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
between maintenance and use those are
 
03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
two very different
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
things I think what words here mean
 
03:18:56.910 --> 03:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
everything and I wonder if you'd agree
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
with that and you know what I think um
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let Mr Robbins my
 
03:19:03.710 --> 03:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
constituent from Wakefield try to answer
 
03:19:05.189 --> 03:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
that because he's the one that brought
 
03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
this to
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
me representative y
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
Kell thank you uh thank you for taking
 
03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
the question so it seems like the the
 
03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
way youve presented this bill to us is
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
that somewhere in statute essentially if
 
03:19:24.670 --> 03:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
you start maintaining a road then the
 
03:19:28.030 --> 03:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
municipality is on the hook forever
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
however this is a new section of Law and
 
03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
actually repealing and replacing some
 
03:19:40.030 --> 03:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
existing that existing requirement um so
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
one I'm wondering where that requirement
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
exists in the law and two um
 
03:19:47.199 --> 03:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
exists in the law and two um
does

03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
this it's it's not clear that this
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
exempts from that other section of law
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
if if that other section of law exists
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
so not sure I can answer the other
 
03:20:02.229 --> 03:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
section of law question but just based
 
03:20:05.550 --> 03:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
on what the situation was in the town I
 
03:20:08.189 --> 03:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
represent um this was intended to fix
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
that so that the town would be able to
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
um on a temporary
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
basis help
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
a private road without a long-term
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
obligation representative
 
03:20:27.309 --> 03:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:20:30.750 --> 03:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
Senator so I'm familiar with some some
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh things in my town of molten beer
 
03:20:34.269 --> 03:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
which they're they're trying to do along
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
these same lines so I've spoken to my
 
03:20:39.070 --> 03:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
Selectmen about several of these issues
 
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years but to me it
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
seems like the the item that uh really
 
03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
controls this is the fact that this is a
 
03:20:51.389 --> 03:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
contract so there's a limited term to
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
this contract for use of the road and
 
03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
for maintenance of the road and also
 
03:20:58.910 --> 03:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
that the fact the fact is that when they
 
03:21:00.389 --> 03:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
enter into the contract it would
 
03:21:02.910 --> 03:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
determine who is going to maintain that
 
03:21:04.590 --> 03:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
road in for what time period am I
 
03:21:06.990 --> 03:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
correcting that assumption
 
03:21:10.189 --> 03:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I think you've probably done a pretty
 
03:21:13.070 --> 03:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
good job of explaining one potential
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
option that this would allow without
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
that long-term maintenance yes okay
 
03:21:19.990 --> 03:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you followup Mr chairman go ahead
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
so the follow-up question in regard to
 
03:21:25.790 --> 03:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
this is that uh also concer in that I
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand is it
 
03:21:28.349 --> 03:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
says that the commissioner of the
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation shall adopt
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
rules for two to the RSA governing this
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
Law's requirement so um have you worked
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Transportation
 
03:21:40.990 --> 03:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
and tried to understand what this is or
 
03:21:43.030 --> 03:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of guidance that or
 
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
did they testify in regard to this I
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't Rec that they testified in regard
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
to this in this okay thanks Senator
 
03:21:53.590 --> 03:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
yep representative
 
03:21:55.550 --> 03:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question uh if
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's change in ownership on the
 
03:22:03.189 --> 03:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
property is that left to the discretion
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
of or is that left to the discretion of
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
however the agreement was written or
 
03:22:09.630 --> 03:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
does that make the agreement null and
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
void in your
 
03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:12.469 align:start position:0%
void in your
opinion

03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
so on line four it's pretty explicit the
 
03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
municipality shall be responsible for
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
obtaining the written consent of every
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
owner of the road and so I would
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
interpret that to mean regardless of any
 
03:22:30.510 --> 03:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
change in ownership if there were any
 
03:22:32.110 --> 03:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:40.710 --> 03:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
issues representative Elward yes thank
 
03:22:44.110 --> 03:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Senator um I
 
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
have the same concern as to to where
 
03:22:50.910 --> 03:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
this contract would be you know
 
03:22:52.910 --> 03:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
archived I'm
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if it should be uh registered
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
with the registry of deeds should it be
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
an attachment this contract an
 
03:23:04.269 --> 03:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
attachment to the
 
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
um agreement written agreement I mean I
 
03:23:10.830 --> 03:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
I just and I also
 
03:23:10.840 --> 03:23:12.750 align:start position:0%
I just and I also
wonder

03:23:12.750 --> 03:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
03:23:17.550 --> 03:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
obligating um Private Road owners
 
03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:19.389 align:start position:0%
obligating um Private Road owners
[Music]

03:23:19.389 --> 03:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:23:22.910 --> 03:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
to something that we haven't um seen the
 
03:23:26.429 --> 03:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
rules you know from do what that would
 
03:23:30.910 --> 03:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
be about so can you expound on that at
 
03:23:30.920 --> 03:23:32.469 align:start position:0%
be about so can you expound on that at
all

03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
so in terms of registering it with the
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
um registry of deeds I'm not sure that's
 
03:23:43.389 --> 03:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
necessary but you know I'm open to that
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
discussion um and in terms of the the
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
second part of your
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
question as this was brought to me um it
 
03:23:58.349 --> 03:23:58.359 align:start position:0%
was meant to be temporary and
 
03:23:58.359 --> 03:24:01.630 align:start position:0%
was meant to be temporary and
so

03:24:01.630 --> 03:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
um again I think that
 
03:24:07.870 --> 03:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
the protection for the property owners
 
03:24:10.710 --> 03:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
is there and that they would have to
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
agree um with the
 
03:24:15.670 --> 03:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
municipality um doing whatever they
 
03:24:18.750 --> 03:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
would do on a short term
 
03:24:18.760 --> 03:24:20.790 align:start position:0%
would do on a short term
basis

03:24:20.790 --> 03:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.469 --> 03:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't read temporary in here whatso
 
03:24:31.710 --> 03:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
I I I understand that um
 
03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
but that's how it was explained to me
 
03:24:37.189 --> 03:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay I get it thank
 
03:24:39.269 --> 03:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair um my question
 
03:24:43.439 --> 03:24:44.790 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair um my question
would

03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:24:49.710 --> 03:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
be if a Town enters into an agreement
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
with a land Owners Association to do
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
work on a private road would the town
 
03:25:02.510 --> 03:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
then assume the liability for any damage
 
03:25:05.550 --> 03:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
that they did or would that
 
03:25:09.070 --> 03:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
maintain would that liability still lie
 
03:25:12.429 --> 03:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
with the road maintenance
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
Association thank you I'm not sure that
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
I could answer that I mean this is meant
 
03:25:18.550 --> 03:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
enabling um for towns to be able to
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
cooperate with private road owners if
 
03:25:26.349 --> 03:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
there's a situation where both
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
sides need to take action so long-term
 
03:25:32.550 --> 03:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
implications I'm not sure I can answer
 
03:25:34.269 --> 03:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
because we haven't seen
 
03:25:37.590 --> 03:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
stavis uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:25:41.590 --> 03:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I understand
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a lot of details
 
03:25:45.710 --> 03:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
about the bill but I have um some
 
03:25:45.720 --> 03:25:46.830 align:start position:0%
about the bill but I have um some
hypothetic

03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
hypothetic
 
03:25:49.189 --> 03:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
questions I would imagine that
 
03:25:52.110 --> 03:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners on private roads would flock
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
to this would it become law because
 
03:25:56.790 --> 03:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to have their Road
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
maintained and it cost tens of thousands
 
03:26:03.070 --> 03:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
of dollars to do so a and if if a New
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law exists that allows
 
03:26:06.710 --> 03:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities to enter into such
 
03:26:08.710 --> 03:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
agreements I would imagine that many
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners on private roads would want
 
03:26:10.880 --> 03:26:12.790 align:start position:0%
homeowners on private roads would want
such

03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
such
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
agreements where is the fairness in that
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
to those me homeowners on private roads
 
03:26:22.110 --> 03:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
who may not be able to convince their
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies to enter into such
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
agreements but maybe their neighbors on
 
03:26:29.790 --> 03:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
another private road have managed to
 
03:26:33.429 --> 03:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
convince their municipalities to do so
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that there are two
 
03:26:37.630 --> 03:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
categories of roads in New Hampshire
 
03:26:39.870 --> 03:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
those maintained by the municipality and
 
03:26:42.389 --> 03:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
those that aren't
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
so again I think this is meant to be
 
03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
enabling for those circumstances where
 
03:26:55.189 --> 03:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
there is agreement
 
03:26:58.070 --> 03:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
between um a municipality because it
 
03:27:02.110 --> 03:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
says may doesn't say shall it says may
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
and an agreement has to um be signed by
 
03:27:12.389 --> 03:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
every road every owner um on the road
 
03:27:15.309 --> 03:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
so Private Road owners go before Town
 
03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
meetings all the time trying to get the
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
town to take over the long-term
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
obligations on that road and make it a
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
town own Road I mean that happens
 
03:27:29.309 --> 03:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
virtually at every town meeting and the
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the legislative body is has to
 
03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
make a decision whether it should or
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen this is as I understand
 
03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
it would allow some maybe more
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
short-term option um that wouldn't
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
obligate a
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
long-term um situ
 
03:27:49.030 --> 03:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
ation to
 
03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:50.630 align:start position:0%
ation to
repair

03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
repair
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
use a road that
 
03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
needed that kind of assistance and
 
03:27:59.070 --> 03:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
property owners that it would benefit
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
both sides the town and the property
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
owners that
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
um as I understand it doesn't exist in
 
03:28:10.189 --> 03:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
law today so um you know you're asking a
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
lot of questions I'm sorry I don't have
 
03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
every answer for that it it is a
 
03:28:16.349 --> 03:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
constituent request because it was was a
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
real situation that occurred in
 
03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
Wakefield and my constituent Mr Robbins
 
03:28:24.189 --> 03:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
can probably walk you through exactly
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
what happened and why you know in the
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
situation in the town of Wakefield he
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:37.790 --> 03:28:37.800 align:start position:0%

uh explain who you are I'm assuming
 
03:29:31.630 --> 03:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of this and then give us
 
03:29:34.349 --> 03:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
your testim the right button press it
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
down and just release it there you go
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
pull it close to you so we can hear you
 
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
almost like I know what I'm doing pull
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
pull the mic closer to you because we're
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to hear you push
 
03:29:46.990 --> 03:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
this closer
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
you're the first person who said they
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't hand me in my life but go ahead
 
03:29:55.710 --> 03:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
okay yes um I brought this to Senator
 
03:29:57.550 --> 03:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
Bradley about a year and a half ago and
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
obviously last year's legislature you
 
03:30:02.429 --> 03:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
fill hold on one sec let us know who you
 
03:30:03.950 --> 03:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
are your name excuse me where you're
 
03:30:06.309 --> 03:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
from and I whether you're for or against
 
03:30:09.189 --> 03:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
the bill okay it's uh Chuck or Charles
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
Robbins from Wakefield New
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I'm Father Bill I'm the
 
03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
Catalyst behind this being here today
 
03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
and I spoke in front of the Senate back
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
on uh February 6 committee and they were
 
03:30:27.389 --> 03:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
helpful and Senator gray was great he
 
03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
was the one who put
 
03:30:32.550 --> 03:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
the um amendment in to add legislative
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
bodies the first language so that us the
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
town people would vote on it and put it
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
into our um zoning ordinance and the
 
03:30:45.229 --> 03:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
purpose of it is for years since 1984 i'
 
03:30:47.469 --> 03:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
like all of you we've uh swam in the New
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lake since we were born but
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
since 1984 I've sent out letters in my
 
03:30:56.349 --> 03:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
town to uh for the different lakes and
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
I've watched uh what's going on with the
 
03:31:01.590 --> 03:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
Lakes back in the 80s we were concerned
 
03:31:05.189 --> 03:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
mainly with sewage and uh that was a big
 
03:31:07.950 --> 03:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
point and there was 13 points that the
 
03:31:11.710 --> 03:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
dees sent out uh don't feed the Ducks
 
03:31:13.189 --> 03:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
because they'll have more than one
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
litter so there were many points don't
 
03:31:16.510 --> 03:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
use colored toilet paper paper things
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
like that I got phone calls over that
 
03:31:21.790 --> 03:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
one but uh over the years the bigger
 
03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
problem obviously when we all were kids
 
03:31:28.309 --> 03:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
we all went swimming in these lakes and
 
03:31:30.349 --> 03:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
we probably used soap because no one had
 
03:31:32.830 --> 03:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
showers nobody had washing machines no
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
one was if you had a 55 gallon drum that
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
might have been your septic system so
 
03:31:40.710 --> 03:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
people use them as camps so the impact
 
03:31:42.910 --> 03:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
over the years has been that people are
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
spending a lot more time there as we all
 
03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
know getting a lot of knockdowns in new
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
homes with new septic systems but still
 
03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
the impact but the big thing that I've
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
learned over the years is um and my
 
03:31:58.750 --> 03:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
background is Development I've done gas
 
03:32:01.349 --> 03:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
stations Billboards housing subdivisions
 
03:32:03.550 --> 03:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
so I have some excavation knowledge for
 
03:32:06.990 --> 03:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
dirt work but over the years I wasn't
 
03:32:09.870 --> 03:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
really that sharp until probably 7 eight
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
10 years ago that all this gravel that
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're bringing into these private roads
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
every year and sometimes roads but
 
03:32:20.670 --> 03:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
mostly private we have 50 miles of Roads
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
around uh shorefront in Wakefield so
 
03:32:27.110 --> 03:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
every year we bring gravel in and I was
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
made aware it's filled with nutrients so
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
these nutrients as it disappears it ends
 
03:32:35.150 --> 03:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
up in the Lakes what it's doing is we
 
03:32:37.189 --> 03:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
you've all heard about Caceria and
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
that's everywhere now and the biggest
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
thing that we're missing is one of these
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
results is dissolved oxygen the bre
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
breathable air in these Lakes for The
 
03:32:52.030 --> 03:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
Aquatic Life is disappearing I'll give
 
03:32:54.429 --> 03:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
you two examples of our 678 lakes in
 
03:32:56.670 --> 03:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
Wakefield could you hold on just one
 
03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
second no up front up here
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairman right could you try to speak to
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
the subject matter of the bill the bill
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
is whether or not a town is going to
 
03:33:10.630 --> 03:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
maintain a private road or not great all
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
the the the other stuff you're talking
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
about really doesn't apply we need to
 
03:33:17.269 --> 03:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
hear why great so the reason so that
 
03:33:18.830 --> 03:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's a good place for me to stop then
 
03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
so all this gravel that I'm talking
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
about we have to find an alternative we
 
03:33:25.550 --> 03:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
have to control that erosion that's
 
03:33:29.429 --> 03:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
going into the Lakes now the rules that
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has ruled down if you
 
03:33:34.189 --> 03:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
even go in and plow these private roads
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
you may be held
 
03:33:38.349 --> 03:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
responsible so when I proposed this to
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
the town a couple years ago that was one
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
of the concerns of one of my Selectmen
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
we've had cits blow out on these roads
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
and because the covits blew out we've
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
had to go in and deal with it well the
 
03:33:51.910 --> 03:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
town's been very afraid to deal with
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
even replacing a covet that's stopping
 
03:33:56.189 --> 03:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
people from getting to their homes
 
03:33:57.070 --> 03:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to take
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
ownership of the
 
03:34:02.229 --> 03:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
road so that's what this is coming from
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
is the fact that these roads have to be
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
maintained but the towns don't want them
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
someday if all the people who live in
 
03:34:12.990 --> 03:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
town vote to take a road over that'll be
 
03:34:15.150 --> 03:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
different but until then most towns
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to own these private roads
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
and this is I'm specifically talking
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
about Lakes you people may have heard
 
03:34:21.790 --> 03:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
about other towns that have private
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
roads not near lakes and that's a big
 
03:34:26.590 --> 03:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
issue too I'm sure but in order for the
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
town to go in and work on these Lakes
 
03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
not have to take the responsibility of
 
03:34:34.110 --> 03:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
them I'm a real estate guy you can make
 
03:34:36.790 --> 03:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
a deal you can write out the specifics
 
03:34:39.070 --> 03:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
in that contract for the year
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
2024 we're going to go into Lake Road
 
03:34:44.830 --> 03:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
and we're going to work from this point
 
03:34:46.830 --> 03:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
to this point
 
03:34:49.150 --> 03:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
and we're going to perform these duties
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
and both parties agree the landowner who
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
would be the road owner if there's
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
multiple you'll have to get everybody to
 
03:34:59.110 --> 03:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
sign off on it and the
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
municipality spelled out in here would
 
03:35:04.229 --> 03:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
be no responsibility to the municipality
 
03:35:05.950 --> 03:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
beyond what they're saying they're going
 
03:35:08.550 --> 03:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
to go in and then wake field just as an
 
03:35:10.189 --> 03:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
example why this is so important and
 
03:35:11.550 --> 03:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
it's a reflection to the rest of the
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
state we are
 
03:35:16.510 --> 03:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
70.8% almost 71%
 
03:35:20.110 --> 03:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
of our total revenue comes off of these
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes we we spend very little to protect
 
03:35:25.950 --> 03:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
them and and 2016 I fought to get a
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
shorel officer in one of the first if
 
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
not the first in the state because the
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
dees is way overstretched they have one
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
guy taking care of multiple Lakes it's
 
03:35:41.189 --> 03:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
just and we don't have any enforcement
 
03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
so if there's any questions I'm sure
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
I've talked more than I should have but
 
03:35:45.680 --> 03:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
I've talked more than I should have but
go

03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:35:49.630 --> 03:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
ahead representative we'll start over
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
there representative priest go ahead
 
03:35:54.110 --> 03:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and thank you
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
for being here um if the town goes in
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
and makes the
 
03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
necessary uh
 
03:36:04.630 --> 03:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
improvements uh for your private road
 
03:36:07.229 --> 03:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
will they then come back to you and
 
03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
assess you for the work that they have
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
done assess who assess who assess the
 
03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
property owners that are getting the
 
03:36:19.469 --> 03:36:19.479 align:start position:0%
benefits from the road uh improvements I
 
03:36:21.150 --> 03:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
think that's a reflection of the sale
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
price and in Wakefield we do every five
 
03:36:26.469 --> 03:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
years sometimes do every year but if if
 
03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
that if anything done is done to a
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
property if you have a better view or
 
03:36:33.030 --> 03:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
anything you'll be assessed for what the
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
assessor perceives as an improvement I
 
03:36:36.120 --> 03:36:38.349 align:start position:0%
assessor perceives as an improvement I
would

03:36:38.349 --> 03:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:36:41.070 --> 03:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
assume representative y
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
Kell thank you thank you for uh your
 
03:36:44.760 --> 03:36:46.269 align:start position:0%
Kell thank you thank you for uh your
testimony

03:36:46.269 --> 03:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
um since since uh you referenced this uh
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision are you famili
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
can you um tell me what the the Supreme
 
03:37:00.750 --> 03:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
Court decision uh the name of it was and
 
03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
or the the law that they were basing
 
03:37:06.189 --> 03:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:37:08.910 --> 03:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh I left that package on the car I've
 
03:37:11.309 --> 03:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
had it for years in my pocket I wish I
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
could give you the
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
number I mean you could follow up
 
03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme well I could follow up with you
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
yeah but the Supreme Court has
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
constantly ruled that town should stay
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
away from any type of financial or
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
physical involvement in working on
 
03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
private roads with as little as and that
 
03:37:33.510 --> 03:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
that one big case was about snow plowing
 
03:37:35.110 --> 03:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
which we would think would be pretty
 
03:37:37.189 --> 03:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
innocuous but just because they were
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
snow plowing that road the state said uh
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court ruled you're working
 
03:37:43.870 --> 03:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
on that road you're accepting
 
03:37:45.790 --> 03:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility so that's what we're
 
03:37:47.349 --> 03:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
avoid representative
 
03:37:54.189 --> 03:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
Elwood all right so thank you Mr
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um yes statute does say I think
 
03:38:02.429 --> 03:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
uh if you plow if the town maintains or
 
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
repairs a private road
 
03:38:08.550 --> 03:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
within I think it's five years if they
 
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
do it continually for five years that
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
they're then obligated uh to continue
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining the road
 
03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:18.630 align:start position:0%
maintaining the road
how

03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
would the town be
 
03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
compensated for doing plowing repair or
 
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the road well I I think
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
that the point is in Wakefield we have
 
03:38:33.389 --> 03:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
a$2 million budget and as I said 14
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
million of it's coming from there 90% or
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
better of the people paying those tax
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
bills do not live there year round so we
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't have school children from them we
 
03:38:45.150 --> 03:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
don't have public services dump police
 
03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
fire higher at the same rate as a
 
03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
citizen so for us we have a 685 tax rate
 
03:38:52.630 --> 03:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
we're the cheapest town in the state of
 
03:38:54.309 --> 03:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for any town with more
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
than 4,000
 
03:38:59.150 --> 03:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
population 5,000 excuse me 5,000 molor
 
03:39:01.389 --> 03:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
has 4,300 and they're cheaper but
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
Wakefield is it's unbelievable to live
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
there I live on the Milton Mills Town
 
03:39:09.630 --> 03:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
Line my house is
 
03:39:12.750 --> 03:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
4,200 the same house over the line would
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
probably be 11 or 12 Grand and that's
 
03:39:17.309 --> 03:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
reflect of Rochester DOA probably the
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
towns over here um so the benefit to
 
03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
these lakes and the overall benefit to
 
03:39:24.910 --> 03:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire people are
 
03:39:27.750 --> 03:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
coming here for clean Lakes not cob
 
03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:29.070 align:start position:0%
coming here for clean Lakes not cob
bacteria

03:39:29.070 --> 03:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
bacteria
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
Laden go ahead sorry man go
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
ahead representative
 
03:39:36.750 --> 03:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
03:39:38.710 --> 03:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I am the rep
 
03:39:40.790 --> 03:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives from molor so
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
I know what you're talking about so
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
anyway um I guess one of the things I
 
03:39:46.990 --> 03:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'd want to ask you about is you know
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
this is a temporary contract but also
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
have you reviewed this with your
 
03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
selectman and is this something that
 
03:39:55.870 --> 03:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
they've said they want to do well what
 
03:39:58.710 --> 03:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
happened was because I'm always in there
 
03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
pushing the legs I I did a survey in
 
03:40:05.469 --> 03:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
20121 on this specifically on working on
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
private roads and putting a crew
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
together and I got a five to one
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
response and you had to give me your
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
name address and what you thought it
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't Anonymous so when you get a 5:1
 
03:40:18.030 --> 03:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
response I brought that into selectman I
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
brought that survey in and showed them
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
that ta taxpayers are willing but the
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:40:26.830 --> 03:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
selectman you know smartly brought this
 
03:40:29.309 --> 03:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
point up I said I'm a real estate guy I
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
can you can make a contract with anyone
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
you don't need the state law was my
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
belief you should be able they still
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
would be more comfortable if the state
 
03:40:39.510 --> 03:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
would back them up and say we make a
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
contract with someone that's usually
 
03:40:43.389 --> 03:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
legally binding at least the state's not
 
03:40:44.670 --> 03:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
going to and the Supreme Court's not
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
going to tell us
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
do we have to take the road over
 
03:40:49.870 --> 03:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
followup Mr
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so the the question I have then
 
03:40:56.229 --> 03:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
in regard to this is what would prevent
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
the town or the property owners uh in
 
03:41:01.309 --> 03:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
Wakefield from saying okay you fixed my
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
road this year you took care of the
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
covits this year I'm real happy then six
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
years later five years later they want
 
03:41:09.910 --> 03:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
to do another contract to maintain their
 
03:41:09.920 --> 03:41:10.910 align:start position:0%
to do another contract to maintain their
Road

03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
Road
 
03:41:13.469 --> 03:41:13.479 align:start position:0%
basically I think both like any contract
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
and any deal that you're do in life both
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
parties have to be willing to sign on to
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
you representative kill thank you Mr
 
03:41:24.910 --> 03:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
chair I'm over here sir thank you for
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is your town
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
currently maintaining your road plowing
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
anything like that no none of our we
 
03:41:34.990 --> 03:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
stay away from it as I say we have 50
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
miles of shorefront so we have almost
 
03:41:39.229 --> 03:41:39.239 align:start position:0%
matching amount of roads and most of all
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
of them are private so the town has been
 
03:41:44.229 --> 03:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
very aware that you don't go near those
 
03:41:47.229 --> 03:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
roads follow up go ahead I I was
 
03:41:49.389 --> 03:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
referring to your your individual your
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
road are you on a private road sir I
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
have my home where I live I'm on a
 
03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
regular Town Road I just four years ago
 
03:42:01.349 --> 03:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
bought on a Camp Road and I had landed
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
on a Camp Road for years before that but
 
03:42:03.720 --> 03:42:05.189 align:start position:0%
on a Camp Road for years before that but
I've

03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
I've
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
never I'm on a Camp Road where the
 
03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
people really take care of the road they
 
03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
do a Monster job they do as well as any
 
03:42:15.910 --> 03:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
municipality could but they bring in
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
gravel they grade it the gravel goes in
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
the lake and therefore New Hampshire's
 
03:42:22.630 --> 03:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
losing this valuable tax
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
revenue further questions representative
 
03:42:29.149 --> 03:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
majori thank you Mr chairman um this
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
question may be getting too far into the
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
weeds I'm not really sure but if the
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
private road has been recognized by the
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
planning board then the municipality can
 
03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
make it the governing body can make a
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
decision about whether or not they're
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to accept that as a dedicated Road
 
03:42:47.149 --> 03:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:42:49.790 --> 03:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
instance what I'm concerned about is if
 
03:42:53.189 --> 03:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
the road has not been recognized by the
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
planning board in order for this road to
 
03:42:58.110 --> 03:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
be recognized by the municipality it
 
03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
needs legislative body approval a
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
warrant article so I'm I'm wondering if
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have gotten so if I'm getting so far
 
03:43:08.189 --> 03:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
into the weeds where you have
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
contemplated whether or not that
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
contract would have to go before the
 
03:43:14.149 --> 03:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
legislative body as a warrant article
 
03:43:16.110 --> 03:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
for approval
 
03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
well I think I think that what Senator
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
gray added in his addendum the first uh
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
line legislative bodies of the
 
03:43:26.830 --> 03:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
municipality may enter into agreements I
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
think that that was a sharp thing that
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
he gave me on the senate committee
 
03:43:35.710 --> 03:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
meeting but uh you know private roads
 
03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
are a big thing but for a town like
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
Wakefield when you're talking almost 71%
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
of its income you bet I mean if if a
 
03:43:45.389 --> 03:43:45.399 align:start position:0%
company comes to your town or your state
 
03:43:47.309 --> 03:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
and says I'm going to employ a th000 or
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
a 100,000 for the state most communities
 
03:43:52.630 --> 03:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
they give them five years of free taxes
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
they bend over backwards when you bring
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
that type of Revenue in that's what
 
03:43:58.590 --> 03:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
these Lakes are they're a huge Revenue
 
03:44:06.830 --> 03:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
sir all right further question represent
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question here oh hi
 
03:44:18.870 --> 03:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
um when I first read this and I saw the
 
03:44:18.880 --> 03:44:19.790 align:start position:0%
um when I first read this and I saw the
word

03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:44:24.269 --> 03:44:24.279 align:start position:0%
use um my impression and that it's just
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
what came to my mind was Municipal
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
trucks or or Vehicles passing through on
 
03:44:35.070 --> 03:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
a privately owned Road not anything
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
about constructing a road or maintaining
 
03:44:41.070 --> 03:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
a road just using it like you use any
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
street is that um
 
03:44:48.990 --> 03:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
is use maybe the wrong word well I think
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
that the the key here is no work is
 
03:44:54.910 --> 03:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
going to be done until there's a written
 
03:44:57.830 --> 03:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
contract between the owner of the
 
03:45:02.309 --> 03:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
road and the municipality so like you
 
03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
said we can go in and look at different
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
parts here but this is just giving the
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
town the the ability to enter into a
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
contract with a landowner which they
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
could do now but my Selectmen who
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
brought it up wanted the backing of the
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
state to say just because we're in there
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
working on the road and we have a valid
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
contract with the road owner we do not
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
have to accept this as the Supreme Court
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
has ruled even with plowing and as
 
03:45:31.229 --> 03:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
representative over there mentioned
 
03:45:33.630 --> 03:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
earlier the repetitive helping of people
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
on the road may end up having you own
 
03:45:37.950 --> 03:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
the road specifically you would not be
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
entering into anything like that with a
 
03:45:39.840 --> 03:45:43.110 align:start position:0%
entering into anything like that with a
written

03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%

day

03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%

good uh we'll go ahead and open up the
 
03:48:31.149 --> 03:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:35.229 --> 03:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
bill Senate Bill 383 relative to local
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
tax caps and Senator Murphy is prime
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor you are up thank you Mr chairman
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's a pleasure
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
to be back in front of my friends in the
 
03:48:45.870 --> 03:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
house um
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
this bill Keith Murphy representing the
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
towns of Raymond Candia hookit Goffstown
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and Manchester's First Ward this bill is
 
03:48:56.590 --> 03:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation allowing uh another
 
03:48:58.830 --> 03:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
method of calculating a tax cap for
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
communities that choose to adopt it um
 
03:49:02.990 --> 03:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
it does add another method for school
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
districts to impl a tax cap it
 
03:49:04.880 --> 03:49:05.870 align:start position:0%
districts to impl a tax cap it
essentially

03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:49:09.149 --> 03:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
allows the same methods for towns that
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
are currently allowed for cities
 
03:49:14.110 --> 03:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
um uh and the committee amendment that
 
03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
we adopted over over in the Senate uh
 
03:49:17.710 --> 03:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
address some issues that were brought to
 
03:49:19.389 --> 03:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
our attention during the hearing by the
 
03:49:22.189 --> 03:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
municipal Association um I have with me
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
in the interest of efficiency Mr
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
chairman representative uh McGuire he is
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor and I think is very uh
 
03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak on the bill as
 
03:49:34.590 --> 03:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you so um yeah representative
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
Dan Maguire I represent the town of epom
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
so when we what this bill does is it
 
03:49:45.389 --> 03:49:45.399 align:start position:0%
modifies RSA uh 32 colon 5
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
which is an existing um form of tax cap
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh in our law for towns but it's but
 
03:49:57.990 --> 03:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's um not used very much because it's
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
really poorly written so this is a bill
 
03:50:05.389 --> 03:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
to make it more practical um as you as
 
03:50:08.149 --> 03:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware many cities like
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester nsha
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
Franklin have tax caps of of various
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
sorts as part of their
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
um Charters and
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
um RSA 32 colon 5 allows towns um to
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
have similar sort of tax caps the
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
problem is the way it's written those
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
are those tax caps don't really work
 
03:50:35.070 --> 03:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
very well because because the language
 
03:50:38.349 --> 03:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
in in 32 colon 5 says you can have one
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
of two kinds of tax caps you can have it
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
such that the amount for next year is a
 
03:50:47.349 --> 03:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
fixed dollar amount more than this year
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
right so if your budget is a million
 
03:50:53.070 --> 03:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
this year and your tax cap says $50,000
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
then next year you you your budget could
 
03:50:59.710 --> 03:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
be a million 50,000 right or the RSA
 
03:51:02.149 --> 03:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
allows you to have a fixed percentage
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
right like your your budget can go up by
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
2% per year something like that the
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
problem is you know reality is not fixed
 
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
numbers or fixed percentages right
 
03:51:16.269 --> 03:51:16.279 align:start position:0%
reality with inflation is well this year
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
it's very high next year it's not so
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
high and so on plus the fact that
 
03:51:24.670 --> 03:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
districts or you know the the population
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
of those districts changes per year also
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
right so some towns um are growing their
 
03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
population very rapidly presumably they
 
03:51:36.469 --> 03:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know their services would have to
 
03:51:39.070 --> 03:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
change more quickly than other places
 
03:51:41.389 --> 03:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
where the population isn't changing very
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
rapidly and so what this bill does does
 
03:51:48.429 --> 03:51:48.439 align:start position:0%
is it allows towns to have a tax
 
03:51:52.269 --> 03:51:52.279 align:start position:0%
cap similar to what cities now do which
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
is the cap can move year toe based on
 
03:52:00.189 --> 03:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
population change times an inflation
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
Factor okay so that's a practical tax
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
cap not like the ones the ones in here
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
and the the bill um allows these caps to
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
to be placed by school districts and or
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
by towns right so on the town part of
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
the budget or on the the school district
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
part and um there's details but but
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
basically the um the adoption of such a
 
03:52:31.870 --> 03:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
cap and or the deletion of such a cap
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
would be done by a 60% vote three fifths
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
or overriding such a cap would be a
 
03:52:41.229 --> 03:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
35ths vote so so you need a super
 
03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
majority to put it in place you need a
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
super majority to take it away
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
super majority change it but once it's
 
03:52:50.830 --> 03:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
in place um towns or school districts
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
would have to follow these caps and um
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative power asked me to mention
 
03:52:59.910 --> 03:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have um she and I have a small
 
03:53:02.830 --> 03:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that um has to do with the
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
timing of uh School District budgeting
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
right so the the way the school district
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
budgeting you know what happens this
 
03:53:12.510 --> 03:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
year and next year and so on um in the
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't quite match what
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
they actually do and so this this
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
amendment fixes that I think and we're
 
03:53:22.990 --> 03:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
03:53:26.910 --> 03:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you for uh bringing this
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
and this has been needed quite a while
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know fixed
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
amounts and percentages when inflation
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
goes like this I mean we've seen the
 
03:53:47.469 --> 03:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
impact of that in the recent times with
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
all the impacts of inflation and so
 
03:53:55.309 --> 03:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
forth my question is some towns don't
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
have tax caps they have spending
 
03:54:04.429 --> 03:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
caps now does this bill impact spending
 
03:54:08.110 --> 03:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
caps in the same way that you talk about
 
03:54:08.120 --> 03:54:09.630 align:start position:0%
caps in the same way that you talk about
tax

03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
gaps I can answer yeah so it's it's sort
 
03:54:15.870 --> 03:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
of a technical thing but but the way
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
this is written is that on towns it's a
 
03:54:22.269 --> 03:54:22.279 align:start position:0%
tax cap so it's the it's the actual tax
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
amount for the municipality on school
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
districts it's a spending cap it's a
 
03:54:30.030 --> 03:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's the amount they're spending because
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
because they have Revenue so towns
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
almost have much more sort of known
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue right whereas school districts
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
some years they get a grant some years
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
they don't and all that sort of things
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
so so on school districts it's a
 
03:54:49.389 --> 03:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.070 --> 03:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
G representative yella go ahead thank
 
03:54:57.269 --> 03:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking the question
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
um you said
 
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
that there is or at least you indicated
 
03:55:08.349 --> 03:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
that there was very few but you didn't
 
03:55:10.990 --> 03:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
specifically say that no municipality
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
currently has this um setup and so my
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
question to you is if municipalities
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
already have this set up um would you be
 
03:55:28.670 --> 03:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
essentially barring them from the their
 
03:55:33.389 --> 03:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
how they have it currently and if this
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
changes kind of like we when we change
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
you know um uh the law regarding
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
exemptions they have to reopt it um
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
which may or may not be um easy I'm
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
wondering about the people that are
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
currently under a c tax cap will they
 
03:55:53.790 --> 03:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
have to reopt and will they have to
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
adopt this new structure or are they
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
able to be grandfathered in if they like
 
03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
their structure can they keep it uh yes
 
03:56:02.269 --> 03:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:56:04.349 --> 03:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative and the answer is yes
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
this does not affect existing um there
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
there's a handful the I I I think
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
there's three maybe or four I have the
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
list somewhere yeah 10 yeah whatever
 
03:56:18.349 --> 03:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
there's a small number but um the
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
biggest one is dairy in fact um and um
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
but if you look on page
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
two um line
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
one so the tax so we're just adding the
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
word multipli multiplication Factor so
 
03:56:38.349 --> 03:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
you so the tax cap can be a fixed amount
 
03:56:41.630 --> 03:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
a fixed percentage or a multiplication
 
03:56:44.389 --> 03:56:44.399 align:start position:0%
Factor right so this is a new thing that
 
03:56:47.189 --> 03:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
they can adopt if they want to but
 
03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
presumably the way they would change if
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
they already had a fixed dollar amount
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
and wanted a multiplication Factor they
 
03:56:55.550 --> 03:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
would have a two a three- fif vote to
 
03:56:58.149 --> 03:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
you know make a change like that
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
yeah represent power thank you Mr
 
03:57:02.790 --> 03:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
chairman I have two points of
 
03:57:05.229 --> 03:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
clarification so the first would be that
 
03:57:07.990 --> 03:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
this I see three sections in this bill
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
the first um section is pertains to a
 
03:57:14.429 --> 03:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
local tax cap and I I just just would
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
like to clarify um that it does pertain
 
03:57:19.870 --> 03:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
to both towns as well as school
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
districts and I know that to be true
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
because my um Brookline School District
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
has a local tax
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
cap and um with regards to section two
 
03:57:33.670 --> 03:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's a school district Bud well the
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
first one's a tax effort cap with
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
regards to section two the School
 
03:57:39.990 --> 03:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
District budget cap is is a spending cap
 
03:57:42.790 --> 03:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that that would be new legislation
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't already exist and the third
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
point of clarification is that um the
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill when drafted was wisely put in
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
section three which pertains to
 
03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
applicability and it says that with
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
regards to the local tax caps previously
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
in place it does not require local reopt
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it would not pertain to section two
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
of School District budget caps because
 
03:58:12.389 --> 03:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
statute we agree
 
03:58:18.389 --> 03:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
do you have a response to that question
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
I'm kidding I think that's all correct
 
03:58:22.750 --> 03:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't any question we agree further
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative lales your
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
mic's still on you have a question
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
nope uh representative major thank you
 
03:58:32.429 --> 03:58:32.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious about the
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
calculator if if that is a a new
 
03:58:40.149 --> 03:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
calculator that that you created or if
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
it has if it has some proven effects
 
03:58:45.389 --> 03:58:45.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere just just curious about the
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.790 --> 03:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
calculator are you asking about um in
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
1ba just 1ba yeah so I I I I'm sort of
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
looking at um or page two line 19 for oh
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah I should uh so page I guess
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
that would be sorry page two lines lines
 
03:59:12.950 --> 03:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
13 through 17 so the way you come up
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
with that calculation is that based on
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
some best practice or is that is that
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
and and please forgive the word a new
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
invention I don't mean invention in a
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
derogatory way no I think this is very
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
similar to what cities do okay okay and
 
03:59:30.910 --> 03:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
there are some details here like for
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
example on line 20 where we had the
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
municipal cost index so that this
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
language is fairly flexible it allows a
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
a a school district or or a municipality
 
03:59:47.030 --> 03:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
to choose the inflation index that they
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
want it doesn't have to be CPI it could
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
be this one also listed here Municipal
 
03:59:55.750 --> 03:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
cost index that's one the municipal
 
03:59:58.830 --> 03:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
Association asked us to add because
 
04:00:00.349 --> 04:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
because there are a few different
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
inflation indices and uh some may be
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to Municipal expenses
 
04:00:10.110 --> 04:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
and and costs and others to you know
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
different kinds of costs so so the P the
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
organiz that makes the Warren article to
 
04:00:18.910 --> 04:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
adopt it would would make a decision we
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
want the such and such you know the CPI
 
04:00:24.830 --> 04:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
or the MCI or whichever index they
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
want yeah representative stavis uh thank
 
04:00:31.389 --> 04:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
question which I will desperately try to
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
articulate in a way that makes sense I'm
 
04:00:42.429 --> 04:00:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
one line
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
well the section section
 
04:00:47.120 --> 04:00:49.110 align:start position:0%
well the section section
four

04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
um under subsection
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
1B which pertains to population figures
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
and it's lines 28 29 and 30 population
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
shall mean the population figures
 
04:01:04.349 --> 04:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
calculated by the Department of Business
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs office of Planning
 
04:01:10.429 --> 04:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
and Development pursuant RSA 78 a25
 
04:01:15.550 --> 04:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 and as I read 78 a25
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 I see some potential
 
04:01:21.670 --> 04:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
pitfalls that I have questions about and
 
04:01:24.030 --> 04:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
they have to do with the dates by which
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
this information is
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
gathered uh and the um opportunities for
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities to appeal the numbers
 
04:01:37.389 --> 04:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
they get from planning if they disagree
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
with those numbers now in the middle of
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
all of this estimating and repor repor
 
04:01:47.189 --> 04:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
in on the preceding Year's population
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
which is what planning reports
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
on how does that mesh with the need to
 
04:01:56.830 --> 04:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
set up an an annual
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
budget in a municipality is there is
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
there are there potential timing
 
04:02:05.550 --> 04:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
problems there that that need to be
 
04:02:07.870 --> 04:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
addressed right thank you for the
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
question representative I I guess I
 
04:02:13.630 --> 04:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
would say that you have to pick a date
 
04:02:16.590 --> 04:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
right and and
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be you know this this
 
04:02:20.910 --> 04:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be a date that that works
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
annually right so so if you're off by
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
one year in some sense it's I I don't
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
see that as a as a huge tragedy um but
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
we asked the drafters to just give us
 
04:02:38.429 --> 04:02:38.439 align:start position:0%
where is in law the existing sort of
 
04:02:41.550 --> 04:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
standard place where um where
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
populations are are referenced right and
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
that's this spot so
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
um I guess I don't have a a better
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
answer for you
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
but I would just also if I may chime in
 
04:02:58.910 --> 04:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
that um page two line B you know it
 
04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
revers that multiplication factor and
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
towns can adjust for that with the
 
04:03:01.760 --> 04:03:03.229 align:start position:0%
towns can adjust for that with the
multiplication

04:03:03.229 --> 04:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
multiplication
 
04:03:05.830 --> 04:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
factor a town growing or shrinking if
 
04:03:07.149 --> 04:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
you really believe that one year is
 
04:03:08.670 --> 04:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
making a huge difference they can adjust
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
for that the multiplication Factor I'm
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't hear that last part if a
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
town is shrinking at 1% a year or 2% a
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
year or 3% a year shrinking or growing
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
they can adjust the multiplication
 
04:03:22.269 --> 04:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
Factor when they adopt the tax cap they
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
can take that into account at the
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
comments I have two very easy ones
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.590 --> 04:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
your formula you have the inflation one
 
04:03:44.590 --> 04:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
plus the inflation
 
04:03:47.309 --> 04:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
Factor Why is the one there what's the
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah so so let's say the cap is a
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars and inflation is
 
04:04:02.149 --> 04:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
2% right you want
 
04:04:05.389 --> 04:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
1.02 times the million dollars is your
 
04:04:07.870 --> 04:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
new limit right your new limit is a
 
04:04:07.880 --> 04:04:08.910 align:start position:0%
new limit right your new limit is a
million

04:04:08.910 --> 04:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:04:11.950 --> 04:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
$20,000 right if you see what I mean so
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
the one is is the existing plus the
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
difference right and the inflation is
 
04:04:17.680 --> 04:04:18.790 align:start position:0%
difference right and the inflation is
the

04:04:18.790 --> 04:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:21.309 --> 04:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
difference I think I was misreading it I
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
thought I thought what you were getting
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
at it is it could be inflation FL Factor
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
plus an additional 1% you're no no no I
 
04:04:31.630 --> 04:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
got you never mind all right uh second
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
question uh on line 19 page two you kind
 
04:04:38.429 --> 04:04:38.439 align:start position:0%
of touched on it uh you can use one of
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
two inflation
 
04:04:44.910 --> 04:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
indexes um it's actually more than two
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
so the first thing where it says hold on
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
hold on hold on hold on I'm sorry
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
um but what got me is the word either
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
why uh and I know you mentioned the nhma
 
04:04:58.030 --> 04:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
suggested one of the
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
two uh but why either why why are you
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
getting away from consistency in that
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
regard this thank you for the question
 
04:05:13.309 --> 04:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
but this is this is flexibility for for
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
town to make a choice right so so I
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the US Bureau of Labor
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
Statistics has multiple inflation indes
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
sees right they have CPI Dash something
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
rather urban and rural and different
 
04:05:34.830 --> 04:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
things right so so the people that adopt
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
this can can choose one of those or this
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
other one the municipal cost index Etc
 
04:05:41.279 --> 04:05:42.110 align:start position:0%
other one the municipal cost index Etc
right

04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
so they're all relatively similar but
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
but as I understand it the municipal
 
04:05:49.389 --> 04:05:49.399 align:start position:0%
cost index
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
includes the CPI is more or less
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
um uh an index based on uh salaries and
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
and labor and that kind of thing
 
04:06:04.590 --> 04:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
mostly um and that's you know that's
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable because most government
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
expenses are for salaries but but the
 
04:06:12.670 --> 04:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
municipal cost index includes some
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
construction factors right so so it it
 
04:06:19.630 --> 04:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
it um you know if you need to build
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
every once in a while you build a new
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
school or a new building you know that's
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
and and roads are obviously construction
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
so so you know they may argue that
 
04:06:30.149 --> 04:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's a better
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
index they're they're not that different
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
right so basically I guess my basic
 
04:06:37.469 --> 04:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
question is why the choice but you're
 
04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
agnostic to what which one they pick
 
04:06:42.149 --> 04:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely good it's it's the
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
people doing it are going to have to
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
make their own Arguments for it right
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
and so let them pick what they want very
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
good represent power thank you Mr
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
question on page three SE Roman numeral
 
04:06:58.830 --> 04:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
section 4 is it true that um these fine
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
details will be specified in the the
 
04:07:03.429 --> 04:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
question that will appear on the warrant
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
as to um what the School District budget
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
cap is going to look like um regarding
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
like the picking and choosing of what
 
04:07:15.309 --> 04:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
the formula is going to be it will be
 
04:07:18.070 --> 04:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
all specified and laid out right there
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
um in the Warren
 
04:07:20.239 --> 04:07:21.750 align:start position:0%
um in the Warren
article

04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
article
 
04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:24.229 align:start position:0%
article
yes

04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
fre thank you so much and and thank you
 
04:07:35.710 --> 04:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
for both of you for being here um on
 
04:07:38.910 --> 04:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
this tax cap I'm just curious was there
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
a municipality or town that came to you
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
and was in qu itive about doing this was
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
there a
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
problem somewhere in the state that
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
you're seeking to address or did you
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
just think that this would be a good way
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
to address this flaw in the current
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
statutes speaking for myself I did hear
 
04:08:03.389 --> 04:08:03.399 align:start position:0%
from a constituent who was concerned
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
that his town and I won't give you the
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
name of the town because I don't want to
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
get this person cause him any issues but
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
he was frustrated that his talent was
 
04:08:13.790 --> 04:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
not allowing him to adopt a uh school um
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh spending cap in the manner that um
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
they could adopt a municipal tax cap um
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave Senator representative
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
McGuire answer his question yeah I mean
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
my own constituents are uh very strongly
 
04:08:34.109 --> 04:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
in um needing and asking for something
 
04:08:36.830 --> 04:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
like this because I mean our our
 
04:08:40.269 --> 04:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
property tax bill our school our town is
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
great I mean they they they're flat
 
04:08:44.670 --> 04:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
funded this particular particular year
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
but my school is spending 10% more you
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
know I mean it's just amazing and uh so
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
my overall property tax is going to be
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
going up 8% this year right so that's
 
04:08:59.790 --> 04:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
that's people are are very very in favor
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
of this kind of
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
thing further
 
04:09:06.429 --> 04:09:06.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%

Christina frequent frequent uh flyer
 
04:09:31.389 --> 04:09:31.399 align:start position:0%

us thank you again chairman turock good
 
04:09:35.149 --> 04:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the of the
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
committee barer Christina for the New
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association um
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to the bill just to be
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
clear we're not opposed to tax caps uh
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that that should be left into
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
the hands of of local voters the
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that nhba has with the bill is
 
04:09:52.469 --> 04:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
that under current law a school district
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
can adopt either a tax cap or a spending
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
cap the law allows them to F to select
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
the voters to select either a fixed
 
04:10:02.910 --> 04:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount or a fixed percentage as
 
04:10:04.349 --> 04:10:04.359 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the bill if a school
 
04:10:06.189 --> 04:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
district does not currently have a tax
 
04:10:08.309 --> 04:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
cap but wanted to implement one they
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
would be tied to this particular formula
 
04:10:12.870 --> 04:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
nhba believes that the voters should be
 
04:10:15.030 --> 04:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
able to choose what number or what
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
percentage that they necessarily want
 
04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
rather than being tied down to a to a
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
particular statutory to a statuto
 
04:10:26.830 --> 04:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
formula um second um my understanding my
 
04:10:28.429 --> 04:10:28.439 align:start position:0%
research I could be wrong on this but I
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
believe there's only three school
 
04:10:31.950 --> 04:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
districts and not counting the cities I
 
04:10:34.030 --> 04:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
should say only three school districts
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
non- cities that have adopted local tax
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
caps so I understand that the
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative and the senator said
 
04:10:41.950 --> 04:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
they've heard this from constituents but
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
this room isn't filled with people
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
people clamoring for a new method or a
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
new version of a particular tax cap um
 
04:10:51.710 --> 04:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
so you know we we question the I believe
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the representative over here asked what
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
was sort of the impetus for this and I
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
understand that it's often a constituent
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
that asked for the bill to be put in but
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know there doesn't seem to be a
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide desire to change what what
 
04:11:08.189 --> 04:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
voters have been able to do for a number
 
04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
of years um the other aspects uh
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have I believe it's
 
04:11:14.399 --> 04:11:16.950 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have I believe it's
on

04:11:16.950 --> 04:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
page uh I
 
04:11:21.790 --> 04:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
apologize I believe it's on page two
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
line 32 and
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
33 um about uh the bonding issues and if
 
04:11:29.349 --> 04:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
if you have a bond that only the first
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
year payment on the bond is going to be
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
um calculated in the tax cap your firste
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
bond payment is often lower than some of
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
the remaining years um of the bond your
 
04:11:41.469 --> 04:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
first year uh Bond payments are often
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
used for engineering surveys and
 
04:11:47.149 --> 04:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
architecture fees and not sort of the
 
04:11:49.590 --> 04:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
the people on the ground like like we're
 
04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
like we can like we've been hearing all
 
04:11:53.229 --> 04:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
day across the street digging with with
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
with heavy machinery that's nhs's
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
experience anyway um so those are those
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
are just the two or three primary
 
04:12:05.349 --> 04:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
concerns that nsba has we believe that
 
04:12:07.030 --> 04:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
this is sort of limiting voter Choice
 
04:12:08.990 --> 04:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the voters being allowed to adopt
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
either a a flat number or a fixed
 
04:12:13.710 --> 04:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
percentage to being tied into one
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
particular formula and we think that the
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
voters should have some flexibility with
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
how they how they want to do that within
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
their within their own local tax cap and
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill thank
 
04:12:30.510 --> 04:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
question do you think it's fair to say
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers that are maybe
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
struggling with a lot of bills right now
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
inflation high taxes um they're not
 
04:12:42.429 --> 04:12:42.439 align:start position:0%
filling this room right now because
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
possibly they're at work and they
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
elected us to be their voice fair enough
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative absolutely thank
 
04:12:52.349 --> 04:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
you further
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:02.850 --> 04:13:02.860 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
up good afternoon again chairman turat
 
04:13:15.550 --> 04:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine heck and I
 
04:13:18.670 --> 04:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
Association and well um I believe uh the
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill who introduced the
 
04:13:27.550 --> 04:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
bill and did a great job um covering it
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
really summed up some of the work we did
 
04:13:31.630 --> 04:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
together in the Senate on this local
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
option I did want to just make sure I
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
was here to answer any questions and to
 
04:13:38.790 --> 04:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
just clarify a few points that I heard
 
04:13:41.389 --> 04:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
um one of the first questions I heard um
 
04:13:43.389 --> 04:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
well first let me also say that we are
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
really only concerned at nhma with the
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
section of the bill that goes up until
 
04:13:51.630 --> 04:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
page two line 10 because the rest really
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
applies to a school district and that is
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
just not the area that we get into but
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
we had sat with the sponsors when we saw
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
this bill to make sure that Not only was
 
04:14:02.429 --> 04:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
some language on a bill that we had
 
04:14:04.590 --> 04:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
worked on on in this body around tax
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
caps was included um in the first
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
section of the bill that was seen in
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
this committee but making sure that
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
there was some definitions put in and
 
04:14:17.309 --> 04:14:17.319 align:start position:0%
some understanding of different indices
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
and how they work so for example um we
 
04:14:23.790 --> 04:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that well CPI is an
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
excellent indicator for perhaps a school
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
district because it's often used for
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustments in colas it
 
04:14:32.670 --> 04:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
may not be as accurate of a measure as
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
the municipal cost index which estimates
 
04:14:37.630 --> 04:14:37.640 align:start position:0%
that they uh Municipal and County uh
 
04:14:39.630 --> 04:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
American city and county magazine rather
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
has been doing this for 60 years and
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
they use a weight ated indices using CPI
 
04:14:47.910 --> 04:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
construction index and Industrial
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
commodity index because we build roads
 
04:14:52.510 --> 04:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
we build Bridges there's buildings um
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
and so and the Consumer Price Index so
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
they merge all of those together and
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
have different weights using data that
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
shows that our typical budgets have less
 
04:15:06.429 --> 04:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
um salaries and benefits attached than
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
say a school district where we normally
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
see a higher percentage of the District
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
budget being attributed to salary and
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
benefits so that was a suggestion that
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
we appreciated that the sponsors um and
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
the committee um included in the bill um
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
another point that was brought up which
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
is a great question we also struggle
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
with when and where to get population
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
figures from so we did work with the
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this to ensure that they
 
04:15:36.269 --> 04:15:36.279 align:start position:0%
were using RSA 78a which is the same
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
measure because we needed some
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
standardized method that every city in
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
town or every town rather this doesn't
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
apply to cities could use in the event
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
that they choose locally to adopt this
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
option via the voter and this is used
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
for our meals and rooms population
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
numbers or Highway block grant numbers
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
and other formula grants this is the
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
same statute that's already being used
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
and applied to other types of Grants
 
04:16:02.109 --> 04:16:02.119 align:start position:0%
we're receiving so again we just wanted
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
the law to be very clear um should it be
 
04:16:06.189 --> 04:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
adopted that it could be
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
enacted I don't think I have any more
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
comments other than to say that all of
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
our concerns in technical issues unless
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
we've missed any were addressed in in
 
04:16:20.910 --> 04:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:20.920 --> 04:16:23.149 align:start position:0%
 
amendments

04:16:23.149 --> 04:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:16:25.469 --> 04:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
yell um did you say that you were
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor opposed or neutral we
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
are we are neutral on the bill it is a
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
legislation oh and I would I I should
 
04:16:43.109 --> 04:16:43.119 align:start position:0%
also add I heard about cities in tax
 
04:16:45.510 --> 04:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
caps cities in their Charters have got
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
to place in a tax cap provision as part
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
of their Charter process which is
 
04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
adopted by their legislative bodies and
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
several of our cities do use an
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
inflation index or an inflationary
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
measure as part of their tax cap so I
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
think this might have been some of the
 
04:17:06.109 --> 04:17:06.119 align:start position:0%
reason we're considering this option
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
here it's being used in several of the
 
04:17:07.800 --> 04:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
here it's being used in several of the
city

04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
city
 
04:17:13.109 --> 04:17:13.119 align:start position:0%
Charters representative kahill yes had a
 
04:17:16.950 --> 04:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
question about that um so you're stating
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
that the cities in their Charter have a
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
tax cap are they allowed to be a City
 
04:17:24.590 --> 04:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
without a tax cap I I
 
04:17:27.389 --> 04:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
believe we can ask n but I my
 
04:17:29.550 --> 04:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the charter has to
 
04:17:32.269 --> 04:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
um have some type of provision with
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
contained within it for their budgeting
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
purposes because they have elected
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
officials they have representative
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies they do not have a
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
town meeting the way our communities do
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
because they would not have a way to
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
override they don't have a overriding
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
tax cap the way our local towns can
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
actually override the tax cap in this
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislation has does not preclude that
 
04:17:57.309 --> 04:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
from happening either that stays the
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
law I see no other hands you're free to
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
go rep uh Miss heck thank
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
you okay uh last pink card I have is
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.670 --> 04:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members Eric
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
power from Brookline president of school
 
04:18:27.429 --> 04:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
district governance Association speaking
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill um I'm just gonna
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
I sent something out to the committee
 
04:18:33.750 --> 04:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
this morning you may or have it in your
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
box but I want to just kind of highlight
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
a few of the the the points about the
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
positive aspects of this bill and answer
 
04:18:43.990 --> 04:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
any questions that have come up um
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
section one talks about the local tax
 
04:18:50.830 --> 04:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
cap it's the existing RSA 32b hyphen 325
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
hyphen B it's really a tax effort cap
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
for people that aren't aware so what
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
you're limiting is the tax effort from
 
04:19:01.830 --> 04:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
year to year and currently the only
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
option is to do that by a fixed
 
04:19:08.309 --> 04:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
percentage or a fixed dollar amount so
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
the a tax effort is really your total
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
budget minus your estimated Revenue VES
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what's available today
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I have experience with tax caps um
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
in Brookline in 2016 for our Brookline
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
School District we adopted an 8% tax cap
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
on our school district we had originally
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
proposed it at the 4% level but there
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
was concern about potential
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
inflation voters like the idea of a tax
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
cap but they didn't they felt that
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
inflation sometime might go high and
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that came true so but they
 
04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
did so they did we did um adjust that at
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
the deliberative session under s SP2 and
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
it passed by the super majority vote of
 
04:19:54.990 --> 04:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
60% needed more than 60% so this has got
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be a very much of an agreement for a
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
town to do this it's not just a simple
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
majority so what this bill does is it
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
gives you other other options doesn't
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
take that one away those are still
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
available if you want the fix percentage
 
04:20:08.990 --> 04:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
or the fixed dollar amount this just
 
04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
gives one that's makes a lot more sense
 
04:20:13.870 --> 04:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know risk in terms of
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
you could have uh you can go with the
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
inflation factor that you choose for
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
your town MCI is a great one the EC
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
employment cost index is another popular
 
04:20:22.960 --> 04:20:23.950 align:start position:0%
employment cost index is another popular
one

04:20:23.950 --> 04:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
CPI you can choose that instead of a
 
04:20:27.319 --> 04:20:28.510 align:start position:0%
CPI you can choose that instead of a
fixed

04:20:28.510 --> 04:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
percentage and um the other thing that
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
happens with the local tax cap is that a
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
if you get more revenues you can
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
increase your budget so it because it's
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
limiting tax effort but if if you get
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
more Revenue you can raise your spending
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's because the net would be the same
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
under the tax cap um the one thing
 
04:20:53.229 --> 04:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
that's not the greatest piece of about
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
the tax cap is you adopt it with a super
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
majority but it can be overridden by a
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
simple majority at the town meeting or
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
School District meeting but that's the
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
way it is right now we're not trying to
 
04:21:03.960 --> 04:21:04.990 align:start position:0%
way it is right now we're not trying to
change

04:21:04.990 --> 04:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:21:09.269 --> 04:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
that so the second part of the bill in
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
section two talks about School District
 
04:21:13.389 --> 04:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
budget cap
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a spending cap so that
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually looks at how much you're
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
spending regardless of income again that
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
one has to be adopted by a 60% super
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
majority and that is done by selecting a
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
cost per
 
04:21:31.109 --> 04:21:31.119 align:start position:0%
student whatever your whatever cost per
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
student you what the the legislative
 
04:21:35.870 --> 04:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
body wants they pick a cost per student
 
04:21:37.750 --> 04:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then they multiply by the number of
 
04:21:40.109 --> 04:21:40.119 align:start position:0%
students which we use the uh Department
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
of Education average daily member ship
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
in Residence
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
admr and then also an inflation Factor
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
just like you could choose in the in the
 
04:21:50.429 --> 04:21:50.439 align:start position:0%
local tax
 
04:21:53.469 --> 04:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
cap again it puts a limit on the total
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
budget and spending so if you get more
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
revenues you don't get to increase the
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
budget that some people like that some
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
people don't like that but what that
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
would do is if you got higher revenues
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
it would actually go back to the
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers as tax relief that's what's
 
04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
built in there it limits the spending
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
you have the spending if you get more
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
revenues then it goes down and reduces
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
the tax effort which reduces taxes some
 
04:22:19.389 --> 04:22:19.399 align:start position:0%
people like it some people don't um in
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
general you know higher revenues so
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
higher revenues don't raise the budget
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
cap higher
 
04:22:26.790 --> 04:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
inflation will raise it because that's
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's a factor there and if you have
 
04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
more students it goes up but if you have
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
less students that's a factor that makes
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
it go down so again with this with this
 
04:22:38.990 --> 04:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
School District budget cap it was
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
authored to uh be overridden with a
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
three- fifth super majority so you have
 
04:22:45.229 --> 04:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
to stay within the cap unless your
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body get your town meeting
 
04:22:48.750 --> 04:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
or your deliberative session decides to
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.710 --> 04:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
majority and there is a there is a trend
 
04:22:57.309 --> 04:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire right now if you look
 
04:22:59.550 --> 04:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
across the state that there's School
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
spending the motivation for this there
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
school spending is going up but the
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
populations are going down and the cost
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
per student is rising so there's clearly
 
04:23:10.030 --> 04:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh a need for some taxpayers and some
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
school districts to want this um
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
I sent to you a graph I I served on a
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
stud what they call the bucom study
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee in Brooklyn I was the chairman
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
of it in 2020 and what we did is we
 
04:23:24.670 --> 04:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
looked at we were looking at the impacts
 
04:23:26.429 --> 04:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
of a budget committee but one of the
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
factors we did was we looked at what was
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
happening with school districts peer
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
school districts and peer towns and with
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
towns we were looking at how much has
 
04:23:38.349 --> 04:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
the spending gone up compared to
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
inflation and the growth in population
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
and for school districts we looking at
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening with inflation and the
 
04:23:48.510 --> 04:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
number of students and in for the school
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
districts we had 27 peer school
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
districts over 70% were exceeding the
 
04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
what you would expect for uh a budget
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
going up based on inflation and uh
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
student enrollment which only 30% were
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
staying underneath that so there's CLE
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
clearly a need there I also have a graph
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
in there showing an example of um a
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
budget cap School District budget cap
 
04:24:15.630 --> 04:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
and a local tax cap adopted with CPI
 
04:24:17.070 --> 04:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
what it would look like and really it's
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
not drastic and it's not crazy but it
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
causes small changes to happen over time
 
04:24:23.429 --> 04:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
so you're you don't get runaway budgets
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
today the um there the in the in the the
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh package I emailed you this morning
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
there's also a couple of examples
 
04:24:40.510 --> 04:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
showing how the School District budget
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
cap Works based on change ing
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
enrollments and inflation factors
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether you have a fixed number or
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're using an inflation Factor so you
 
04:24:50.910 --> 04:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
can see how it works it's all in all
 
04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
part of the um the packet I sent you and
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
I can answer questions if you have any
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
other detailed questions on that but I
 
04:25:01.109 --> 04:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
think it makes a lot of sense to have a
 
04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap that'll be much more
 
04:25:05.550 --> 04:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
popular than what we have today today
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
there's I think there's seven towns and
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
three school districts that have adopted
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap primarily because you
 
04:25:12.990 --> 04:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
can only pick the fixed percentage
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
or you can pick the fixed dollar amount
 
04:25:17.070 --> 04:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
so this actually gives something that
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
vot more voters would come on board with
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
um because they would realize they'll be
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
protected from inflation if we get
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
inflation the tax Capital will go up
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
with it and that makes a lot more sense
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
so it would be a lot more popular um so
 
04:25:31.710 --> 04:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
I would recommend um aop pass with
 
04:25:33.550 --> 04:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment on this bill I think it's a
 
04:25:35.910 --> 04:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
great tool it is enabling legislation it
 
04:25:37.950 --> 04:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
has to be adopted by a 60% super
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
majority so no one's going to be forced
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
to use it but it is a tool that's
 
04:25:44.030 --> 04:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
available to towns and school districts
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you questions
 
04:25:46.720 --> 04:25:48.149 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you questions
representative

04:25:48.149 --> 04:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
stavis just wondering in all of your
 
04:25:55.389 --> 04:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
calculations of school expenditures and
 
04:25:58.510 --> 04:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment profil and the like how did
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts factor
 
04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
into that they're they're
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
independent is there an estimate of
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
what people are paying for
 
04:26:12.750 --> 04:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
those that's not part of local school
 
04:26:12.760 --> 04:26:13.950 align:start position:0%
those that's not part of local school
district

04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
spending so it's it doesn't impact tax
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you very much
 
04:26:28.990 --> 04:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:26:31.710 --> 04:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that was the last pink card I
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
had on S SP 383 I see nobody else
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
jumping up to come speak so with that we
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on SB 383
 
04:26:47.550 --> 04:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
all right um that's it for today again
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday 9:30 we will hear two bills
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the morning and then start uh
 
04:26:56.750 --> 04:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
executing some of these bills
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
here uh one of them we were informed
 
04:27:01.149 --> 04:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
today that it's an early bill which
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
means uh SP 385 which we haven't heard
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
yet we will hear next Tuesday we have to
 
04:27:11.469 --> 04:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
get it out on Tuesday so be prepared to
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
possibly along day or be prepared for
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
that one other than that enjoy your
