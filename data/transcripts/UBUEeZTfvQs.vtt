00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
I've got this amendment here is that
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
what you're disc no I believe we're
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
doing a we're doing oh I'm sorry let me
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
back up real fast um the way we're going
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
to do the bills today is first thing
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do is go through
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
things that I think are going to be
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
unanimous um or are
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
immovable um so we won't be going in the
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
order as listed on there um we're going
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
to go people need to pay attention but
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through the things
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
that I imagine we have debated furiously
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
before um and and are not going to move
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
on so it's obviously up to the committee
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
if they want to change but hav been
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
doing this now for 3 years I think I
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
know how things are going to shck out so
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
we are on HB 333 which uh are you now
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
ready for to be recognized
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
representative prud O'Brien uh yes I um

weie is seconding that motion I am is
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
there any discussion on the
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think that we're going to get
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
to this subject of the State primary
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
election and some other bills that we
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
have today so that is uh why I think we
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
can ital this it's wise to do so there
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
it there we go thank you I think I gave
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
all right so we are on discussion of
 
00:44:56.599 --> 00:45:00.150 align:start position:0%
all right so we are on discussion of
Amendment

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
2023-24 um representative katav you're
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to your Amendment
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I think this is
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
another bill that we could probably all
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
agree on we need to make sure that our
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
elections are accurate it was intended
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
to already do this if you look in the
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
election manual however the RSA on it
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear and so this is the exact
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
tabulation definition that came out of
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
the election ual and I know that there
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
had been a little bit of concern about
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
not being clear um that the central
 
00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
polling location counting could also
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
still happen and so that was explicitly
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
put into this me uh amendment that the
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
final results of an election in a
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
polling place or at the central polling
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
location as provided in RSA
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
65959 and I did want to point out uh I
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
was there in wiam at the primary and
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards our vote was was ret
 
00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
afterwards our vote was was ret
tabulated

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
tabulated
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and uh when the announcement
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
came out it was actually post the period
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
where you could even request a recount
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
and thankfully the the other candidate
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
who had already requested a recount
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
didn't cancel the recount otherwise we
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have known that it was wrong so
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's really important that we do
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
this uh especially you know when we're
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
talking about primaries in order to
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
request a recount you can only request a
 
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
recount of the votes within 10 votes or
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
one and a half %c and I know in Windam I
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
4% of my votes were were hand count
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
votes so uh we we really just want to
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that the the elections uh are
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
accurate and they've already had a great
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
way of of counting for us in public and
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
so now they'll just be doing the final
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
tabulation for us right there so thank
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
you okay is there a further discussion
 
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
amendment yes um yes representative
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
Hamlet thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.430 align:start position:0%
Hamlet thank you Mr chair and thank you
representative

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so my question is the the tape is is
 
00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:04.839 align:start position:0%
it still unofficial that's an it's an
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
unofficial result
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
so um why should that be
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
posted for the public to view if if it's
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
an unofficial result because the the
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
handc count votes and the and the you
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
know absentee ballot some of the some of
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
the votes haven't been included in that
 
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.670 align:start position:0%
the votes haven't been included in that
final

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
tabulation I I can I can answer it for
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
the% if you'd like um so this is a this
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
last provision is my provision um this
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
transparency as you know I've been after
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
this for some time um the reality is so
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
for there's multiple reasons why to
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
answer your question um it is The
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
Unofficial it's not the final um it is
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
The Unofficial it is not the final um it
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
is only official for that it's not
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
official it's only posted for that
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
machine right so the the issue at hand
 
00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:54.270 align:start position:0%
machine right so the the issue at hand
is

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
twofold there is is multiple ways in
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
which towns and cities are handling
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
these tapes and countings right so some
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
cities and towns uh immediately after
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
the polls of closed and the last ballot
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
has been cast they immediately print the
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
summary tapes and they immediately read
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
The Unofficial tape results I really
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
like that um that makes life a lot
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
easier for everybody awaiting those
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
results because most of our elections
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
are not decided um by a small margin
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
most of them are one way or the other um
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
the other concern is that with the
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
centralized counting you are packing up
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
these machines they are going out of
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
sight they are going into a car they are
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
being transported they are being
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
unloaded somewhere else and then they
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
are being run somewhere else um and that
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
invites speculation um I'm actually
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
surprised nobody has raised that as
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
speculation yet um but it does just
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
invite it the machine is out of sight
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
for a period of time so it's a twofer um
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
number one is we are going to get the
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
results for let's call it 80% of New
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's elections um within 30
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
minutes of the respective ballot closing
 
00:48:58.109 --> 00:48:58.119 align:start position:0%
and number two is we are going to um
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
preemptively stop uh speculation being
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
raised about what happened when the
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
machine was unplugged and moved um so
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
does that sufficiently answer the
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
question well I have a follow-up
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
question so I should should it not be
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
clarified in in this amendment
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
that you know announcing the the total
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
Vote or posting the the total votes is
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
the unofficial results so it's it's not
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
necessary because they're not posted as
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
the official results and some like I
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
said some cities and towns are already
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
doing this so if
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
they're my statement to representative
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
would be if you're concerned about the
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
confusion you should probably be
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
concerned the confusion is already
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
occurring so it hasn't been a problem
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
for my understanding is most cities and
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
towns actually do it like this um we're
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of bringing everybody up
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
online um the the example I always give
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
is Salem New Hampshire has I think five
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
voting location
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
um maybe three whatever they have more
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
than one um and they do a centralized
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
counting so what Salem does is they pick
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
up all their machines they move them all
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
to a centralized counting location where
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
it all happens kind of in secret um and
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
then they release their results at about
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
1:00 in the
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
morning totally unnecessary for Salem
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um if you know the makeup
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
of that town that election goes One Way
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
normally um totally unnecessary and we
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
don't need to be waiting till 1:00 in
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
the morning to get those results um so
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes it is unofficial there's nothing
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be posted that says
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
these are the official counts uh the
 
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
laws about the return of votes still all
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
stays the same um but for those
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives looking to go home
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not knowing they've won or
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
lost an election night uh they won't
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to wait till 10 or 11 or in my case
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
when I used to represent Manchester and
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
Lichfield I had to wait till 1:00 in the
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
morning to find out that I had won my
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
election um for literally no Reas reason
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
I won by 800 votes it wasn't close um so
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to there there's really no
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
reason in New Hampshire we can't have
 
00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
80% of our results by 8:30 at night um
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
in this state everything else it's just
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be uniform it's going to
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
be better and I I guess uh you know
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
trust but verify me on this uh you're
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to like this a lot
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
better okay thank you uh representative
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you Mr chair um couple of
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
things have been I just want to draw
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
attention to um I
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um feeling of impatience
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
when we have to wait for election
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
results and as a candidate I know um it
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
is you know we're on pins and needles
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
waiting for those results I can agree
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
with what you're saying that it's it's
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
hard to wait um but is it not important
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
or more important to have accurate final
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
results released and does it not create
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
more speculation if you release
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
unofficial results um ahead of those
 
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
unofficial results um ahead of those
final

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
results I'm just saying so it's already
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
happening most towns and cities are
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
already doing this so this just brings
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
all the other towns who kind of refuse
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
to do their work in public and quickly
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
um up to spec with what the other towns
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
are doing um my counter punt counter
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
punch that would be if the tape comes
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
out and it says it's close you're going
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
to hang around for the official results
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
if the tape comes out and it's a blowout
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
you're either going to go celebrate or
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
Drown Your Sorrows um but there's no you
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
know we're not there's going to be no
 
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation that this is a
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
official final result this these tapes
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
are going to be made public anyways um
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
because they are public documents
 
00:52:53.549 --> 00:52:53.559 align:start position:0%
they're going to made public anyways the
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
question is is when are they going to be
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
made public public are they going to be
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
made public 30 minutes after the last
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
ballot is run through the machine or are
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
they going to be made public at 1:00 in
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
the morning um either way the different
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
components of this bill are going to be
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
made the different components that go
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
into the tabulation of the votes for the
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
return of votes for the secretary state
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
is made public um and just following up
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
on my colleague um representative Hamlet
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
should it not then say in here that
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
these are unofficial results to make it
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
clear if we're putting this type of
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
language into law
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
so it my my Counterpoint to that would
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
be if they're already doing it we don't
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
already require that they already say
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
this is just the machines only and
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's what the language reads is the
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
long tape the long report tape it
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the official results it
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the unofficial results it
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
says it is a posting of the tape um and
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
it's by a machine so it's going to be
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to see four different tapes
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
or however many machines are at the
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
location are going to be posted and
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
you're still going to have to do math um
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
but you're going to know what's going on
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
um you know any the concerns to not
 
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.470 align:start position:0%
um you know any the concerns to not
posting

00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
posting
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
these the concern to not posting these
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
tapes it's already happening over half
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
of our locations that I'm aware of are
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
already posting these tapes and already
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
reading them um and people are already
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
hanging around 15 minutes after the
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
polls close with their writing down the
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
tape results um it's just why not make
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
it uniform across the
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
board um different municipalities do
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
things differently it's local control
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
and we do have an issue or I have an
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
issue with the 30 minute time frame
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
there are many times when the tabulation
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
of results um takes longer than 30
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
minutes it is not just the tape that
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
reports out the results it is the
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
election volunteers who are counting
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
hand counting wrin votes and so if you
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
only are doing the tape within that 30
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
minute time frame you are potentially
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
missing out on many votes that could be
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
hand counted as wenss that might affect
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the election and therei
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
therefore be misleading the candidates
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
or anyone who might be reading that tape
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
only and not waiting for the final
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
results after the tabulation occurs by
 
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.470 align:start position:0%
results after the tabulation occurs by
the

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
volunteers who are counting the
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
writings correct and that I'll second
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
represent kab and that would be the
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
decision of the candidate not to around
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
that are you not making it more
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
difficult for election workers who um
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know oftentimes are there for many
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
hours and who now are on a time crunch
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
of 30 minutes what happens what is the
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
result if a uh election worker election
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
officials does not post this within 30
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
minutes is there a penalty for that or a
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
consequence there is Not By Design and
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
there are many pieces of election law
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
and election procedure that do not hold
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
a penalty for not following them this
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
would be one of them um but that's and
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's okay and to answer your question
 
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
about are you burdening them the
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
printing of the tapes Takes a Minute it
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
takes one minute and they are doing it
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
anyways they have to print the tapes
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
anyways to do their tabulation of votes
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
so they print the tapes after the last
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
ballot is through not when polls close
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
after the last ballot is through because
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes it voting is occurring after
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
the polls have closed so it's after the
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
last ballot is thow through then they
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
have 30 minutes
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
to go over and click
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
print and then they have 30 minutes to
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
walk over and put a piece of Scotch tape
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
on the tape and put it on the
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
door and how does this impact the many
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are hand count only
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect them at all so then we
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
still have a difference uh we are not
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
doing something Universal that would
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
apply to all municipalities only those
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
who have um ballot counting devices so
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
the claim that this would make it
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
Universal or um you know apply to
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
everyone and that you're trying to solve
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
an issue where there are towns doing
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
this now towns that are not doing it and
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're trying to make it equal among
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
those it's still not equal because you
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
still have hand count towns that are not
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
affected by this and therefore it is not
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
a universal rule correct and I will end
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
our back and forth with this which is it
 
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
universally applies to every town which
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
has chosen to use a machine
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative katab
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to State I did talk to
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
a a couple of the clerks yesterday who
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
do currently already do this and they
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
said when they post them up they just
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
let people know these are the tape
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
readouts only these are not official
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
results they make it very clear and one
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the clerks said you know we'll even
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
point out like there's still this big
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
stack of of hand count votes so the
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
results very well may change and they
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
just make it clear to everybody that's
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
there and I do want to say like it is
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
very clear that it's only if RSA 659752
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
applies which is the um enabling
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows the towns to use
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
the machines and I think what R Barry or
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
chairman Barry was trying to say was
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
that you know for the towns that are
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
using these machines for them to all be
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
doing it the same way that way we don't
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
have some doing it one way and some
 
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
doing it another it's just opening up
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
transparency that's
 
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
all thank you Mr chair also it doesn't
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
affect all those things that have to be
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
handc counted they can go on till four
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning like I've done
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
um but just for the tape for those
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
people running for office they now can
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
hey I can go home now because I was out
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
all day uh so but if I'm close if
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
there's only maybe 20 votes between me
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
and my opponent yeah I'd better stay
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
until to or get somebody to phone me uh
 
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
and in our town well in Ros Berry's
 
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
District which includes litfield and two
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
Wards in Manchester Manchester does
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
this the current moderator in litfield
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
doeses not so he had to wait for
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
litfield to vote to see if he won the
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
problem is the previous moderator used
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
to do it and then we got new moderator
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't do it until the final vote
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
was counted so so yeah this way I'd like
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
it because hey let's see if I can go
 
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
home now you know main thing but yeah
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
let's see and if I'm won by 300 votes
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
then I know
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
I won
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
yeah okay further discussion on the bill
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment excuse me first the amendment
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you I guess I'm
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
still um when I read line six the new
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
language are we not still requiring when
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
they bring them together as they do in
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
many of the
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
cities that that be done in
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
public R kab thank you Mr Mr chairman
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so this um no
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
this would be if you
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
are this is when you're adding the
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
actual results together if you're doing
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
them either at the individual polling
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
place or at the central polling location
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
this isn't requiring for the towns like
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
NASA that do them all at individual
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
locations this is the aggregation just
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
of the results from the long report and
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
the Hand count so you're not this isn't
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
I try to put the statue in there just to
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
be really clear that right and I that
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's still absolutely lot and I took
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
this wording out of the election manual
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so there's another sentence which
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
then talks about the tabulating of
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
the you know different polling location
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
results and that's explicitly not in
 
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
here because to your concern about um
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know that may be difficult for
 
01:00:52.109 --> 01:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
certain towns so uh so piggy back on
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
that res talk you took this language out
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
of the C law manual correct so this is
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
what's already supposed to be currently
 
01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.349 align:start position:0%
what's already supposed to be currently
being

01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
done thank you okay representative
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
brenon thank you I wonder if this is
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
something that really requires a law and
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
I wonder if perhaps the Secretary of
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
State might as he's conducting trainings
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
with our election officials throughout
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
the state perhaps he might suggest to
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
them that it is not illegal to post the
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
tape is that correct it is not in law
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
that um that municipalities cannot post
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
the tape I I don't believe there
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
anything posting about the tapes um so I
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
I just I wonder if this is really a
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
necessary law or if it is perhaps just
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
something that could be suggested by the
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to election officials
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
rather than putting them on the clock of
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
the 30
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
minutes um
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
I just worry that this might create more
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
problems than it's trying to solve and
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps a suggestion rather than a law
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
would resolve the issue that um you're
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
trying to solve representative
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
wey uh thank you chairman uh the
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office has
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
repeatedly stated that the training that
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
is provided is poorly attended and that
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think there would be problems with
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
counting on the training and the
 
01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:33.789 align:start position:0%
counting on the training and the
compliance

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:35.549 align:start position:0%
compliance
to

01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:35.559 --> 01:02:38.230 align:start position:0%
to
overcome

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
overcome
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
um this deficiency and knowledge by
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
moderators and clerks and so forth I
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're not attending the
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
training now and if we're expecting
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
training to cover up a gap in in the
 
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
rsas then I I think we're counting on
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
training sorry representative Brennan
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um it's my understanding that
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state is able to send
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
out memos and emails to moderators and
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
town clerks and perhaps would consider
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
writing an email or memo saying that it
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
is perfectly okay to post the tape
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
following an election and a law would
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
not be necessary to make that so
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you my my counter punch to that
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
would be uh I don't like giving away our
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
policymaking to an executive um so I
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
that is a personal philosophical view um
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
I do if you've ever followed me I rail
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
on the bureaucracy creating rules um all
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
the time because that is our job um so I
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
I view that um respectfully as a
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
dereliction of Duty it is our job to
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
write the policies it is not the job of
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
the executive or the
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%

2379 H um which is an amendment to House
 
01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:01.910 align:start position:0%
2379 H um which is an amendment to House
Bill

01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
476 okay uh and then I will speak to my
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
so this stems from the recount
 
01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
so this stems from the recount
of

01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
um um Manchester Ward 6 in which a stack
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
of votes was missed during the recount
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
and it changed the outcome of the
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
election uh there was then an ensuing
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
legal battle um to count all of the
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
votes U and I don't want to open up the
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
old wound on that um but it was not an
 
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
inexpensive legal battle for the
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
prevailing side um and so what I am
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
seeking to do is
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
address this so it doesn't have to go
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
back to court again um and I do know
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
that the argument is going to be made
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
made that after the victory in court um
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
estab a precedent has been established
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
and all that um but the reality is is
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
anything can be taken to court our
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
current law does say no second recount
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
um so either way if this situation
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
happens again where it is objectively
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
determined that and that's not my take
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
on it that was the Court's take on it um
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
that is objectively determined that not
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
all the ballots were counted um it
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop someone from attempting to
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
stop the secretary of state from doing
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
that in court again so what I have done
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
is drafted an amendment only uh drafted
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
a bill only to state general elections
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
so nothing else just state general
 
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
elections which says that if the recount
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
shows that the outcome of the election
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
has changed which basically means the
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
the winner is no longer the winner and
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
there is a new winner right so not the
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
results change so the the number of
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
votes didn't change like the number of
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
votes that always changes in a recount
 
01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:49.719 align:start position:0%
um but the actual winner changes um then
 
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
there shall be a second recount so so
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
the my rationale behind this is if the
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
outcome changes if there are new winners
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
both sides are going to put a lot of
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
scrutiny on the second and what is
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
labeled the final recount so that gives
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
both sides an opportunity maybe they
 
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
weren't fully engaged I don't know or
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
maybe there was a dispute um but it
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
allows both sides to bring their
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
resources to Bear during a required
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
second recount versus going to the court
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and begging for a second recount um
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
this you know probably you know if you
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
look at the number of Elections that
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
changed outcomes this year I think this
 
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
would have only applied to three um in
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
total um so we're not adding a whole
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of new recounts um it's not after
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
speaking with Secretary of State's
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
office they had concerns my original
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
Bill had it at the discretion of the
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State the Secretary of
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
State um informed me that he didn't want
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
the discretion um and I tended to agree
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
with him on that which is we don't want
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
um accusations flying that the Secretary
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
of State should or should not have
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
called for a second recount so the idea
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
here is we are going to get it right uh
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
it does not go on in perpetuity um so if
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
that second recount that's it that's it
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's over after the second recount but
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
if the winner changes there shall be
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
another counting to make sure that the
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
change that was determined by the
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
recount was accurate and it's the final
 
01:23:22.159 --> 01:23:23.070 align:start position:0%
recount was accurate and it's the final
one

01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's my that's what my Amendment
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
does um and I said I'm I'm more than
 
01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
happy to explain uh my experience I do
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
represent Manchester Ward 6 although it
 
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
was not my election um and I can say it
 
01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
was a very um not awesome experience so
 
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
with that are there other comments on
 
01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:45.330 align:start position:0%
the on house Amendment 2023
 
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:47.149 align:start position:0%

copies all right representative Lane you
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
recognize to speak to um Amendment 2023
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
23668 right so um what this bill does is
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
give the Secretary of State the
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
authorization to use the money in an
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
equitable way um up to um 3 million uh
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
over three years so there's a Sunset and
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
um it the secretary of state would set
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
up um a way to do this again equitably
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
um if if he needs to use the if he so
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
chooses to do and um for those of us who
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
um the Hava funds are funds that came in
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
for help America vot vot um there's an
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
obligation in our existing statute um I
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
think to keep 12 times the money right
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
now there's that would be around if I
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on the numbers but
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
there's around three million there that
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
that is an excess of what um has to be
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
there under existing statute this gives
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State the ability to
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
use that for specifically for the voting
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
election voting
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
machines further discussion on the amend
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%

thankful this amendments come forward as
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know I am a um a big proponent of
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
getting this done um I know that there
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
was uh support on U my my um cuses in to
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
um make these funds less discretionary
 
01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:12.760 align:start position:0%

uh with that um the clerk will call the
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%

01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
HB um 115 which is with discussions on
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
amendments intertwined with HB 345 and
 
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.229 align:start position:0%
amendments intertwined with HB 345 and
HB

01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
350 um giving deference to in respect to
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
the respective caucuses I know they want
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
to meet one more time and discuss that
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
um also it sounds like there's a need to
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
caucus on for the respective parties on
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
hp16 um and HB
 
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
243 and we are are still awaiting an
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
amendment for HB
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
463 so that puts us in this situation of
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
we're near
 
01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.629 align:start position:0%
we're near
lunch

01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think representative Lane um
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
would you be okay if we just broke for
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
lunch and the various teams can discuss
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
over lunch with their own caucuses um
 
01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we're going to get
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
this done in time um and then you know
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
how I feel about lunch yes do um so
 
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we will do we will recess
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
until um Call of the chair which will be
 
01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.390 align:start position:0%
until um Call of the chair which will be
at

01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
12 let it 45 or 30 an hour an hour and
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
15 I have a one o'clock meeting but I
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
can handle it's okay all right we'll do
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
a 12:30 um because I can always extend
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
it so the we will stand in recess until
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
12:30 um for prospective caucuses and
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
some much needed lunch and most
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%

confusion um next up we will do that was
 
02:41:05.309 --> 02:41:05.319 align:start position:0%

02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%

executive session for House Bill uh 243
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
um we were on discussion as the
 
02:41:22.990 --> 02:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um so we do need to dispense
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
with the original Amendment before we
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
can take up what I believe will be a new
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment um so we were on this is where
 
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
my confusion came from last time for
 
02:41:35.870 --> 02:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.830 --> 02:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment um excuse me
 
02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
2384 um so we need to if we are to take
 
02:41:46.030 --> 02:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
up another amendment we first must
 
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
dispense with this amendment or I guess
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
you can withdraw the motion all right
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%

an amendment for the committee um which
 
02:46:26.830 --> 02:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
I know there it is um n that's the wrong
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment the old Amendment let me give
 
02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:31.640 align:start position:0%

02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
it is I am going to move Amendment 2023
 
02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:37.269 align:start position:0%
it is I am going to move Amendment 2023
23

02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:46:42.030 --> 02:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
81h um I need a second on this right um
 
02:46:43.469 --> 02:46:43.479 align:start position:0%
represent B can you give me a second
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we are now on discussion
 
02:46:50.910 --> 02:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
on Amendment 2023 H 2023 2381 a lot of
 
02:46:56.269 --> 02:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
2023 202 2023 23 81h uh to houseb 116
 
02:46:58.349 --> 02:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
and I'll speak to it real fast um so
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is very simple um it get gets rid
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
of any changing of the existing petition
 
02:47:08.670 --> 02:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for third party or major
 
02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
party we got a lot of push back on that
 
02:47:13.389 --> 02:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
so the current petition requirements for
 
02:47:15.790 --> 02:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
ballot access stay exactly as they are
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
right now um and then it increases the
 
02:47:21.950 --> 02:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
filing fees for United States Senate and
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
United States Congress um from $100 to
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
$2,500 and $50 to $1,250 respectively
 
02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
and eliminates the filing fee for state
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative so it takes it from a
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
grand total of $2 from a grand total of
 
02:47:42.269 --> 02:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
$0 um and I'm happy to explain why um so
 
02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
for state representative the I do not
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
care what the the municipal Association
 
02:47:48.269 --> 02:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
says there is zero chance that they are
 
02:47:50.190 --> 02:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
processing a $2 transaction and not
 
02:47:52.830 --> 02:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
losing money on it um they can't there
 
02:47:54.710 --> 02:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
is no way they can account for that
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
$2 and not net lose $2 um so that's why
 
02:48:02.349 --> 02:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
that changed um $2 is you can't even get
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
a Coke for that anymore to restaurant so
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
just get get rid of that um and then
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
with a discussion amongst members it
 
02:48:09.950 --> 02:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
seemed like uh that was going to be a
 
02:48:11.469 --> 02:48:11.479 align:start position:0%
non-starter so I went for the other
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
stuff um which was changing the filing
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
fees for representative for Congress and
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
US Senate um the thought process being
 
02:48:21.389 --> 02:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
here is um if you know $50 to file for
 
02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
United States Congress to then go handle
 
02:48:26.349 --> 02:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
a um what is it a $ 33 trillion budget
 
02:48:29.070 --> 02:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
or something um you know it just it's
 
02:48:30.429 --> 02:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
time to raise these so when these were
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
originally put in if you were to
 
02:48:34.030 --> 02:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
extrapolate these out for inflation they
 
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be much higher than they are even
 
02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
in this amendment um but just kind of
 
02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know leaving people running for
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
serious office to having serious you
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
know I would I would make the statement
 
02:48:46.030 --> 02:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
that that even 1250 is not necessarily a
 
02:48:48.429 --> 02:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
serious resource but at least make it to
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
where it's not um makes it a little more
 
02:48:54.910 --> 02:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
painful to file as a joke um so you can
 
02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
still get on with your petition
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
signatures that stays exactly the same
 
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
ironically enough if you know the cost
 
02:49:00.590 --> 02:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
of petition signature it costs much more
 
02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:01.630 align:start position:0%
of petition signature it costs much more
than

02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
$1,250 to collect that many petition
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
signatures um but I view this as a very
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable um bump up um you know we
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
original bill was $10,000 and people
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
really gave a lot of push back on that
 
02:49:15.550 --> 02:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a
 
02:49:17.550 --> 02:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
um it's not even in the middle ground
 
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
it's like a happy bottom quarter uh
 
02:49:22.389 --> 02:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
agreement to kind of keep things keep
 
02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
keep things people putting their name on
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
the ballot are going to be more serious
 
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
about it when it's 1,250 bucks instead
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
of $100 which is probably less than some
 
02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
Babs at tandies so um open up to I'm
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
obviously open up to more discussion on
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment um people can tell me why
 
02:49:40.349 --> 02:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong and I'm cool with that
 
02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
too yes representative Howard thank you
 
02:49:44.950 --> 02:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you fell
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh I I'm very against
 
02:49:50.349 --> 02:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment because I still feel that
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
we should be allowing ballot access for
 
02:49:55.349 --> 02:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
people especially when we have the cost
 
02:49:57.429 --> 02:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
of uh running to be on the presidential
 
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
primary is only
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh I understand the fact that
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
there are reasons why certain people uh
 
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't want others to run and why uh
 
02:50:09.710 --> 02:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
making it more difficult for people to
 
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
access their party primaries uh would
 
02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
allow for uh candidates of a more spefic
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
spefic choice but I don't think that's
 
02:50:17.710 --> 02:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily what we should be doing even
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
if people are quote unquote joke
 
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
candidates they may be providing real uh
 
02:50:24.309 --> 02:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
commentary on what's happening in our
 
02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
state and I think that they should have
 
02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to run for office uh at
 
02:50:30.750 --> 02:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
a price tag that is less than that
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
thousand to run for
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
president further discussion on the
 
02:50:38.229 --> 02:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
amendment ah representative Mirad I
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
can't this will be I'm sure en
 
02:50:42.309 --> 02:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
lightninging well I just qu question do
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know how many frivolous candidates
 
02:50:47.229 --> 02:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
uh races like the governorship are
 
02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
eliciting uh governorship not so much
 
02:50:50.550 --> 02:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's usually actually the federal
 
02:50:53.950 --> 02:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
Offices that tends to attract the um uh
 
02:50:55.790 --> 02:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
the far out theirs U you know it's not
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
once again it's not about limiting
 
02:50:59.670 --> 02:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
somebody's ability to get their message
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
out they can still do that um nothing
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
stops them from doing that getting their
 
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
message out nothing stops them from
 
02:51:06.229 --> 02:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
mounting a writing campaign or raising
 
02:51:06.239 --> 02:51:07.870 align:start position:0%
mounting a writing campaign or raising
12,

02:51:07.870 --> 02:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
12,
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
$1,250 um it's just a matter of there is
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
a cost to have someone on the ballot
 
02:51:13.349 --> 02:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
there a cost the state con cures a cost
 
02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
of that um this by the way even at 2500
 
02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
does not cover those costs um but it at
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
least stops it to where we're more
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
serious about what we're doing um the
 
02:51:25.030 --> 02:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
way things are going but um my
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
Counterpoint to representative Howard um
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
would be you know I have an amendment
 
02:51:32.910 --> 02:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
that leaves the current fees in place
 
02:51:34.309 --> 02:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
but only gets rid of the state
 
02:51:36.190 --> 02:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative fee would you be in favor
 
02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:37.349 align:start position:0%
representative fee would you be in favor
of

02:51:37.349 --> 02:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:51:41.309 --> 02:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
that uh I would okay uh representative
 
02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
BM in the in the last election I believe
 
02:51:44.200 --> 02:51:45.110 align:start position:0%
BM in the in the last election I believe
for

02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:51:47.550 --> 02:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
cd2 Congress there were like I think
 
02:51:50.229 --> 02:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
seven people signed up and effectively
 
02:51:51.710 --> 02:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
there were only three people running
 
02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
never ever saw the other four so there
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
is a problem of just people putting the
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
name on the ballot just like the
 
02:52:01.950 --> 02:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
presidential one which is I mean maybe
 
02:52:03.710 --> 02:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
next time I'll run for president for a
 
02:52:06.630 --> 02:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
thousand bucks but yeah so there was
 
02:52:10.229 --> 02:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
just people I put my name on the ballot
 
02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
no further uh conversation about why I'm
 
02:52:16.309 --> 02:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
wrong all right um hearing none the
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
clerk will call the role on the on
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2023 2381

02:53:13.920 --> 02:53:15.790 align:start position:0%
fails um good news I have another
amendment

02:53:15.790 --> 02:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
um going to introduce Amendment 2023
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
2382 H which only changes the filing fee
 
02:53:25.389 --> 02:53:25.399 align:start position:0%
for state representative from $2 to $0
 
02:53:27.150 --> 02:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
because as stated earlier there is no
 
02:53:29.190 --> 02:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
way that the town is processing a $2
 
02:53:31.750 --> 02:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
transaction and not losing money on that
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
transaction um so uh can I get represent
 
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:36.600 align:start position:0%

02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%

02:53:57.990 --> 02:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
2382 h no okay I will pass it around I'm
 
02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
sorry I thought I distributed it I guess
 
02:54:03.229 --> 02:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
wrong no 2020 it's for me not
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative venberg um it's 2023 82
 
02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm sending it around right now I
 
02:54:12.349 --> 02:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
apologize I thought I distributed to the
 
02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
committee okay there was a second one
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
surprise there's more coming there's
 
02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
more coming I had 20 I had 25 copies
 
02:54:23.229 --> 02:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
printed there's more
 
02:54:26.590 --> 02:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
coming but you know what it
 
02:54:29.190 --> 02:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
says it changes uh exactly two
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
characters it may be the smallest change
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
of any Amendment it changes two
 
02:54:38.910 --> 02:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.309 --> 02:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
RSA all right does everybody now have a
 
02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
copy of this massive massively complex
 
02:54:46.670 --> 02:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment one more I tell you they can
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
can it's it's okay send it down that's
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine they have
 
02:54:58.870 --> 02:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
mine good yes yeah this might be my
 
02:55:01.469 --> 02:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
crowning achievement if it if it becomes
 
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
adopted um okay so a as stated the only
 
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
thing this does is remove is take the
 
02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
filing fee from 0 uh from $2 to $0
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
because the towns cannot process a $2
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
transaction um issue a receipt put it in
 
02:55:17.190 --> 02:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
give it to the treasurer have the
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
treasurer account for it um they can't
 
02:55:22.790 --> 02:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
do it uh I also have personal reasons of
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh at one point the city of Manchester
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
could not make change for me um and I
 
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
actually said can you take my 20 and
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
they said no you have to have $2 we
 
02:55:34.269 --> 02:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
can't make change for you um so if you
 
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't think somebody's been turned away
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
because they had too much money it's a
 
02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's a thing um so let's just get rid of
 
02:55:44.229 --> 02:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
it because $2 doesn't buy you a Coke so
 
02:55:45.630 --> 02:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
that's my pitch let's get rid of it
 
02:55:47.469 --> 02:55:47.479 align:start position:0%
because $2 doesn't buy you a
 
02:55:50.710 --> 02:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
coke uh discussion on the amendment repr
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
wasent of bone oh
 
02:55:57.070 --> 02:55:57.080 align:start position:0%

02:56:00.429 --> 02:56:00.439 align:start position:0%

reported out as ought to pass as amended
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
on 16 to4 I assume this well this can't
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
go on cuz it counters too many negatives
 
02:58:52.510 --> 02:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lane who will be who
 
02:58:53.870 --> 02:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
unless you want to not object to a
 
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
consent calendar I'm I'm happy to not
 
02:58:59.790 --> 02:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
object to it but okay see I look forward
 
02:59:01.469 --> 02:59:01.479 align:start position:0%
to you report about why towns should do
 
02:59:04.349 --> 02:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
the $2 uh and I will uh I will stand up
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
for the towns and tell them they don't
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
have to take the $2 and we can have a
 
02:59:08.590 --> 02:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
good laugh on it um and I look forward
 
02:59:10.590 --> 02:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
to the vigorous debate on the floor of
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
the house um with that I will close the
 
02:59:16.990 --> 02:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
02:59:20.229 --> 02:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
116 um scratch it off my list so there
 
02:59:23.229 --> 02:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
will be yeah there will be a Minority
 
02:59:24.870 --> 02:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
Report because it is not going on the it
 
02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
has to have a Minority Report if it
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't go on the consent calendar and
 
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
you don't want me writing The Minority
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
Report because I I would thoroughly
 
02:59:35.110 --> 02:59:35.120 align:start position:0%

03:00:54.269 --> 03:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
discussion of the Amendments
 
03:00:57.790 --> 03:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um would you like to
 
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
explain the amendment um sure I'll wait
 
03:01:05.870 --> 03:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
till everybody's got a copy um
 
03:01:09.590 --> 03:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh what we have come to agree to is um
 
03:01:12.670 --> 03:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
the portal bill that we passed last year
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
essentially with the
 
03:01:16.349 --> 03:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
changes um that came up in the
 
03:01:19.389 --> 03:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
conference committee um we've taken out
 
03:01:23.550 --> 03:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
theava funding and uh then we've also
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
made it so that um applications um in
 
03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
the election voter new voter
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
applications in the portal shall not
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
allow verification of identity age or
 
03:01:39.750 --> 03:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
domicile by affidavit under
 
03:01:42.269 --> 03:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
65412 and that's because they can still
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
go into the affidavit
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
um in person with the clerk or on the
 
03:01:49.349 --> 03:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
same day but not there's no way to get a
 
03:01:52.590 --> 03:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
sworn affidavit um and through a portal
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to take the sworn
 
03:01:56.590 --> 03:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit we are allowing however the
 
03:01:58.950 --> 03:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
verification of the citizenship by a
 
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
sworn because most the documentation for
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
citizenship is expensive it's very takes
 
03:02:08.190 --> 03:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
a very long time to get and virtually no
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
state that we're aware of that has a
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
portal requires that and so we will
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
allow verification under a sworn
 
03:02:19.469 --> 03:02:19.479 align:start position:0%
statement under perjury so um and that's
 
03:02:21.790 --> 03:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
it I'll be happy to take questions
 
03:02:23.630 --> 03:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
before we do that I'll give you my my
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
opening salvable on this I want to thank
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
the ranking member uh for accommodating
 
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
our concerns um I did look into the um
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
sworn statement about citizenship it
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
does appear to be a federal requirement
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so unless we were to bifurcate our um
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
ballots and our lists um it can't not
 
03:02:48.710 --> 03:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's double negative um it has to take a
 
03:02:51.750 --> 03:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
sworn statement um in order for us to be
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
in compliance that's what we currently
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
do we currently take a sworn statement
 
03:02:59.309 --> 03:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
um for citizenship only um and then
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
everything else is handled by affidavit
 
03:03:03.710 --> 03:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
so I do appreciate the ranking member uh
 
03:03:06.389 --> 03:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
leave bringing in the affidavits for age
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
identity and doile um I have I had
 
03:03:13.309 --> 03:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
assuming we don't adopt this amendment
 
03:03:13.319 --> 03:03:14.469 align:start position:0%
assuming we don't adopt this amendment
um

03:03:14.469 --> 03:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:17.550 --> 03:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
what I believe are very legitimate
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about taking a quote unquote
 
03:03:24.190 --> 03:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
sorn statement over the Internet with no
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
ID um there's software out there that is
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
free to use such as Microsoft power
 
03:03:32.910 --> 03:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
automate where somebody could submit
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
probably anywhere from you know anywhere
 
03:03:39.550 --> 03:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
from 15 to 20 voter registrations a
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
minute um if there was an affidavit like
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
system for identification age and
 
03:03:48.070 --> 03:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
domicile um
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
these this committee knows my feelings
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
on affidavits in general um at least
 
03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
when they're in person there's somebody
 
03:03:57.150 --> 03:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
standing in front of you um when it goes
 
03:03:58.990 --> 03:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
behind a computer screen and there's no
 
03:04:00.910 --> 03:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
one there period there's nothing and
 
03:04:03.190 --> 03:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's just click a button I am who I say
 
03:04:06.150 --> 03:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
I am I swear it I swear it that is I
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%

opponent shall not allow verification of
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
identity age or doile you can't really
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
do a I mean well it it's two two applies
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
to they're different sections so one and
 
03:05:15.710 --> 03:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
two are linked and two defines what you
 
03:05:18.830 --> 03:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
can do in section A of
 
03:05:21.870 --> 03:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
one this this is the way that OSS
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that I drafted I had drafted
 
03:05:26.309 --> 03:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
it somewhat differently um at the
 
03:05:28.190 --> 03:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
beginning and this is the way they
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
suggested drafting it um because a got
 
03:05:35.790 --> 03:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
very complicated the way that I wrote it
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%

03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
03:21:28.510 --> 03:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
115 uh we are on discussion of the
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
amendment right okay this
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
amendment changes the primary date until
 
03:21:38.389 --> 03:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
the 3 Tuesday in
 
03:21:42.229 --> 03:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
August which is the only change that
 
03:21:47.070 --> 03:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
could be affected for the 2024
 
03:21:49.830 --> 03:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
election okay everything else stays the
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
same with this with this amendment the
 
03:21:57.910 --> 03:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
June date cannot be done on the 2024
 
03:22:00.349 --> 03:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
election because that would move the
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
filing for example to a I mean to March
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
and the bill probably won't even be
 
03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
passed by then so and and this and thing
 
03:22:13.189 --> 03:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
but the the secretary of state has
 
03:22:15.070 --> 03:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
testified when we first brought this up
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
they would like the in August we have a
 
03:22:21.189 --> 03:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
problem with the 45 day federal law
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
thing with the existing schedule in
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
September and and that could be a
 
03:22:29.710 --> 03:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
problem if we have to have a
 
03:22:34.030 --> 03:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
recount uh also affidavit voting also
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
military voting it gives them another
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks three weeks to to get
 
03:22:42.990 --> 03:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
their balance in so with that I'm going
 
03:22:45.590 --> 03:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
the end because it's the my main point
 
03:22:48.309 --> 03:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
of doing this is the only change that
 
03:22:53.750 --> 03:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
can be done for the 2024 election so
 
03:22:56.670 --> 03:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
that further discussion on the
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes representative P
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
O'Brian thank you uh this would make
 
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
this uh primary fall on my birthday some
 
03:23:09.269 --> 03:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
years one year some people may think
 
03:23:11.469 --> 03:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing to be at the polls
 
03:23:13.710 --> 03:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
on their birthday or a bad thing maybe
 
03:23:15.670 --> 03:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's a bad thing I I'm fine with it
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
either way um I don't really
 
03:23:18.560 --> 03:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
either way um I don't really
care

03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:23:25.590 --> 03:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
but August is a good yes bring me a cake
 
03:23:28.910 --> 03:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
August is um a good time for the primary
 
03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
I think for college students that are
 
03:23:35.349 --> 03:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
getting prepared to go to college they
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
can um be sure that they vote before
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
they get there and they don't have to
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
worry about it so we hear a lot of about
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
college students and their interest in
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
voting and they can either Vote or sign
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
up prior to this a little earlier and
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
get the um absentee ballot sent to them
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
if they happen to be um out of state but
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
but it's not as likely that they'll be
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
out of state so I think this is good for
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
the uh college students further
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
03:24:08.189 --> 03:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Bay I just like
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
to take some levity uh my daughter goes
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
to School in Hawaii she leaves home as
 
03:24:15.790 --> 03:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
early as
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
July sounds like June would work great
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
for her
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
um uh further discussion on the
 
03:24:25.469 --> 03:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
amendment um I will be opposing this
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment um two reasons the first of
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
which is as you guys know I'm I'm very
 
03:24:33.550 --> 03:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
outcome oriented and um our friend in
 
03:24:35.389 --> 03:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
the corner office has already vetoed
 
03:24:37.070 --> 03:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
August has already said he'll veto
 
03:24:39.469 --> 03:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
August again um so I don't see any point
 
03:24:42.150 --> 03:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
of spinning my way wheels in the mud um
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
number two I actually don't I have voted
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
for August in the past um before our
 
03:24:49.349 --> 03:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
friend in the corner office gave us his
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
opinion um and I'm not a huge fan of
 
03:24:55.630 --> 03:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
August um parents are still out of town
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
for the most part and as a new dad
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's I'm a little more sensitive to
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
that now than I used to be but now I
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
kind of really get it um especially when
 
03:25:04.750 --> 03:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
you need that vacation um I I am a I've
 
03:25:06.030 --> 03:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
said it before I said it again I'm a
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
June man I'm going to stay a June man um
 
03:25:10.630 --> 03:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
and it's okay that we can uh we can
 
03:25:13.630 --> 03:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree but I do think um
 
03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
June kind of hits everything which is uh
 
03:25:16.710 --> 03:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know there's nothing going on in
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
June which is why it's actually a great
 
03:25:19.389 --> 03:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
time to conduct a primary because
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing going on um versus
 
03:25:24.750 --> 03:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
August parents are still out of town and
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
um I know I just feel like I'm uh I'm
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm going to bring it home I ran
 
03:25:30.910 --> 03:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
as the parents candidate and I'm gonna
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stick up for parents and
 
03:25:34.670 --> 03:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
let him vote in June instead of
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
August representative bone you can tell
 
03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
me why I'm wrong thank you there's a lot
 
03:25:41.950 --> 03:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
going on in June the school graduation
 
03:25:44.990 --> 03:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
all all through the month uh and that
 
03:25:47.150 --> 03:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's a big issue parents are getting
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
the kids ready to go to Camp so there a
 
03:25:52.630 --> 03:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
lot going on in June more than and my
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
main point too for the August this time
 
03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
around is if you do june that can't be
 
03:26:00.670 --> 03:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
effective until 20
 
03:26:04.229 --> 03:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
26 uh because the filing would have to
 
03:26:07.710 --> 03:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
be like in in March this way leaves
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
everything everything the same yeah
 
03:26:13.469 --> 03:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
there still while in June you have you
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
know three weeks less of campaigning
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
which is good and it and we don't have
 
03:26:22.510 --> 03:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
in June for example can you I go to the
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
gym a lot of times during the week and
 
03:26:26.830 --> 03:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
you got all these TV screens in front of
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
me in front of you and it's bad enough
 
03:26:33.550 --> 03:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
from September to June I mean SE to
 
03:26:37.710 --> 03:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
November watching all the political
 
03:26:41.670 --> 03:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
ads uh on all the screens and imagine
 
03:26:44.750 --> 03:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
doing that from June until November
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
watching all the political ads uh which
 
03:26:51.189 --> 03:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
hurts local local ads because I remember
 
03:26:53.790 --> 03:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
people complaining they can't put their
 
03:26:56.269 --> 03:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
ads on TV because of all the political
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
ads and it's only a set time for ads
 
03:27:01.990 --> 03:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
that TV stations can do because they
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
have to show their shows so anyway
 
03:27:06.990 --> 03:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm I've been against youing
 
03:27:09.189 --> 03:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning thank you
 
03:27:09.199 --> 03:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning thank you
representative

03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:27:13.710 --> 03:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you I would like to agree
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
with representative B that there is a
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
lot going on in June for instance we'll
 
03:27:22.189 --> 03:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
still be in session so we will be both
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
campaigning during session and we will
 
03:27:29.110 --> 03:27:29.120 align:start position:0%

adopt two amendments if they compete is
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%

two
 
03:29:35.950 --> 03:29:35.960 align:start position:0%

correct the SEC uh that's a great
 
03:29:39.510 --> 03:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
question does anybody know it looks like
 
03:29:40.590 --> 03:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
yes it looks like the second would be
 
03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:41.950 align:start position:0%
yes it looks like the second would be
prevailing

03:29:41.950 --> 03:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
prevailing
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%

2370 so not
 
03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
2270 which we just looked at
 
03:29:55.189 --> 03:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
2370 however this get confusing is there
 
03:29:55.199 --> 03:29:56.469 align:start position:0%
2370 however this get confusing is there
a

03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:30:08.510 --> 03:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hamlet it is once again this is not
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to be the day that they use as the
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
example for how committee work is
 
03:30:14.800 --> 03:30:17.469 align:start position:0%
example for how committee work is
normally

03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
handled this is a good day of weird
 
03:30:21.630 --> 03:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
things happening recessing coming in and
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
last chary yes it would be a June any
 
03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
more of
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:40.040 --> 03:31:32.269 align:start position:0%
 
didn't

03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:33.870 --> 03:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh we've got to move in second to
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment 223
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
2378 represent Howard you moved this
 
03:31:40.150 --> 03:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
amendment correct that's correct okay
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to to your
 
03:31:44.269 --> 03:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
motion sure uh so thank you Mr chairman
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you fellow committee members
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment does change the
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
original back Bill back to a June
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
primary uh to be clear uh but in
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
addition it would also add the ability
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the State uh to hold its primaries
 
03:32:06.070 --> 03:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
as a rank Choice eligible uh system if
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
the party wants to opt in uh this would
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
only be for the races of governor and
 
03:32:13.150 --> 03:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Congressional offices so that'd
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.950 --> 03:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
Senate this uh is a bill that I think
 
03:32:24.630 --> 03:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
works for both sides uh of of the aisle
 
03:32:27.309 --> 03:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
uh because a it gets rank Choice voting
 
03:32:29.150 --> 03:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
which is something that there are
 
03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
factions on both sides that do agree
 
03:32:33.870 --> 03:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
with it as well as uh it gets a June
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
primary which I do agree there are some
 
03:32:38.670 --> 03:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
advantages of making a uh Stronger
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
cohesive uh party when uh you're running
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
at a top ticket level like governor and
 
03:32:47.870 --> 03:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
Congressional races so it makes a lot of
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
sense to uh to allow for that party
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
unity and have a more in-depth uh
 
03:32:57.870 --> 03:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
process uh as for how this process uh
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
would affect the general population I
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
think that it would be a good test to
 
03:33:09.189 --> 03:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
see whether or not rank Choice voting
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
could be adopted further or if we should
 
03:33:17.070 --> 03:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that's correct sorry uh but it
 
03:33:20.309 --> 03:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
would allow for uh the ability to test
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
out rank Choice voting in a smaller
 
03:33:25.389 --> 03:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
setting that would not necessarily have
 
03:33:28.710 --> 03:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
the implications that uh would allow for
 
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
longer uh election run times if we had
 
03:33:35.150 --> 03:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
lower ballot races uh available so this
 
03:33:37.830 --> 03:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
is kind of a good happy medium uh I
 
03:33:39.550 --> 03:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
think as a starting point for rank
 
03:33:44.349 --> 03:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
Choice voting uh and yeah thank you
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative haml
 
03:33:49.389 --> 03:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I do have some
 
03:33:53.790 --> 03:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
comments um so the basic premise is that
 
03:33:55.950 --> 03:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
a candidate in a multi-candidate
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
race must win over 50% of the total
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
votes in their
 
03:34:04.110 --> 03:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
race okay so it assures that no
 
03:34:05.790 --> 03:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
candidate can win with a small
 
03:34:08.670 --> 03:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of the votes it is fully
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional and better represents the
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
will of the voters than the first pass
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
the post system that we use
 
03:34:17.830 --> 03:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
now um rank Choice voting is also
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
quicker and cheaper than runoff
 
03:34:22.269 --> 03:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
elections and has proven to result in
 
03:34:24.030 --> 03:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
better voter
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
turnout um a party nominee who wins with
 
03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
a higher percentage of the primary votes
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
will be a stronger general election
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
candidate for the party than a Nomine
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
who only received a low percentage of
 
03:34:40.269 --> 03:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
the votes rank Choice voting is actually
 
03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
PR Liberty because it gives voters more
 
03:34:45.670 --> 03:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
choices in the candidates they vote for
 
03:34:47.469 --> 03:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
and I would like to point out two things
 
03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
at the very on page six of the
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
amendment uh number 19 effective date
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
the effective date for the rank Choice
 
03:35:02.429 --> 03:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
voting portion of this amendment or of
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment is January 1st
 
03:35:11.070 --> 03:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
20126 the effective date of of um you
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
know changing changing the primary to
 
03:35:16.469 --> 03:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
June would be 60 days after we
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
passed the the
 
03:35:18.920 --> 03:35:20.510 align:start position:0%
passed the the
bill

03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
than okay uh further discussion
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative bone yes thank you Mr
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
chair we just passed an amendment 15 to
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
five to change the
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
date to August now we have another
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to change the date back to
 
03:35:40.000 --> 03:35:42.110 align:start position:0%
amendment to change the date back to
June

03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
June
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
um I think probably this amendment that
 
03:35:47.469 --> 03:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
we have would leave what we had and not
 
03:35:50.590 --> 03:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
change the date back so I have a problem
 
03:35:54.750 --> 03:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
with is this correct we you know we have
 
03:35:56.550 --> 03:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
how many amendments are we going to have
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
to keep changing the date back and forth
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
we changed the date to August now we're
 
03:36:05.070 --> 03:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
trying to change it back to June so can
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
I make another amendment to change it
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
back to August I mean this is getting
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
we should is that is that a question is
 
03:36:15.429 --> 03:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
that a question of the chair or just a
 
03:36:16.830 --> 03:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
rhetorical rical question yes
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative katab I'm not sure that
 
03:36:22.750 --> 03:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
um per current statue the effective date
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh on this statue would be legal it
 
03:36:28.990 --> 03:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
would be in um conflict with RSA 14
 
03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:30.630 align:start position:0%
would be in um conflict with RSA 14
colon

03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
colon
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
9-a um part 2 G where it says that it
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
gives a list of the requirements for
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
effective dates and then you get down to
 
03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
the part where all other laws shall take
 
03:36:44.830 --> 03:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage um the only
 
03:36:47.550 --> 03:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
law where you can do January 1st
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
following passage is affecting judicial
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure or establishing
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
or eliminating criminal prohibition
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
civil causes of actions or remedies or
 
03:36:59.670 --> 03:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
limitations of actions um so I just I
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think this would be in
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
conflict with our our statute for the
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
effective date so there's a principle in
 
03:37:06.800 --> 03:37:08.670 align:start position:0%
effective date so there's a principle in
uh

03:37:08.670 --> 03:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
legislative process uh one legislator
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
can one legislature cannot bind the
 
03:37:17.150 --> 03:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
hands of a future legislature so the
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
fact that the bill explicitly States the
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
dates would override because new laws
 
03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
override old laws right so it's kind of
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
irrelevant that it's in Conflict it very
 
03:37:30.550 --> 03:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
well may be but the the new the fact
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
that this bill states that date that
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be held hostage by an older
 
03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:36.349 align:start position:0%
cannot be held hostage by an older
legisl

03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
legisl
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
legislator legislative body which is
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
obviously not so that that point I
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
believe would be moot because it
 
03:37:43.630 --> 03:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
explicitly says it now if it didn't say
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
it I think you would have a point but it
 
03:37:48.670 --> 03:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
does actually explicitly say it um that
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
being said I'm going to support this um
 
03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
I am not a fan of rank Choice voting
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
I've given many many speeches about why
 
03:37:55.389 --> 03:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
I don't like rank Choice voting but I
 
03:37:56.670 --> 03:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
have also said another thing which is
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'll do darn or anything to get to June
 
03:38:02.189 --> 03:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
um so um I will do darn or anything to
 
03:38:03.630 --> 03:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
get to June and I appreciate
 
03:38:04.990 --> 03:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
representative ham working with me on
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
that so you're going to see something
 
03:38:08.429 --> 03:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
you'll probably never see me do again uh
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
which is vote for rank Choice voting
 
03:38:12.510 --> 03:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
because I love me some June um and I
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
hope others will join me who also may
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
like June um and I think this was a good
 
03:38:19.469 --> 03:38:19.479 align:start position:0%
kind of Common Ground you also can't do
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting without moving the
 
03:38:22.510 --> 03:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
primary date probably realistically to
 
03:38:24.590 --> 03:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
June um because you're not going to get
 
03:38:27.309 --> 03:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
those results um very quickly and that's
 
03:38:30.309 --> 03:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's a oh representative uh the clerk
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
is here to tell me what I've done
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
entirely wrong is he's Mr clerk do you
 
03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:35.429 align:start position:0%
entirely wrong is he's Mr clerk do you
want

03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
want
 
03:38:38.229 --> 03:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
to um should I recess and Co chat all
 
03:38:39.389 --> 03:38:39.399 align:start position:0%
right let me go and figure out what I've
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:45:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:24.189 --> 03:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back into order I'm
 
03:45:25.830 --> 03:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
going to reopen the executive session
 
03:45:28.149 --> 03:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the house election law committee um
 
03:45:33.269 --> 03:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
after consultation with um the clerk who
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
called the speaker the speaker has
 
03:45:39.229 --> 03:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
ruled Amendment 2023 2370 H is non-
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
gerain to the underlying bill um I do
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
just for what it's worth um I I I
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
disagree but that's not my decision um
 
03:45:49.790 --> 03:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
it is ultimately the speaker's decision
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
so um we are going to have to pull the
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment back uh because it is non
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
gerain to the underlying bill um so we
 
03:45:59.149 --> 03:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
are back on the ought to pass Amendment
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended um with
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment Ralph what I representative M
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me what's your Amendment 227 2270
 
03:46:11.550 --> 03:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
H 2270 h uh so we are on to discussion
 
03:46:14.750 --> 03:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
on the bill as amended by
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill okay uh yes no maybe so look like
 
03:46:28.870 --> 03:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
you want to no okay um uh I I'll be
 
03:46:30.630 --> 03:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
voting against this uh there's no point
 
03:46:32.189 --> 03:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
in sending over an August bill that's
 
03:46:33.790 --> 03:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
going to get vetoed um I do believe
 
03:46:35.269 --> 03:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
there will be legislation coming forward
 
03:46:37.469 --> 03:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
from our friends across the wall uh to
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
get something done on this matter that
 
03:46:41.229 --> 03:46:41.239 align:start position:0%
may actually be called to into law but I
 
03:46:42.510 --> 03:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
don't as I said earlier I don't believe
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
in spinning my wheels in the mud um and
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
I definitely don't want to create more
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
work for us on veto day so with that the
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%

03:47:55.229 --> 03:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
in election law I swear to God uh so
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
with that um that'll be passed out as
 
03:47:58.870 --> 03:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended representative
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
bone you will be responsible for the
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
committee report um who's going to do
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
the minority yep I'm going to figure
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
that out um I think you should write it
 
03:48:12.030 --> 03:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
I really I I want to write the committee
 
03:48:13.550 --> 03:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment The Minority Report but
 
03:48:15.229 --> 03:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
it's I'm the chairman and it's usually
 
03:48:16.750 --> 03:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to write The Minority
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
Report when you are the chair of the
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
committee I I can I can write it um I'm
 
03:48:24.149 --> 03:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
just it's inappropriate to write it um
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
so I need to find someone else who can
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
write it um representative Osborne would
 
03:48:30.269 --> 03:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
you mind writing The Minority Report for
 
03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
us I I am I am sure you
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
would um okay uh and with that we only
 
03:48:40.269 --> 03:48:40.279 align:start position:0%
have one other bill
 
03:48:41.630 --> 03:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close executive session on

have a motion okay an itl so um oh we
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
have an we an itl an itl motion was made
 
03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
that is correct we are we are on an itl
 
03:49:47.950 --> 03:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
motion I forgot we'd already taken this
 
03:49:50.110 --> 03:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
up we haven't voted yet and there's no
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
amendments because it's an ital motion
 
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so what I think we need to do um so
 
03:49:58.030 --> 03:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
we can do one of two things we can
 
03:49:59.910 --> 03:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion of itl which is
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
probably what I would recommend for the
 
03:50:03.670 --> 03:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee so that we can honor each
 
03:50:06.670 --> 03:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
other's amendments um because that's
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good way to work together right
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
um and then we can come back to an itl
 
03:50:11.309 --> 03:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
motion should it be necessary so I
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
believe representative qu I believe you
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
made the itl motion correct would you be
 
03:50:16.830 --> 03:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
willing to withdraw your itl motion I'm
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
sure what the implications of that uh
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
the implications of that are it allows
 
03:50:22.349 --> 03:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
us to take up representative Hamlet's
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment um because if we're on an itl
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
motion we can't take up an amendment and
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
so if I withdraw what happens next uh
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
well I would allow representative Hamlet
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
to make her ought to pass motion and
 
03:50:34.269 --> 03:50:34.279 align:start position:0%
then bring forward her Amendment um and
 
03:50:35.630 --> 03:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
then we can vote her Amendment up or
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
down and then it'll be on an aop pass as
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
amended or not um and if that fails then
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
it would go back to an itl motion which
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
would be where I imagine it would end
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
up you do not have to do that we can
 
03:50:49.870 --> 03:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
take the itel motion now if you would
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
like it is I'm not you can't force you
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
to withdraw it of course you can but
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
you're recommending that I withdraw it
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm recommending for you
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
respecting your colleague's work um that
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
we allow her to bring her Amendment
 
03:51:04.189 --> 03:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
forward as a courtesy I will withdraw
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
the motion okay so so we are we have no
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
motion now we are on back on an not to
 
03:51:11.149 --> 03:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
pass motion from represent Hamlet
 
03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes and then there's a
 
03:51:16.110 --> 03:51:16.120 align:start position:0%
second for her motion of oop pass
 
03:51:18.030 --> 03:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative Howard seconds the motion
 
03:51:19.229 --> 03:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet do you have an
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
345 I I do have an amendment but it's
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
been corrected by OS and it should be
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
down here any
 
03:51:31.870 --> 03:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
minute okay
 
03:51:34.349 --> 03:51:34.359 align:start position:0%

03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
chair so um Amendment it's amendment
 
03:57:01.950 --> 03:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
number 2023
 
03:57:04.110 --> 03:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
23978 and representative Howard do you
 
03:57:06.149 --> 03:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
second the adoption of
 
03:57:09.550 --> 03:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes I will H you may speak
 
03:57:13.229 --> 03:57:13.239 align:start position:0%
to your Amendment thank you okay so this
 
03:57:16.189 --> 03:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
is an amendment to House Bill 345 House
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 345 is an enabling bill for rank
 
03:57:21.710 --> 03:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
Choice voting it would allow State
 
03:57:23.389 --> 03:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
political parties to use rank Choice
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
voting for party primaries if they
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
choose to it would also allow cities and
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
towns to use rank Choice voting for
 
03:57:32.830 --> 03:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections if they choose to
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 345 explains the terms
 
03:57:37.830 --> 03:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
and procedures used in rank Choice
 
03:57:40.110 --> 03:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
voting elections
 
03:57:42.429 --> 03:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
however since rank Choice voting is
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
still a New Concept in New Hampshire I
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
am introducing this amendment to limit
 
03:57:51.070 --> 03:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting to just Municipal
 
03:57:53.229 --> 03:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
elections although rank Choice voting
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be extremely useful in state party
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
primaries political parties would not be
 
03:58:00.269 --> 03:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to use rank Choice voting unless
 
03:58:03.229 --> 03:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
approved by another bill or if we pass
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 345 without this
 
03:58:08.590 --> 03:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh use of rank Choice voting
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
is expanding all over this country uh it
 
03:58:14.070 --> 03:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
is a voting system that expands the
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
ability for voters to have their voices
 
03:58:19.790 --> 03:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
heard it is easy to use and easy to
 
03:58:23.349 --> 03:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
count some municipalities effectively
 
03:58:26.110 --> 03:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
have runoff elections in their Municipal
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
elections the use of rank Choice voting
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
could save them time and money with
 
03:58:31.600 --> 03:58:32.469 align:start position:0%
could save them time and money with
better

03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:58:35.469 --> 03:58:35.479 align:start position:0%
turnout and because we are a Dylan rule
 
03:58:37.950 --> 03:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
state they cannot use rank Choice voting
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
unless we pass House Bill 345 in order
 
03:58:41.800 --> 03:58:42.630 align:start position:0%
unless we pass House Bill 345 in order
to

03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:58:45.950 --> 03:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities to use rank choice
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
or to choose rank Choice voting for
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
themselves some municipalities will opt
 
03:58:53.790 --> 03:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
in some won't it should be up to them
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
and their voters um training will be
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
available to any cities and towns and
 
03:59:03.429 --> 03:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
citizens that seek help with
 
03:59:05.710 --> 03:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
implementation if you believe that rank
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
Choice voting is fully constitutional
 
03:59:11.149 --> 03:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh as many courts have found then vote
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
to let cities and towns try it if you
 
03:59:15.910 --> 03:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
believe that rank Choice voting
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
eliminates vote splitting and the
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
spoiler effect then vote to let cities
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
and towns try it if you believe that
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
rank Choice voting is fairer then first
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
pass the post and better represents the
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
will of the voters then vote to let
 
03:59:34.510 --> 03:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
cities and towns try it rank Choice
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
voting is a pro-liberty voting
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.550 align:start position:0%
voting is a pro-liberty voting
system

03:59:39.550 --> 03:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
I can explain further if you have any
 
03:59:44.790 --> 03:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
questions uh further statements or
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee on
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2023
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
239 please limit your conversations to
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment yes res of Howard thank
 
03:59:55.950 --> 03:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and fellow committee
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
members uh the amendment to HB 345
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
really does allow municipalities to
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
lower their costs significantly I think
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the Manchester Mayoral race is a
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
very good example of what we have now
 
04:00:12.149 --> 04:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
versus what it could potentially be uh
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
we had four candidates running uh in the
 
04:00:16.590 --> 04:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester race that have already gone
 
04:00:19.950 --> 04:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
through that uh primary stage and we're
 
04:00:22.149 --> 04:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
now in their general election that's
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
basically a runoff we could instead
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
limit that to one election day rather
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
than two which is a huge uh way to save
 
04:00:33.790 --> 04:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
money uh and on top of that it's
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
something where we are not necessarily
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
forcing the towns and municipalities to
 
04:00:40.590 --> 04:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
up take this but just giving them
 
04:00:43.229 --> 04:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities to choose the
 
04:00:46.149 --> 04:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
best way forward for themselves thank
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
you further comments on the amendment
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative weie uh just a question
 
04:00:54.990 --> 04:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
does this um provide
 
04:00:55.000 --> 04:00:56.630 align:start position:0%
does this um provide
for

04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:01:01.950 --> 04:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
the publication or the the uh revelation
 
04:01:04.830 --> 04:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes of each
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh kind of rank Choice runoff
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
in other words do you do you are you
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to understand the progression
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
through the voting of the algorithm are
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
to rephrase your question are you asking
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
is there a public information campaign
 
04:01:22.990 --> 04:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
attached to this no no that was not the
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
question the question has to do with the
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
the results of you know theoretically
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
the rank Choice voting goes through a
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
series of runoffs bya the rank Choice
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
algorithm and then so the question is is
 
04:01:43.910 --> 04:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
what are the results of each uh tier in
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
the in the in the algorithm is that made
 
04:01:49.590 --> 04:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
known so that you can see okay this
 
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get first P the post or whatever
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
it is and and then you know does it
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
account for you know attrition due to
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
people not completing all the rankings
 
04:02:04.750 --> 04:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
for the number of runoffs that occur etc
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
etc so I I just want to understand if
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
people have transparency to what they're
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
actually doing because you know it
 
04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
sounds great but I but if there's not
 
04:02:14.479 --> 04:02:15.309 align:start position:0%
sounds great but I but if there's not
any

04:02:15.309 --> 04:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:02:17.429 --> 04:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
transparency as to what actually
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
happened during the voting and the
 
04:02:22.149 --> 04:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
algorithm that rank Choice voting you
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
know enabled the final outcome then then
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's I object to this representative
 
04:02:28.750 --> 04:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hamlet would you like to answer the
 
04:02:31.630 --> 04:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair yes it's
 
04:02:31.640 --> 04:02:32.750 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair yes it's
fully

04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
fully
 
04:02:32.760 --> 04:02:35.469 align:start position:0%
fully
transparent

04:02:35.469 --> 04:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
04:02:39.309 --> 04:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
um the results are fully documented in
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
each round of the voting in an easy to
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
understand fashion and everything is
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
replicable so yes it's done openly and
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's completely transparent and it's
 
04:02:55.630 --> 04:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
replicable further questions comments on
 
04:02:55.640 --> 04:02:56.590 align:start position:0%
replicable further questions comments on
the

04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
qu thank you Mr chairman it'll be no
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
surprised that since I oppose
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
the original bill that I also oppose
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment given its slight change
 
04:03:14.750 --> 04:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
from the original bill I do respect the
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh I I I appreciate the interest in
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
improving things on the part of the the
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
people working on this but I just don't
 
04:03:23.950 --> 04:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
agree it'll be an improvement I think
 
04:03:25.229 --> 04:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
it'll be a
 
04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
mistake and my concerns revolve
 
04:03:31.229 --> 04:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
explicitly around questions of
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
04:03:36.349 --> 04:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
impartiality uh I I approached this
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
whole question from the standpoint of
 
04:03:41.149 --> 04:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the the purpose of our election
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
system that ultimate purpose I think we
 
04:03:46.750 --> 04:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
all agree that the legitimacy of our
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
entire system of governments local state
 
04:03:53.149 --> 04:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
federal depends upon the consent of the
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
government and the purpose of Elections
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
is to ensure we have the consent of the
 
04:04:01.630 --> 04:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
government and as I see it in order to
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
fulfill that purpose our election system
 
04:04:07.790 --> 04:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
has to perform an accurate assessment of
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
public sentiment on the the questions
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and candidates it issue and it has to do
 
04:04:17.070 --> 04:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
so in such a way that we preserve the
 
04:04:20.389 --> 04:04:20.399 align:start position:0%
trust and faith of the
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
public that the outcomes of these these
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
elections are are
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
valid and my focus is on that latter
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
part preserving the trust of the public
 
04:04:32.199 --> 04:04:33.750 align:start position:0%
part preserving the trust of the public
it's

04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:04:37.950 --> 04:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
essential uh and to me preserving the
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
Trust of the public requires that our
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
election processes be
 
04:04:46.110 --> 04:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
transparent that they be
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
impartial and also that they produce an
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
unambiguous uh victure in a timely
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
fashion and as I said a moment ago my
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
emphas my focus here is
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
on transparency and impartiality
 
04:05:00.680 --> 04:05:02.070 align:start position:0%
on transparency and impartiality
regarding

04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:05:06.149 --> 04:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
transparency our current system of uh PL
 
04:05:10.349 --> 04:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
plurality wins the the issue wins the
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
election uh by by transparency I mean
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the public can readily understand
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
the processes they don't even have to
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
study them that would be ideal and in
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
this case with pluralities we have that
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
circumstance the pl plurality approach
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
to determining a winner can be reduced
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
to a three-word algorithm most votes
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
wins what's proposed in this bill and
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're discussing
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
now it's four pages of explanation
 
04:05:43.710 --> 04:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
required in the bill to to educate
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
people on how it
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
works uh page and a half of that like 52
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
lines or I think I counted them 17
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
definitions which people would need to
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
understand to fully understand the
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
results as calculated by this
 
04:05:59.760 --> 04:06:02.189 align:start position:0%
results as calculated by this
method

04:06:02.189 --> 04:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
method
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I think that is way too high a
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
burden I think that is a a significant
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
DEC increase in
 
04:06:11.429 --> 04:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
transparency it's particularly when
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
people on their own wish to check for
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
themselves the result under our present
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
system all you need to do is look at the
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
vote totals there's no math required to
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
Simply compare the vote totals for the
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
different issues or candidates and you
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
know the result you've validated it that
 
04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
is very
 
04:06:33.670 --> 04:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
transparent in my view this change
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed would be a very
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
serious decrease in transparency and
 
04:06:41.790 --> 04:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
such a decrease in transparency that to
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
me it is a fatal defect in the
 
04:06:47.309 --> 04:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
approach another aspect I'm concerned
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
with has to do with
 
04:06:51.469 --> 04:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
impartiality the
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
proponents uh I've read the literature
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
from the proponents of this approach and
 
04:06:56.560 --> 04:06:57.670 align:start position:0%
from the proponents of this approach and
they

04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly present as a benefit that the
 
04:07:04.030 --> 04:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
system will then
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
reward candidates who have a broader
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
appeal to the electorate that's how they
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's how they phrase I'm paraphrasing
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
but that's the gist of
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
it uh it's not up to the election system
 
04:07:18.429 --> 04:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
to reward
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
candidates for any basis whatsoever
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's up to the
 
04:07:25.710 --> 04:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
voters the election system needs to be
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
strictly impartial with respect to
 
04:07:32.109 --> 04:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
candidates another example of uh
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
decreased impartiality or lack of
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
impartiality comes to another
 
04:07:42.590 --> 04:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh effect of RCV uh which is s as a
 
04:07:44.710 --> 04:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
benefit which is it reduces the influ
 
04:07:47.950 --> 04:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
influence of uh what the proponents in
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
the literature I've read it was handed
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
out to us at previous election law
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee meetings they refer to a
 
04:07:53.760 --> 04:07:54.830 align:start position:0%
committee meetings they refer to a
spoiler

04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
spoiler
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
candidates uh I didn't see a definition
 
04:07:59.229 --> 04:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
but from the examples given I presume
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
that that means candidates that re
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
receive low vote
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
totals well again it's not up to the
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
election system to reduce the influence
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
of particular candidates on the outcome
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
of an election whatsoever that is
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
strictly a function of the
 
04:08:22.630 --> 04:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
voters uh so I consider that another
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
fatal defect in terms of
 
04:08:28.990 --> 04:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
impartiality uh with respect to this
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
particular bill that has opt in for
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections it's my view that
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
all voters all citizens have the same
 
04:08:40.590 --> 04:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
rights and they all have the same right
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
to transparency and impartiality in
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
their election system if we adopted this
 
04:08:48.030 --> 04:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
I believe that residents of some
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities that chose to adopt it
 
04:08:55.229 --> 04:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
would be subject to a lessened exercise
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
of those rights and for those reasons I
 
04:09:02.030 --> 04:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
do oppose this amendment okay uh further
 
04:09:04.590 --> 04:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
discussion uh and I believe uh just for
 
04:09:06.990 --> 04:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
the sake of uh time I believe everybody
 
04:09:10.710 --> 04:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
we've we've debated um discussed RCV to
 
04:09:12.670 --> 04:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
extent so I'm going to ask members
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
to be brief going forward because I
 
04:09:15.710 --> 04:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
think there are some members who were
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
trying toart representative Howard yes
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
address some of uh representative quay's
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
concerns uh first of all I just wanted
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
to say uh that when it comes to the
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
consent of the governor of the Govern
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
when we are selecting somebody to be a
 
04:09:38.189 --> 04:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
representative that is trying to get a
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
majority of people voting and if you can
 
04:09:42.910 --> 04:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
get a majority of people over 50% in
 
04:09:46.269 --> 04:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
your community to approve you then you
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
are meeting that consent and that's what
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh rank Choice voting helps do because
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
instead of having to lock people into
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
Party politics allows them to vote their
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
conscience and I mean a lot of the time
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
and when we have these Municipal races
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
they're nonpartisan to begin with uh so
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know not necessarily trying
 
04:10:08.670 --> 04:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
to benefit one party or the other it's
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
just trying to allow for the greatest
 
04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
ability to come to a consensus amongst a
 
04:10:17.269 --> 04:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
group of people for instance I know that
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
we mentioned first past the post let's
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
take an election that say has 10
 
04:10:23.550 --> 04:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
candidates to make it easy all of them
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
get about 10% of the vote one candidate
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
gets 11% of the vote and one candidate
 
04:10:30.750 --> 04:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
gets nine the candidate with 11% of the
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
vote would end up winning the
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
election 90% up up nearly 90% of people
 
04:10:38.750 --> 04:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for the for that person and
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to say that that's
 
04:10:41.550 --> 04:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable I don't think that that's
 
04:10:44.030 --> 04:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
consent of the Govern I think that when
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the system that we
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
have right now we're thinking about it
 
04:10:51.030 --> 04:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of it works for me it's
 
04:10:53.070 --> 04:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable but it doesn't always
 
04:10:54.830 --> 04:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily work best for the people and
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
that's what rank Choice voting is
 
04:10:58.990 --> 04:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
seeking to fix because it's not just
 
04:11:00.910 --> 04:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
saying if there are too many candidates
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
then the pool is so diluted that you
 
04:11:05.590 --> 04:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
know whoever you end up voting for could
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
end up winning with a minimal percentage
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
such as
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
11% and that is why rank Choice voting
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
is superior to first pass the post thank
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh I'm the clerk I'm going
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
to end executive session on the
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
amendment and the clerk will call the
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
role I don't believe we're going to move
 
04:11:25.109 --> 04:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
