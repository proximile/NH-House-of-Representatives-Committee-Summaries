an important piece of legislation and
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
first it aligns New Hampshire's
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rules relative to pole
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
attachment rates which uh with statute
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
by directing the department of energy to
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
do adopt formulas for use when resolving
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
disputes between pole attachment owning
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
utilities and entities like Broadband
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
providers and attaching their networks
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
to the polls secondly it it directs the
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
agency to develop an accelerated dispute
 
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
process resolution process as the
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%

transparent predictability and fair pole
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
attachment rates and accelerated dispute
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
resolutions are key elements to good
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure development policy that's
 
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.950 align:start position:0%
infrastructure development policy that's
a

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
mouthful just
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
saying this bill is providing uh
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
predictability transparency and
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
certainty to a process that is critical
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's goal of universal
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
Broadband access the New Hampshire
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
legislature has done great work in
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
recent years adopting policies which
 
00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
speed and encourage Broadband employ uh
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
deployment such as part two of sb88
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
which orders the department of energy to
 
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
adopt FCC OneTouch Make Ready rules uh
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
we should continue that effort by
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
passing 595 as
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%

members thank you uh Senator avard
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
senator representative Harrington has
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
one thank you chairman thank you for
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator uh just
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get this straight cuz reading
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill it talks about the
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
department which I assume is the
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy correct multiple
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
times but when you go to the fiscal note
 
00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
it talks about the Pu so who's doing
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
what where can you just kind of
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
straighten that out for us please I'm
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to try uh yeah I know it is the Pu
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
I think it's uh I'm trying to find out
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
where um they set the rules and then uh
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
I think the Pu executes them I'm trying
 
00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
to just read so just a followup so what
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying is then the the department
 
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
of energy will set the on a non
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding set some rule
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
out and then it'll be up to the Pu to
 
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
enforce the rule I believe so yes sir
 
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.869 align:start position:0%
enforce the rule I believe so yes sir
okay

00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
and does the Pu have any authority over
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
non-utility attachments to polls that
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of I I don't I do not know
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
about that but I know that they're most
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
likely if you look at the fiscal note
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to hire somebody
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
to right I'm just a little trying to see
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
how that works out but I'll just save
 
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
that question we'll have a testimony by
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
the department in just a few minutes so
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
we can get some clarification on that
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
Senator would you say that uh it's
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
basically true that what this rule what
 
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation does is it gives the
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
department as opposed to the commission
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for developing the
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
formula that's used for po attachments
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
is that correct okay thank you further
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator avard
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
chairman hello Senator good morning um
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
so following up on representative
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
Harrington's question yeah uh so the doe
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
would set the rules and the PO pu would
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
enforce this seems the reverse of what
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
normally happens doesn't the Pu usually
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
set rules and the doe enforce I'm just a
 
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.750 align:start position:0%
set rules and the doe enforce I'm just a
pretty

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.670 align:start position:0%

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
have about this legislation good morning
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
to the both of you and welcome good
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
um so I want to address first the
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
question from representative hering
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for represent from
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington about the
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um the bill before you has
 
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
been amended since this fiscal note was
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
developed by the Public Utilities
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
Commission and we understand from them
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
that this would no longer be an accurate
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I don't have an explanation
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
for you as to why they haven't updated
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
the FIS note but we do understand that
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note is no longer accurate
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that the commission would no longer
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
need the resources that it listed in its
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um as was noted some of this
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
work has transferred to the department
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
to um have a stakeholder session and
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
develop a formula for um poll attachment
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
resolving disputes between carriers
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
about the appropriate rate for a poll
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
attachment and uh present those to the
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
commission for them to adopt rules um
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
and it is uh currently typical that the
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
department would set rules under policy
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
and if there were sanctions and
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions to be taken that
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
would be done by the commission so
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a flip it's it's the
 
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a flip it's it's the
current

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
Paradigm um having said all of that the
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill this
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
is work that we can do within um our our
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
current resources um and we're happy to
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
to help res Sol this
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
issue I think there was a question about
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
non-utility attachments to polls and I
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if Mr yes representative
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
Harrington repeat your question about
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
sorry that issue my uh my question was
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
on whether I obviously for the the
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
electric utilities the Pu and doe both
 
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
have some kind of shared authority over
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
that but for communication lines that
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
are not utilities does the do either of
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
those groups have the authority to tell
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
those entities how to operate and with
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
attachments I know the FCC has some
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
Authority but I didn't know that the
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
state did we do have some limited
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
Authority yes but um it's mostly
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
exercised through the poll
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
owners and their agreements follow up so
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
in other words the uh in this case it
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
would be either the I guess the
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
telephone company or the electric
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
company that owns the pole and they
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
would have agreements with the
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
Communication company and that's how the
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
doe and pu would have some limited
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
Authority that's that's how the whole
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
Paradigm is set up uh the Agreements are
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part voluntary between pole
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
owners and
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
attachers okay so this wouldn't change
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
that then uh no
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't really change that
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
Paradigm the formula would be applied
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
when there's a disagreement when um
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
parties can't come to an agreement on
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
what the price for an attachment should
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
be uh and the Pu has to set in uh step
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
into set rates uh they would use the
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
formula to do that rather than a
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
six-part test that they're currently
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
using Okay followup followup I'm just a
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
little concerned
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
because I know the FCC has control over
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
the like the a cable line or an internet
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
line line but I didn't think that the
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
state had the authority and unless we're
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
granting him via this bill to come in
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
and say okay this is what you're going
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
to charge based on this law we we we do
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
have that Authority we you okay you do
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Vice chair Thomas has a
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh for
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
clarification at least for me anyway uh
 
00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
in the early part of the bill it uh
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
talks about uh that they the commission
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
shall use an a poll attachment
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
formula rather than a multi-part test
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
could could you describe the difference
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
other so I don't have the current uh six
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
part consideration for the pole
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
attachment rates in front of me right
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
now but it's more than just a
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
calculation of space on the poll and
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
rate of return and so forth it's it's
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
more than just the calculation of the
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
rate there are other less quantifiable
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
factors in that six-part test and so
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
moving to just a formula based pole
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
attachment rate provides certainty to
 
00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.550 align:start position:0%
attachment rate provides certainty to
pole

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
pole
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
attachers follow up okay so in other
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
words the current system is this
 
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.389 align:start position:0%
words the current system is this
multi-part

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
multi-part
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
test that's correct okay thank
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee has
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
one good morning nice to see you all
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
again again um so it it appears that
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
there's a you know a couple of different
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
um intents for the bill and I'm
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
wondering what the timing uh says around
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
us meeting Our obligation to the folks
 
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
that are looking for this is the 18
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
months a reasonable amount of time to
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
get um to be setting how we're going to
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
move forward and finalizing the formula
 
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
because I think one of the intents here
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
is to create some predictability and
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
also to clarify that everyone who's
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
attached is receiving similar treatment
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
I guess is is that an
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment yes yes that's an
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
accurate summary of of what it would do
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
um we're comfortable with the amount of
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
time that the department would have to
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish what it needs to
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish and in followup followup uh
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
and I I understand that we've got other
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
bills where 18 months is also a year and
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
a half is also the the time frame but I
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm asking is whether there
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
is any sense of urgency or whether there
 
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
is uh a need for any more expedient
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
response to turning around um the rul
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
making whether the delays are actually
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
causing any problems for the people who
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
are current poll
 
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
attaches so I I'm sure you'll hear a
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
testimony from some of the current poll
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
attaches this morning um my
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of as Mr shellock
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
identified earlier the current structure
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
is there are voluntary agreements
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
agreements entered into negotiated
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
between the PO attacher and a pole owner
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
this would be for when those entities
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreed upon solution so
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
I'll let them comment on whether there's
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
any timing issues or sense of urgency
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
for them oh can it follow up okay so is
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that um there may be
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
agreements that the uh poll owners and
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
the Pol attaches can come to outside of
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
this process that can continue to go
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
forward yes and there would not be a
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
delay waiting on this correct that's
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
correct thanks I thought that's what you
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
were saying representative Ms has a
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
you for being here this morning um I
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
have heard conflicting opinions as to
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not um this bill would bring
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
us more in line with the um the approach
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
recommended or preferred by the
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
that certainly um as drafted the
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
department would give deference to the
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
formulas that the FCC has developed for
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
pole attachment
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
rates as I indicated this would be used
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
when parties weren't able to come to a
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
negotiated agreement um but it would
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
bring in those instances the pole
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
attachment rate more in line with the
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
FCC formulas
 
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.149 align:start position:0%
FCC formulas
certainly

00:18:10.149 --> 00:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
followup um and and then also it it it's
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it's unclear to me how New
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's rates pole attachment rates
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
compared to other states I mean I've
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
again I've heard that they're in some
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
they're higher they're lower do you have
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
any sense as to how our rates compared
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I don't have any of that
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
information with me today it's certainly
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
information if you're interested in we
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
could go back and um collect and provide
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
to you if you'd
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
like representative Kaplan has a
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming in this morning
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
um just for a little bit more clarity on
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
the formula it does say that you will
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
give deference to the FCC formula but
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
you may consider other formulas so what
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
what other form you know what type of
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
other form would that be from other
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
state formulas or how would they differ
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
from the FCC thank
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
you so that's that's a little bit of a
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
chicken in the egg question I think
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
until we have a stakeholder session and
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
hear input from the various stakeholders
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
involved in the poll attachment process
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
um I I can't really point to uh another
 
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
um another formula that might be
 
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.590 align:start position:0%
um another formula that might be
considered

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
folks yes I believe some of our electric
 
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
utilities have a formula that they use
 
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
in determining what the pole attachment
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
rate is for pole attachers so that may
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
be a proposal that gets put forward um
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
and considered in conjunction with the
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
rate we can find out more about that
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
testifying representative muns thank you
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just as a kind of another
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
followup to my my question about the
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
rates and how they compare um has there
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
been any analysis done to indicate what
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
you know adopting a a more FCC compliant
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
formula would do
 
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
formula would do
to

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
um um elect rates cable rates um I mean
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
presumably it would change how much the
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
attachers pay which ultimately is going
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
to get passed through to Consumers has
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
any analysis like that been
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
done this is just the very beginning
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
process for this so at this point no um
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
we we haven't looked at what that would
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
be uh this formula would be for use in
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
instances when a poll owner and a poll
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
attacher can't voluntarily agree upon a
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
poll attachment rate so to the extent
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
those Agreements are in place now they
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
go forward to the extent they can
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
negotiate and agree to rate as they've
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
done in the past that would occur this
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
would be used when there's a dispute
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
about what the poll attachment rate
 
00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:24.430 align:start position:0%
about what the poll attachment rate
should

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
be okay seeing no further questions we
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh from the Department for
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
being here now we'll get a perspective
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
from the industry and I'll call on Paul
 
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
Phillips of the New Hampshire telephone
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
Association and I think he'll be joined
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
by Chris Rand of Granit State
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
Communications and they will give us
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
their perspective on this legislation
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
good morning gentlemen thank you good
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%

rules and one in 2017 which amended
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
those rules to um acknowledge and
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate dat the uh FCC poll
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
attachment formula uh we are here uh to

oppose s SP
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
with electric
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
companies um we feel that the FCC
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
formula is already generous to attachers
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
in the case of gr State Communications
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
um the attachers are only paying a few
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
dollars per year to attach to our polls
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um we we understand Broadband has become
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh a very competitive service to
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
provide and we're concerned that this
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill would allow the attachers uh to
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
bring us in front of the FCC in an
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
attempt merely to shift their cost of
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
attaching onto our
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
customers um for NH ta members renting
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
space to attachers is not a lucrative
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
line of business it often costs uh uh
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
more than the revenue that's
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
generated uh and the nhta members see
 
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.470 align:start position:0%
generated uh and the nhta members see
this

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
legislation as a reaction to a contract
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
dispute uh between a single pole owner
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
and a single
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
attacher we don't see any benefit to an
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
expensive and protracted regul at
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
process the agreements that were
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier are private agreements
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
they're voluntarily entered into between
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
two parties uh any contract dispute can
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
be resolved via the terms of that
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
agreement or the existing regulatory
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
processes as they are um and we don't
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
see that it's necessary to uh pull in
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
all the pole owners across the state of
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh when it's a dispute
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
between two parties
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh and that's it thanks Chris uh the
 
00:25:05.389 --> 00:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
nhta companies uh have not had occasion
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
to come to the legislature for quite a
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
few years because in 2012 as you know uh
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature enacted s sp48 which
 
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.789 align:start position:0%
the legislature enacted s sp48 which
effectively

00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
deregulated uh telecommunications in in
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
most areas uh one area that was not
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
deregulated was pole attachments and so
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
I that's why we find ourselves before
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
you today but nht's view of that is that
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
the existing uh uh mechanism for
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
resolving pole attachment agreements and
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
pole attachment disputes is working well
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and this legislation is effectively a
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
form of
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
re-regulation which will uh create more
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory uh headaches and problems for
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
companies like the NHA companies uh the
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
current system is that uh the Pu rules
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
strongly favor private contracts uh
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
these are sophistic ated parties they uh
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
engage in arms length negotiations they
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
represent their interests well and they
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
reach agreements on the attachments uh
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
where they can't uh reach an agreement
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
or or where an existing agreement uh
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
falls short they can go to the Pu and
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
they can present their uh facts their
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and they can have a case
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
specific uh adjudication and and
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
assignment of rates uh from the Pu based
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
on this on the facts of the parties that
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
are before them what this legislation
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
does is turn that on its head starts out
 
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
with a state um mandated Formula One
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
siiz fits-all formula for all owners and
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
attachers uh and uh it effectively uh
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
negates or nullifies those contracts
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
because you'll know as you are entering
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
into that contract that there's a state
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
formula out there and if your
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
calculation shows that you're better off
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
under the formula then you are under a
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
contract then you'll go straight to the
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
Pu and say please oppose please impose
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
this formula so it will uh it will uh uh
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
injure and and harm that arms length
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
negotiation process for those private
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
contracts it will unbalance that
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
negotiation um and in our view that's uh
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
a waste of time and and resources uh we
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
think the legislation uh creates a lot
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
of open-ended questions
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
um there are um cases around the country
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
where State imposed uh pole rates have
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
been found to be a a constitutional
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
violation of the taking Clause uh New
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New England have not gone
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
that route yet uh but at the same time
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
we've not had a state uh mandated
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
formula for pole rates so far so that
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
would be one piece of uh litigation that
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
we might see coming down the road uh so
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
uh we think that the proper course for
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
the house would be to uh send this bill
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
to interim study uh we think that it
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
would be wise to explore some of the
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
implications of the legislation uh and
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
understand uh the real impacts uh before
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
you take it up again so thank you we're
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I have a question
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
for you I heard the department stay
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
earlier that this formula once it's
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
developed would only be used in the case
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
where where two parties couldn't agree
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
to a contract it would be a kind of a
 
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.750 align:start position:0%
to a contract it would be a kind of a
fallback

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
fallback
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
position but if I understood your
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly you're saying that
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
this formula would become the standard
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
would become the default that everyone
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
would use it would not be a fallback is
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
that your position I think that's
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
clearly the intent of the legislation if
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
you look at the existing pu rules and
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
the six factors uh that Miss Nunan was
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
referring to earlier in her testimony
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
one of those factors is the FCC formula
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
so when you have a a just under a poll
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
contract and you take it to the Pu uh
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
the puc is supposed to set rates for
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
those two parties and one of the factors
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
they consider is the fcc's formula so
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to uh present
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
your facts and your economic situation
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
and for small companies like nhta you
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
know they may have higher costs they may
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
have different factors uh but the FCC
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
formula under the pu's rules has become
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
the driving force in those discussions
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
in SB
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
595 you you start with the formula right
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
the state develops the formula first uh
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
and then you have that hanging out there
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
so that as you're entering into your
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
private negotiations you know that if if
 
00:29:43.149 --> 00:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
you uh if you're looking at this
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
contract you know what the rate that the
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
state wants already is and it's it's uh
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
fairly guaranteed if you take that
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
dispute to the Pu at that point they're
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to they're going to adopt or
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to impose that formula on
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
your on your situation so if you if it
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
favors you that's great if it doesn't
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
favor you you know then you're kind of
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
stuck so you're basically saying that
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
the existence of the formula would
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
preclude good faith negotiations between
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
two parties to to come up with a
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
contract we think it would effectively
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
hinder and hamper those negotiations
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
right I mean you've got a state formula
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
that's been developed in a non-
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding it's not based
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
on you know evidence and facts it's
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
um you know other other factors um and
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be hanging out there as
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
albatross you mentioned earlier that
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation would create quote
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
headaches headaches and problems quote
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
for you the members of your Association
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
could you put some meat on that bone and
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
tell me what kind of headaches and what
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
kind of problems you're talking about
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
well sure yeah the um I mean we we think
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
there are a number of open questions
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
um one is what is the effective
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
enforceability of existing pole
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
contracts if this legislation passes
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
because you really can't uh defend a
 
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:08.070 align:start position:0%
because you really can't uh defend a
pole

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
pole
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
contract uh that is going to be that's
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
going to have rates that are you know in
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
in conflict or in contrast with this
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
state formula so how do you effectively
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
enforce this contract knowing that as
 
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
you're going into the Pu this formula is
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
going to drive drive the discussion so
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know you have contracts you think
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
they're valid but are they enforceable
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
um is there going to be any meaningful
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
process left for adjudicating these
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
contractual disputes uh the intention
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
seems to be that the formula will um
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
streamline that process but the you know
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
the simple fact of the matter is that if
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have any facts to to argue
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
about as you go into an adjudication
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of
 
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.789 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of
adjudicating

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
adjudicating
 
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
um we um as you as you may know um and I
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
think it was alluded to earlier uh pole
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
attachments under federal law fall
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
primarily within the jurisdiction of the
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
FCC uh unless a state has certified to
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
the FCC that it has an effective and
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
fair regulatory scheme on the state
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
level and the Pu in January of 2008 uh
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
certified uh to that fact uh to the FCC
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
uh the FCC rules require that there be a
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
timely adjudication of dispute
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
and we believe that this throws the
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
adjudication process well I won't say
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
out the window but into some question
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so we have some concerns about uh
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
whether this uh statute would continue
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
to comply with FCC standards and whether
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
the 2008 certification would remain uh
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
effective so that's that's another issue
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
that we have um so I I'll I'll stop
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
there we have a number of questions okay
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative has a question thank
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman he can tell when I'm
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
chomping at the bit in a row of
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions um okay so my question is from
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
as I'm listening to you speak what is
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
striking me is that you're here sort of
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
advocating for um companies who own
 
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
polls that are not the utilities not the
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
Monopoly utilities right so there's a
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
there's a market where polls are owned
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
by different individuals and um and this
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
is it correct to assume that this might
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantage those smaller pole owners
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
with this burdensome regulation than it
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
would for sort of the larger folks who
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
um you know they're marketing this bill
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
to us as providing
 
00:33:49.629 --> 00:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
predictability um well our concern is
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
for the smaller companies like granted
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
State like dun Barton
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
telephone um like Bretton Wood's
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
telephone uh that don't have uh
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
substantial customer bases and and uh
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know their their polls are one of
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
their main assets uh and under the
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
present system you know if there's a
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
dispute about the poll attachment rates
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know either the attacher or the
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
owner can take that case to the Pu and
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
have the merits of that case heard based
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
on the you know the facts and the
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances of those parties uh and
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
that seems to be what is trying to be
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
avoided with this legislation is not to
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
have case specific fact specific uh uh
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
resolutions of disputes it seems to be a
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
one siiz fits-all one state One Rate
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
type of uh solution and that is going to
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh burden smaller companies thanks
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas has a
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
for Tak that question and um pardon if I
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand this but would
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
is there any effect either positive or
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
negative or maybe or maybe no effect on
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
this bill in terms of how polls would be
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
replaced or the timing or how fast they
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
would would be replaced if they were had
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
to be replaced or repaired would this
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
bill hamper that process any way or have
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
no relation to that well there there is
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
a relationship I I think we'd have to
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
see what the formula is once it's
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
developed by by the doe uh we don't know
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
based on the statute you know which
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
which factors are going to go into it I
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
mean what we're what we're hearing is
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
that they want to bring it closer into
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
alignment with the FCC formula um but
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation doesn't say we're just
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
adopting the FCC formula they say
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a number of other
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
factors they're going to look at other
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
things that are not currently in the
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
rules so the purpose of a formula at
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
least from the fcc's perspective is to
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
take into account all the costs that the
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
pole owner uh bears in terms of
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
deploying those poles and M maintaining
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
those poles as well as the uh costs that
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
the attacher brings to the situation
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
when they attach their facilities to the
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
polls and all those cost factors are
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be put into a formula and
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
generate a fair and Equitable rate that
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
everybody can agree to that reflects the
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate apportionment of those
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
costs uh I don't see that language in
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
the statud I mean I think there's a an
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
expression of intent about that but we
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't quite know what the formula is is
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
to be at the end of the
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
day followup uh thank you and um I'll
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
ask the question differently I think I
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
understood your answer but in terms of
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
as as you might know we've had issues in
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
the state with polls not being removed
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
that have been sitting there for maybe
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
times sometimes years uh because of who
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
owns the pole how expensive to take it
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
away whatever would the current process
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're under now um be better in terms of
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh getting those polls issues resolved
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
or would the new process speed up the
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
removal and replacement of Old
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
Poles well right so there's nothing in
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
the statute that that speaks of the
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
actual uh M maintain maintenance and and
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
replacement of poles uh it seems evident
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
on the face of the statute that the
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
intent is to reduce the revenues uh if
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
you will for the poll owners uh which
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
means that they will have less Revenue
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
than available for things like pole
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance I mean I will just say I'm
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that my clients are not
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
going to maintain their polls they do a
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
great job I don't believe they have the
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
issues that you're describing which uh
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
May afflict some of the larger companies
 
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
um but you know it is ultimately a a
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
cost versus Revenue effect and the the
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
idea here is to reduce revenues for the
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh you've
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
explained pretty well how this might
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
harm some small companies could could
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
you give a simple explanation of how uh
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
this might lead to higher cost for rate
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
payers well sure I mean as as Chris's
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
testimony suggested this is essentially
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
a resolution of a of a contract dispute
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
between an attacher and a pole owner and
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
the attacher uh didn't like the outcome
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the adjudication and so they're
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
looking for a legislative uh fix to that
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that um the attacher
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
wants to pay
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
less obviously the owner is going to get
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
less um and that's going to uh those
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
those revenues are going to be lost um
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
these are these are pole owning
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
utilities right they're either telephone
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
companies or electric companies or both
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
and they are serving
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
customers uh all across New Hampshire
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
and if they are not getting revenues
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
from attachers they're going to have to
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
make up those revenues elsewhere um the
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
nhta companies as I said in 2008 uh
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
stopped being rate regulated so there's
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
no longer uh you know an immediate uh
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
pass through to the rate payers so
 
00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
they'll have my clients will have to
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
take account of those lost revenues and
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
figure out what the best uh solution is
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
but if they were rate regulated they
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
might well just pass those lost revenues
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
on to their rate
 
00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:24.109 align:start position:0%
on to their rate
payers

00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
followup yeah so I see that as a as a
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
matter of fairness but um you know could
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
that lead to you know increase in
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
charges by the companies that own the
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
polls and a decrease in Chargers by the
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
company that is supplying you know the
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
service or whatever it is they're
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
attaching uh if I understand your
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
question you're asking whether there
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
might be some gaming of rates in play
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
here between competing providers and and
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
we we think there may be some of that I
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
mean I don't want to impune anybody's
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
motivations but uh that at least in
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh the way this legis ation
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
came out of a uh of an adjudicative
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
process at the Pu we think there might
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
be some of that going on you want to
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
speak to that Chris no I think you I
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
think you said it very well
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
representative CL has a
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair thank you for
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
um not following this through the
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
Senate one of my questions I will go
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
with this one since it can be
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicated through the PC
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
PCU uh what percent in the last couple
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
years have gone that route that caused
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation to come before
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
us uh very very few I mean it really is
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
an aberrational case um to to have a a
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
poll rate adjudication at the Pu the
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
system I mean this is this is the uh
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of the Pu rule if you read
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
the existing rule there's a very heavy
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
emphasis on private contracts and that's
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
been in place for you know many many
 
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
years and the system is working well
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
there there are very few disputes that
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
Pu representative Harrington has a
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I you had
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned about um cost shifting so
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
other than the cost that we are pretty
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
familiar with which would be property
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
taxes paid on the polls what costs are
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
associated with your poll having
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else's communication line on
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
it you want to speak to that
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
Chris the the polls themselves obviously
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
have a a life to them uh and there that
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of that is spread over many
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
years essentially the formula entertains
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
what it is what the costs the inputs are
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
um to come up with that poll attachment
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
rate and if there's a process at the Pu
 
00:41:58.589 --> 00:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
which in some cases May artificially
 
00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
reduce that attachment rate then those
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
costs would simply have to be pushed
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere else okay follow up follow up
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
yeah when I'm let's let's forget about
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
the Pu and all the government stuff
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about your company you
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
have a poll out there you run your I
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
assume a telephone line on it um maybe
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
there's an electric line on it maybe
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
there's a cable line on it maybe there's
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
a internet line on it how how those T
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
other than your line what cost do you
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
incur by having those other attached to
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
your pole the the taxes and just the
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing expenses which may include uh
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
ice and snow pulling those lines down uh
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance um requiring the
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
cost of replacement of the pole Etc okay
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
one more question but you don't replace
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
the in other words if you let's use this
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
the regretful the last month we've had a
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
large number of polls come down all
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
across the
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
state if uh you have your poll and it
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
and it comes
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
down um I'm just trying to get assess
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
the cost so if it hits somebody else's
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
line and that causes the pole to snap
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
then you are stuck with replacing the
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
cost of the pole regardless of why it
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
came down that's correct most of the for
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
Grant State Communications most of the
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
polls that we own we we share with
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
eversource there are some cases where we
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
have solely owned poles and then where
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
we rent space from other uh pole owners
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of them are owned
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
by uh in our areas are owned by half are
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
owned by us and the other half of the
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
poll is owned by ever Source we share
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
that ownership so the more
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
attachments we bear the the cost of
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
replacing that pole okay representative
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
hering here and other people would like
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
to ask questions too representative
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
parshall has a
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
for being here today in 2013 the public
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
aties commission uh did devise a formula
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
that um is sometimes applied in these
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
cases I believe did that result in a uh
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
closing down of negotiation in any way
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
when according to your scenario um of
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
how um this could be detrimental to
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
negotiation did that have an effect on
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's a great question and um I I've
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
only read the decisions I've not been
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
involved in any of those adjudications
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
because uh the nhda companies have not
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
had uh occasion to have those disputes
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
but the way that the system works now is
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
that you if if you're an grieved
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
attacher or an agreed poll owner you
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
take the case to the
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
Pu uh and one of the factors they
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
consider is this FCC formula the FCC
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
formula certainly drives the discussion
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
um but the Pu is able Within in those
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
case specific adjudications to take
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
account of other factors that are unique
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
or or specific to the individual parties
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
so the formula does uh weigh heavily in
 
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.470 align:start position:0%
so the formula does uh weigh heavily in
the

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
discussions uh followup please followup
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
and it's your belief that a a formula to
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
replace the existing formula would not
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
be as uh uh moldable me um meltable as
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
far as um allowing those negotiations
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we do want to have happen
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
right now I think my point was that uh
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
well first of all we don't know what the
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
formula will be because it still needs
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be defined and and the factors that
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
are listed in the statute are different
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
from those that are in the the rule
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
right now uh but I think my My overall
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
point was that uh knowing that there's
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
this formula out there that is is
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
blessed by the state right it's been
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
blessed by the doe and the Pu and that
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
they know that they're going to use it
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know Faithfully in every every
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
dispute um creates you know it it it
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
sways the discussion it will it tilts
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
tilts the balance if you will in the in
 
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
those negotiations representative
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um so as I'm
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
listening to this it seems that the
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
driver of your uh position comes from
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
the belief that a uh formula is going to
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
give end up giving the companies less
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue than they currently uh have
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
available to them or put them in a worse
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
position in any kind of
 
00:46:32.839 --> 00:46:34.510 align:start position:0%
position in any kind of
negotiation

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
so do you have the ability to make the
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
case in the discussions with the setting
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the formula that's going to be
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
adopted to present a position that will
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
influence a a formula that's going to
 
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
take care of you from a from a a cost
 
00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.270 align:start position:0%
take care of you from a from a a cost
perspective

00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
I mean I I I expect we will take part in
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
I mean if if the legislation passes
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
we'll take part in that non adjudicative
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh a non- adjudicative
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
proceeding is different from an
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
adjudication because it's not uh based
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
on specific facts that apply to specific
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
parties it's based on larger policy
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions and the p and the doe in this
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
case will take account of all the
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
comments but they're not strictly Bound
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
by evidentiary rules or evidentiary
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
standards they don't have to
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know adjudicate a particular dispute
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
so I mean we U we'll we'll take part if
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's the case and we'll make our best
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
pitch um I think our concern is that uh
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
we only get the one shot so if if we uh
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
if the P if the doe doesn't doesn't
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
believe us on that day uh we're we're
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
stuck until the next uh non-
 
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.190 align:start position:0%
stuck until the next uh non-
adjudicative

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
adjudicative
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
rulemaking followup Are there specific
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
criteria that you think would be uh
 
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.790 align:start position:0%
criteria that you think would be uh
important

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
for uh the uh doe to examine and in
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
internalize into the eventual formula
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
that will would would arise from this
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
that would put the companies in a
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
position that then is acceptable to
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
them I mean I I think that we haven't
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
obviously discussed this but I think the
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
the um argument we would make is we'd
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
like to see some dis differentiation in
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
the eventual rule for smaller companies
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
um with uh different uh cost criteria so
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
we we'd want to see some ability to
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
distinguish uh smaller from larger and
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
local from National and you know all
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
that stuff uh in terms of uh the impact
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
rule okay members I would like you to
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
consider holding your f f further
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions for future testifiers we have
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
four more people who would like to
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
testify additional perspectives we'd
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
like here thank you so thank you
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for being here I've heard
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of times now effect
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
on rate payers well if there is anybody
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
in this room who can uh tell us more
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
about the effect on rate
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
payers other than our consumer Advocate
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know who that would be so I'd
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
like to call next on our consumer
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
Advocate the rate payer Watchdog Donald
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
cre to give us his P perspective on this
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh thank thank thank you
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose and good morning to you
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
and to members of the committee uh as
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
you all know I'm Donald Cree the uh
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate my job by Statute is
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
to Advocate on behalf of the state's
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers and uh my
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
testifying today might be an example of
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
fools rushing in Where Angels Fear To
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
Tread in that I am not an expert on poll
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
attachment uh and the rules that are
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
applicable there too uh so I don't have
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
a lot to say about this bill my
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
recommend recation to you is identical
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
to the one you just heard from Mr
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
Phillips which is to consign this bill
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
to interim study and here's why and
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
really Representatives Kennedy and muns
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
have already made my case for me uh the
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
cost of maintaining a network of utility
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
polls is a zero sum game the companies
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
that own polls are going to recover
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
their costs from somebody one way or
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
another so if the third-party companies
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
that attach their facilities to a
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
utilities polls don't cover the costs or
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they don't cover the
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
costs incurred by the pole owner then
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
the pole owner is going to turn around
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
and charge its regulated rate payers
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
we're moving to an era in New Hampshire
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
where utility poles are going to be
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
owned by our electric distribution
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
companies and while I really love our
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
electric distribution companies none of
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
them are Charities all of them are going
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
to recover from their regulated captive
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
customers whatever they do not recover
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
from pole attachers my understanding
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
about this bill first of all it struck
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
me that the proponents of the bill who
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
have testified so far today don't seem
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
to understand the bill and its
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
implications which to me suggests a good
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
reason to send for sending this to
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
interim study so we can all think about
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
it some more and make sure that we do
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
the right thing Visa V rate payers
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
because we are as rate payers the only
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
wallet in the room and um the other
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
point I would make is that it does
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
indeed appear to me that what happened
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
here is that there was a contentious uh
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
poll attachment case that was pending
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
before the puc that the poll attacher
 
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
did not like the results of and the
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
result is this bill that was presented
 
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
to you I unfortunately did not testify
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
about this in the Senate uh my practice
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
these days is not to look for reasons to
 
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
testify at the state house but only to
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
go and appear at hearings when asked to
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
and I just wasn't paying attention to
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
pole attachments over in the other body
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
but I did hear about this bill from both
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
sides and I've come to my own
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
independent judgment which is I think
 
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
this bill should be consigned to interim
 
00:52:10.589 --> 00:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
study that's the extent of my testimony
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
and of course I'd be happy to uh
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
entertain friendly and non-friendly
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Kennedy
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I mean right
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
now it seems like the FCC has the main
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
body of rules the Pu can make some
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments and there's a private
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
negotiation is there anything wrong with
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
that system uh no this is an example I
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
think of cooperative federalism at work
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh back when I was General Counsel of
 
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
the Pu in 2018 or seven uh the question
 
00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
came up like do we continue to allow the
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
FCC to do the regulating of poll
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
attachments or do we claw back some of
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
the authority because the Comm tele
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
Federal Telecommunications Act allow
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
states to do exactly what New Hampshire
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
did which is pass a statute saying no
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
our commission is going to regulate that
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
but the FCC does have a role it does
 
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
establish that formula it's entitled to
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
some respect and deference so I think
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
that in terms of who is best equipped to
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
regulate what the amount of money is
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
that poll attachers get it is best done
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
on the state level and that is in fact
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
what we do but the FCC does continue to
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
play a
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
role follow up so is the answer
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
no is the answer your question to me was
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
is does the existing Paradigm is it okay
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
and I think it is okay this bill would
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
tweak it in a way whose effects I think
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
are intended to be more costs to
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
electric and other rate payers of pole
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
owners less costs to the unregulated
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
companies that also need to use polls
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington asked before
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
about I I think his questions had to do
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
with what's the incremental cost if you
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
add another uh wire to a utility pole
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the answer is nothing essentially or
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
very little but that doesn't mean that
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
you should be able to attach your wires
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
to poles for free if you're a pole
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
attacher and you're making money by
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
using the uh network of polls in a
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
particular territory then you should pay
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
your fair share of those costs and if
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
you don't pay your fair share of those
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
costs the people who are going to make
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
up the difference are captive raid
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
payers that's my ultimate point
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
question microphone
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
please thank you chair Mr cre thank you
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I'm going to
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
ask you a question I was going to ask
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
further because you mentioned a r pair
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
and being involved in similar contracts
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
like this as a small business owner I
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
was going to ask them the questions of
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
length of term and things like that
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
but going back to the rate
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
pair I'm a small business I have no
 
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
choice to look for other polls those are
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
the only ones in
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
Monopoly I had to look for a
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
longterm contract because I knew I was
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
paying too much but I needed to spread
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
it out and over the course everything
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
worked but
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
you're brought up a point about the
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
large distribution company's taking it
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
over they don't need to do what I did
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
they just passed it on and say correct I
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
think that that is correct
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Thomas has a question
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you for
 
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
being here uh you've mentioned now in
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
term study and the the last group of
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
people also mentioned that what is it in
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
this bill that is worth saving or
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
investigating by going to interm study
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
and why not just kill
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
it well I I suppose
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
I I've been told that there are
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between the way the Pu
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
decided the dispute over how to
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
compensate uh or how how much ever
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
should eversource should have been
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to pay for the polls it bought
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
from Consolidated which implicates a lot
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
of the same issues and the poll
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
attachment dispute that the Pu resolved
 
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
that was the subject of rehearing
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
motions and a lot of protracted
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
litigation so what I don't understand
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
and what I think you might also not
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
understand is really what the what the
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
best public policy is here around Fair
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
allocation of pole attachment costs
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
utility polls are very important and our
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
Network Industries are very important
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
right okay seeing no further questions
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
from the consumer Advocate we want to
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%

as amended and we thank doe and other

stakeholders for their efforts in
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
helping to craft this
 
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
legislation we believe that this is an
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
important clarification to existing
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
statute as you've heard it directs the
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
doe to adopt a poll attachment rate
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
formula using historical cost data and
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
it provides guidance to the doe and pu
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
on resolving pole attachment disputes
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
when and if they
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
arise this does not change Reliance on
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
agreements and it also does not change
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
the forum for disputes from the New
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
FCC current law calls upon the doe to
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
develop a pole attachment formula and
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
additionally as you've heard the
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
rules contain up to six factors
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
including a formula that the Pu should
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
consider when determining whether a pole
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
attachment rate is unjust and
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
unreasonable in the event of a dispute
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
the process and these
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
factors are vague ambiguous and
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
amorphous they were adopted in
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
2007 and they were applied and tested
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
2023 the formula adopted pursuant to 595
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
as amended would be simpler and
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
transparent ensuring maximum Clarity and
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
predictability for all stakeholders
 
01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
it is not one size fits-all it is not
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
rate setting it is the adoption of a
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
formula that would consider many inputs
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
that I want to mention that currently
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
evera and other utilities use formulas
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
very similar to the FCC formula that is
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
currently the practice for many
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
utilities so this is not a dress IC
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
change for that group of
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
utilities as I mentioned sener Bill 595
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
is amended would create more
 
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
predictability it directs the agency to
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
give difference to the
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
longstanding widely accepted and
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
judicially approved FCC formula while
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
allowing them flexibility to determine
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
what is right for New Hampshire
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
that formula the FCC
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
formula is in place in a great majority
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
of us States including Maine
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont and
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut in fact most New Hampshire
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
pole owners and attachers already
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
operate in states where an FCC based
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
formula is in
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
place New Hampshire currently is truly
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
unique and an outlier
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
relative to calculating pole attachment
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
rates again in the event of a
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
dispute we have submitted written
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
testimony or I have testimony that I
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
will submit and there is more
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
information in that uh regarding the
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
practice in other
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
states so the advantages of a formula
 
01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039 align:start position:0%
based on based on the FCC formula are
 
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
numerous it's well known and understood
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
to parties it has been found to be
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory and fully
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
compensatory to poll owners and fair to
 
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
attachers it has been fully litigated
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
under federal
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
law this type of certainty would
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
actually reduce the likelihood of
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
litigation which is expensive and is
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
also a cost that is passed on to rate
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
payers my understanding to give you an
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
example is that in Massachusetts where
 
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
an FCC based formula is in place there
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
has not been a dispute on rates since
 
01:02:34.079 --> 01:02:38.269 align:start position:0%
has not been a dispute on rates since
the

01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
1990s importantly this bill also calls
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
upon the agency to develop an
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
accelerated dispute resolution
 
01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
process in December of 2023 in
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing that lengthy and expensive
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
disputes were delaying investment in in
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
Broadband deployment the FCC adopted an
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
accelerated dispute resolution process
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
for the 30 states that are not certified
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
and who defer poll regulation to the FCC
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire which is
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
certified uh to the FCC that it will
 
01:03:15.039 --> 01:03:16.710 align:start position:0%
certified uh to the FCC that it will
regulate

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
disputes an accelerated dispute
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
resolution process should be
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
Paramount quick resolution of disputes
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the event of a dispute
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
provides more predictability certainty
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
disputes again it's important to note
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
that most New Hampshire poll operators
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
and attachers operate in states where
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
these processes are already
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
law such an expedited process is key
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
when one considers that in many cases
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
polls are owned by the competitors to
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
the entities which are seeking to attach
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
to them utility polls are among the last
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
remaining Monopoly Assets in an
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
increasingly deregulated industry there
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
is no economically viable alternative to
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
attaching to utility poles for Wired
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
networks and there should be no
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive incentive to create
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
delay in
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
deployment the avoidance of disputes
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
expeditious expeditious resolution of
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
disputes relative to pull attachment
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
rates is is significant in that again
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
money and time is not spent on
 
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
litigation when rapid deployment is
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
key lastly Senate Bill 595 clarifies
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
that the agency has the authority to
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
implement the statute and require pole
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
owners to maintain the necessary records
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
to justify their poll attachment rates
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
and make that information available to
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
the attachers to verify the accuracy of
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
rates transparency in record keep in and
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the process is of utmost importance
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
so in
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion uh just to summarize we
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
believe that this clarifies the law it
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely aligns New Hampshire with
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
other states it creates predictability
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
in calculating pole attachment rates
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
creates processes for dispute avoidance
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
and expeditious
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
resolution it improves
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
transparency and truly it helps a line
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
Resources with priorities around
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
deployment of infrastructure so we ask
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
that you recommend Senate Bill 595 ought
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended by the Senate and I'd
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
like to turn to Susan to see if she has
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
comments to add and we're happy to take
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
you good morning um I don't have
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything in particular to add to what
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
Mora has stated but I would be happy to
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
take any questions that the committee
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
so I have a question for you Miss Weston
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned that an accelerated dispute
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
resolution process is
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
needed I read through the text of this
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't see any mention of that
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
is it somewhere in here that I just
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
don't see or can you explain that to me
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's right I think that in um what
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
would become the new section
 
01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
would become the new section
10

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
um see
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's 10
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
A6 um that that would give the
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the commission I'm sorry the
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
commission need would need to conduct a
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
formal root rule making to incorporate
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
the formula that the department of
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
energy develops along with rules for
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
Accelerated dispute resolution that's on
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
the the um line 24 correct yes
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions for
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
Miss geyser representative
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chair and um thank you
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
for coming in and meeting with us this
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
morning um as an organization that um uh
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
does cover um all of New England uh I'm
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you can uh answer the
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
question I had asked earlier about
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
um what the impact or how how rates in
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently compare to Maine
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts Connecticut and
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
you know what would the what would the
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
impact of this be on those
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
rates yes I can give you one data point
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
um in in New Hampshire Consolidated
 
01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
Communications and this was back in as
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
of 2022 this is the data I have
 
01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
Consolidated in New Hampshire charges
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
for a solely owned poll poll that it
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
owns by itself um it charges each
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
attacher or I'll say it charges um some
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
necta members as attachers
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
$167 per year per attachment so for
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
every attachment on every single poll
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
that Consolidated owned in
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
2022 each of those attachments was
 
01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
assessed the charge of
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
$167 on a solely owned pole in Maine the
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
comparable figure or charge was
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
$356 so and on a jointly owned poll on a
 
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
poll that Consolidated owned with
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
another entity like eversource for
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
example um Consolidated charged
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
$684 in New Hampshire per attachment per
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
poll annually and in Maine uh
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
a178 thank you okay I additional
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative licki has one
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
question um are there businesses in New
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have been um unable to
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
operate either temporarily or in the
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
longer term because they were not able
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
to attach to polls or was this strictly
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
issue thank you for the question I I'll
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
I'll phrase it this way to the extent
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that a pole attacher is trying to
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
gain access to polls to serve new
 
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
customers and is unable to
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate a rate with the pole owner
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
then deployment of the attachers assets
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
will be delayed we think this bill will
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate that delay in Broadband
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
deployment by allowing a formulaic
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
approach to the issue of what rates
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
should be charged uh to that attacher
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
and that can expedite deployment
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and this question
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
may have been asked I was late to the
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
hearing uh so if it it has been I
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
apologize um how many poll disputes um
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
occur on a yearly
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
basis I'm only aware in the last say 12
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
years at the Pu I'm aware of two cases
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
that actually went to
 
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
adjudication I'm not familiar with the
 
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
number of disputes that occur that are
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
um resolved informally I'm just aware of
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
two cases that were actually adjudicated
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
at the PC there may have been more
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
coming in this morning to to talk to us
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh I was just talking to my wife this
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
morning and she mentioned that we have
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
two internet providers in our town and
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
if I understand you correctly this bill
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
would increase the number of Internet
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
providers in rural areas would that be
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
correct to to to draw that
 
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion I I I don't see that this
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
bill actually goes to that issue but I
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
think to the extent that the bill
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
provides certainty and an objectively
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable standard for setting pole
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
attachment rates I think it will be
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps more efficient and expeditious
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
for a potential attacher to reach
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
agreement with the pole owner so that
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
the attachers broad facilities could be
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
deployed more expeditiously than
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
currently representative followup go
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
ahead so so this bill
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
would possibly benefit um operators are
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
already in the state it would not bring
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
in are you saying you to your knowledge
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are no waiting you know there's
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
not a backlog of people waiting to get
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
into the state to do business on those
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
polls I I don't I don't have the answer
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
to that that
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
question representative Harrington has a
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question we had a lot of
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
discussion with the previous uh speakers
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
on um what the effect with this would be
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it appears if I'm correct me if I'm
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
wrong on this but it appears that there
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be really no negotiation on either
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
the attacher or the pole owner's part
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
they would simply go to the formula and
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
figure out okay I'm going to get charged
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
I can charge you x amount that's what
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to charge you or or on the
 
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
attachers point of view saying you can
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
only charge me x amount that's what I'm
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
going to pay you and what would be any
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
why would anyone negotiate a different
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
rate if it was already know that the
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
fallback was based on statute I mean
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's the one it's going to be
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
effectively become the rate isn't it so
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
I'll start and then maybe Susan can back
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
clean up to help answer the
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
question uh the FCC formula
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
has been or I should say 30 or so States
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh seed authority to the
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
FCC and the FCC formula it is well known
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
it has been adjudicated it is supported
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
by a body of law that is comp U
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
compensatory and just um for for both
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
parties and my sense is poll attachment
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
negotiations occur regularly there are
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
voluntary agreements
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that this body of law
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
exists I don't see that it that this
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
bill changes the voluntary negotiations
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
between the parties
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever uh these factors are well
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
known what we're talking about is what
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
happens in the event of a dispute and
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
the six factor analysis under our
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
regulations are vague and amorphous
 
01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.669 align:start position:0%
regulations are vague and amorphous
and

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
create I think challenges and may lead
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
to more disputes rather than fewer
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
disputes that's my general sense Susan
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
do you I'll just add one quick thing um
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington the poll
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
attachers and the pole owners negotiate
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
these voluntary agreements rates are
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
just one element of those agreements
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
there are other terms and conditions for
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
Access that are contained in those
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
agreements so I don't think it's necess
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
neily a given that a rate that is
 
01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
produced by this for formula is
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
automatically going to be uh inserted
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
into the contract there may be some give
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
and take in that negotiation process
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
whereby the poll attacher is willing to
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
pay a higher rate for more favorable
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions that are not
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
Financial I thank you representative
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
muns has the last question for these two
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yeah I just want to
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on that um um Exchange with
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington so so if I if
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
I heard what you said
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
correctly 595 would not impose a
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
specific rate that it would only be a
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
rate that would go into effect if the
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
parties couldn't negotiate so they would
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
still be
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
negotiating that's
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you I would just like
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
to add one quick thing to that and is my
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is not one size
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
fits-all when you look at the formula it
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
really comes down to inputs and one set
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
of inputs for one pole owner could look
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
very different than the inputs for
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
another pole owner so this is not one
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
size fits-all but I would add any
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
formula that is adopted and if it's
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
based on the FCC formulas must be fully
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
compensatory to the pole owner regarding
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
the cost associated with that attachment
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
so I think representative Harrington may
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
have asked this question earlier about
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
the UTI's ability or the poll owner's
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
ability to recover its cost the FCC and
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
the courts have held that the fcc's
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
formulas are fully compensatory and
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
they're just and reasonable and that's
 
01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
what rate making is all about is to
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
produce a just and reasonable
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
rate okay you've helped us a lot to
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
understand the issues here so I want to
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you both for coming to talk to us
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
this morning thank you next we'll hear
 
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
from one of the largest pole owners in
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
the state ever Source Michael Lata will
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
give us his P perspective on this
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
welcome good
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
morning Michael Lata representing
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
eversource and as uh the chair pointed
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
out we uh own either in whole or in part
 
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.390 align:start position:0%
out we uh own either in whole or in part
uh

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
48 uh I'm sorry 480,000
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
utility polls uh throughout our service
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
territory in New Hampshire and we are uh
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
in support of the legislation before you
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
today um the reason that we support is
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
because we do believe uh that there is
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
value in the department of energy
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
setting a uniform formula rate uh that
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be used uh in the case of disputes
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utilities Commission we
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
think that that will provide a level of
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
consistency and transparency that would
 
01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:26.560 align:start position:0%
benefit both poll owners as well as
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
attachers and ultimately uh customers of
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
both uh telecommunication services and
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh our our customers our electric rate
 
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.189 align:start position:0%
uh our our customers our electric rate
payer

01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
payer
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
customers um as uh I think was mentioned
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
by representative partial uh in 2013 the
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission uh did in
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
fact approve a settlement uh between
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
eversource and several
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunications Pro uh providers uh
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
which set set the formula rate that
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
eversource uses today so our rate has
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
actually been set excuse me our formula
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
has actually been set by pu order which
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
I think is is a little bit unusual
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
compared to the other electric
 
01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.510 align:start position:0%
compared to the other electric
distribution

01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
utilities um and so that is a a bit of a
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
blended rate uh between the FCC
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and FCC cable rates
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh and that is the formula that we we
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
apply today um and with that I'll just
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
say that I appreciate the bill sponsor
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders willingness to
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
work with us uh in the Senate to address
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that we had raised
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
originally with the bill uh and we are
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
in support of the legislation before you
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
today okay thank you representative muts
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr LCA for being here uh we heard
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
just in previous testimony that um that
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh in Maine at least um the the rates
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
for uh pole the pole attachment rates
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
are lower than they currently are in New
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so assuming that that is the
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
case in that that would happen in New
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
um you would suffer a pretty significant
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue loss on your 4 180,000 polls how
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
would you make that up yeah I think
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
there's an assumption in in the question
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
and I think there's been assumptions
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
made um during the hearing today that um
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
the doe is going to make a finding of a
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
a substantially different formula than
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
we have in place today or something
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
lower uh than we have today as uh
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
attorney guer had said um you know the
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
FCC formula is designed to um uh make
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
pole owners whole uh but also there are
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
other factors uh unique to New Hampshire
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
potentially that the department of
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
energy and the Public Utilities
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
Commission would take into account when
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
either setting the rate or or uh
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
mediating a dispute so um you know it
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
really depends on the rate that the
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
department of energy would set and the
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh resolution of a dispute uh that the
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission uh would
 
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
mediate between pole owners and pole
 
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
attachers on on whether there would be
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh a change in in Revenue followup
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
um the the rate that was negotiated or
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
adjudicate ated by the the Pu what what
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
is that rate I was worried you were
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask me that but I did come
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
prepared um so it is
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
0.44 times the space Factor times the
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
net cost of the bare pole squared times
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
the carrying charge rate squared and the
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
space Factor formula which I can go into
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
if you'd like uh is is also in uh um in
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
the order and that's basically the
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
usable space of the pole uh the pole
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
height the number of
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
attachers uh and the usable
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
space did you need to follow up on that
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh so say it's it's a fairly technical
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
formula that reminds me of the joke
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
about the accountant when you know when
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
someone asked him if they could explain
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
something and the accountant gave a very
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
precise answer and person said well you
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
must be an accountant because it you
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
know doesn't help me at all all I can
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
promise you I'm not an accountant okay
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
thank you all right further questions
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
for Mr Lata representative
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
Kaplan uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr lato I'm going to try my luck
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
with you uh and ask my the same question
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
do you in your opinion do do you think
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would increase the number of
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
businesses operating in the state in
 
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
terms of uh internet providers and and
 
01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:49.719 align:start position:0%
cable providers like that I I I would
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
say um potentially you
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
know in the puc order back in
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
2013 um the Commission in its findings
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
noted that uh by setting the formula
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
rate that they did uh their Hope was
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
that it would increase the amount of
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
telecommunications infrastructure in the
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
state while balancing obviously the the
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
interest of of customers and and
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
shareholders so having a standardized
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
formula does that make the state more
 
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
attractive to a broadband provider I
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
mean you'd have to ask them but um you
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
know I think that was part of the uh the
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
commission's analysis when approving our
 
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.669 align:start position:0%
commission's analysis when approving our
formula

01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
rate representative Kennedy has a
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah the the last speaker said
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
that the bill would increase the
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
standing of the FCC rules so I'm a
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
little confused are we ignoring those
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
rules now so it I I will
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
so I will say no um
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
there in the case of eversource
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
settlement formula which was adopted in
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
2013 um they are quite consistent with
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
different components of FCC formula
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
rates so there's a telecommunication
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
rate and there's a uh cable rate please
 
01:23:19.149 --> 01:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
don't ask me why they're differentiated
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps Miss Gyer attorney guer could
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh could explain that um but but it is
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh that does form the basis and I would
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
also note there has been mention of sort
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the six Factor test that the
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
commission uh is required to use when uh
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicate adjudicating disputes and the
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
FCC formula rate is is one of those
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
factors in
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
that representative PL has a
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair thank you Mr
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
Lata uh I'm still hung up on the need of
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
this um going just to mention um Miss
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
lon's comment she said there was a
 
01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um my notes are not as good
 
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
as representative corman's
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
F that was put in in 2007 I don't expect
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
you to noce I'm leading up to the
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
question okay but hasn't been used to
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
2023 then there was another
 
01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
disputes if I heard right goes back to
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
1990 I'll check what represent Corbin of
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
all my ears
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
but everu being a major player my
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
question is can you share some of the
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
disputes you had that needed to go to
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
the Pu in the last few years thank you
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll there has been made reference
 
01:24:49.109 --> 01:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
to a recent dispute that was not a
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
dispute that involved ever source is
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
what what I will say um you know we did
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
have the settlement that I referenced
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
that was uh a complaint that was filed
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
back uh by
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
telecommunications providers back in
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
2012 and was uh again the end result of
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
that is we were able to come to a
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
settlement file that settlement uh
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Pu that was approved
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that has been um the formula that
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we have used I I'll you know I
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to sort of overstep I'll
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
defer to others in the telecommunication
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
space who might speak to the specifics
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
of of the most recent dispute and that I
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
think uh moved things along and the uh
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you uh that you
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
referenced I think was the um that six
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
part uh that six Factor test that the
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
commission is required to use when uh
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
determining whether a uh a formula rate
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
is is fair and in the public
 
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.149 align:start position:0%
is is fair and in the public
interest

process prior to the case that initiated
 
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
process prior to the case that initiated
this

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
this

telecommunications infrastructure uh our
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
work is crucial cral in providing
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
connectivity to Anchor institutions
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
across New England including to schools
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%

customers and have 500 miles of Route
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
fiber facilitating vital Communications
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
across the state on which every sector
 
01:27:22.109 --> 01:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
individual and Community relies as a
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
neutral host provider collaborating
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
across various sectors here in the State
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
Crown Castle is uniquely positioned to
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
discuss today's topic an essential
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
component of infrastructure that's often
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
overlooked until it becomes a bottleneck
 
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
in our shared goal of closing the
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
digital divide and ensuring fast
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
reliable connectivity utility
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
polls these polls are vital as they
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
provide a prevalent and widely available
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
foundation on which to deploy the wire
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
line and wireless facilities necessary
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
to deliver the connectivity that granted
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
State residents require and deserve
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
without timely access to well-maintained
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
utility polls at reasonable and
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
transparent rates terms and conditions
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
providing this connectivity becomes a
 
01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:05.950 align:start position:0%
providing this connectivity becomes a
serious

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
serious
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
challenge which is why we support Senate
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 595 as amended this legislation
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
represents a crucial step towards
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
resolving significant inefficiencies in
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's poll attachment system
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
currently aiming to replace the current
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
2007 vague multiactor rate test with a
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
clear formula based rate system to
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
streamline processes increasing
 
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
transparency and reducing unnecessary
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
delays this formula will leverage
 
01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
historical cost data ensuring rates are
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
fair transparent and consistent with
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
practices in neighboring states like
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
Maine and Vermont as well as in line
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
with the poll attachment formula set by
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
this law of course would be proactive to
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
new disputes I'd like to highlight we
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
were not a party to that dispute
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
everybody keeps talking about with the
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
Public Utility Commission um in addition
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
an accelerated dispute resolution
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
process which is in line with what the
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
FCC recently adopted given all of the
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
funding for Broadband federally um would
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
be something we strongly support
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
currently resolving disputes can take up
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
to 180 days in the state in the digital
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
age where connectivity is increasingly
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
synonymous with opportunity safety and
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
access to vital Services these delays
 
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.229 align:start position:0%
access to vital Services these delays
are

01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
unacceptable this bill will sign if ific
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
L reduced timelines ensuring um
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
resolutions and facilitating faster
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
Broadband deployment which becomes
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
increasingly important as we look at the
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
historic moment we're
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
in with $318 million from the federal
 
01:29:39.510 --> 01:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
government allocated to New Hampshire
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
for Broadband expansion through arpa and
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
the be programs timely and fair access
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
to utility polls has become even more
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
critical while these polls might seem
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
mundane they're the backbone of our
 
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
efforts to connect every corner of the
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
state in a cost effective way delays in
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
accessing polls can also jeopardize not
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
only the timely use of federal funds but
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
also our broader goals of connectivity
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
and economic growth in Practical terms
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
imagine a scenario where a deployment is
 
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
stalled because the poll owner and the
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
Broadband provider cannot agree on poll
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
attachment rates or dispute stragon for
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
months if a poll owner is Slow Rolling
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
negotiating a poll attachment agreement
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
or granting access that's where
 
01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
accelerated dispute resolution can
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
really save projects otherwise these
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
delays could mean not only missing out
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
on federal dead deadlines but also
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
delaying crucial connectivity for
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
schools that need internet for learning
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
for hospitals that rely on data for
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
patient care and for businesses that
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
need Broadband to complete compete in
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
the global
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
Marketplace in addition as a company
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
that attaches Wireless facilities to
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
polls we want to highlight that the vast
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
majority of 911 calls are made via a
 
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
wireless device on un served and un uh
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
unserved and underserved areas POS a
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
significant risk in situations where
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
timely arrival by First Responders could
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
quite literally mean the difference
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
between life and death the last thing we
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
need in upgrading this kind of
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure are unnecessary delays
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
caused by unpredictable pole attachment
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
disputes in conclusion we urge the
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee to support Senate Bill 595
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
ensuring that New Hampshire doesn't miss
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
out on an unprecedented opportunity to
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
enhance its Communications
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and I'm happy to take any
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you do you have written
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
testimony to submit by any chance I
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
could send it to you I don't have it on
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
me though okay thank you I appreciate
 
01:31:36.669 --> 01:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
that questions representative Harrington
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
has one thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um we've been
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
talking generally about attachments here
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
but uh that can involve more than just
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
putting up a new wire on a telephone
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
poll uh what I'm referring to do you
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
think this bill addresses the issue of
 
01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:55.719 align:start position:0%
all right there's a telephone pole it's
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
got an electric wire on it it's got uh
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
two communication wires on it and now
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
two more companies want to put things on
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
there and it requires movement of the
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
existing ones probably not the electric
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
one because that's going to always be on
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
top but the other two so does this bill
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
cover the cost associated with I've
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
already paid you my wire's up there now
 
01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
you want me to move it so you can put
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
another wire up there yeah great
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
question I was talking to my team before
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
about this so when we put a node we do
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
an engineering analysis for a kind of
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
node we would attach to a poll so what
 
01:32:30.669 --> 01:32:30.679 align:start position:0%
would happen in that scenario is we'd
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
still if if it was on us on our
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
attachment we would still have to bear
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of replacing the pole through
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
our normal negotiation process so that's
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
irrespective kind of of this what we're
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
talking about here what what what I'm
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead yeah what what I'm
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
referring to here is that the poll's
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
there it's existing now a new company
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
comes in and says I want to attach to
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
the poll and they make an agreement with
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
the the owner of the pole does that
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
include the cost of another company
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's already attached to the pole
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
having to move their wire because they
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
physically needs to be spaced out more
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
because you you're adding one or two
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
more wires to the pole so is this bill
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
going to cover that addition because
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
someone's going to have to pay for that
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
if company a is has to move their wire
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
because Company B wants to attach
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
company a wants to get paid for doing it
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
does this bill address that issue yeah
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're currently not seeing problems with
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
that in this state the One Touch make
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
ready process that's kind of separate
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
from this um discussion but we would
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
have the normal negotiation process when
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
we're going back and forth with the pole
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
owner um and this would just come into
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
play to have a predictable process so
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
it's like you're not driving your car
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
without a GPS you know um so you know
 
01:33:43.629 --> 01:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
what the the formula is when you talk to
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
the company beforehand to prevent
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
disputes representative mons thank you
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for uh coming in
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
um you you you spoke quite a bit about
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
um the importance of an accelerated
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution mechanism and and and
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
some other speakers spoke about that as
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
well do you feel that the bill includes
 
01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.270 align:start position:0%
well do you feel that the bill includes
enough

01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
Direction um on that uh I mean right now
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
it's mentioned you know in one place um
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
as a you know General a accelerated
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution mechanism do you
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
think that the legislature needs to be a
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific in terms of
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
what that should
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
include I think is currently written
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the um process that will be under
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
taken after this bill is hopefully
 
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
passed with the Department of energy
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
that all stakeholders will get to weigh
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
in and really come up with what's best
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
for the stakeholders of New Hampshire
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's the poll owners um or the
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
Broadband providers so I think is
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
currently written yes it's it's
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
enough followup followup um but what if
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
the if the you know the
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
the the the the department comes back
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
and says you know yeah we'll resolve
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
issues within 180 days I mean that
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound expedited does it no and I
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the intent uh here
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's to resolve disputes within 30 60 90
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
days representative
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um representative
 
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
Harrington was asking if the bill would
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
address a very specific issue but you
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
know when I read this there's nothing
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
specific in this bill it says that a
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
formula shall be developed so how could
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
you even answer a question like
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
that well this bill again will take all
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the department of
 
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
energy um to be able to come up with a
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
um rate based on historical cost data um
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean I understand what you're
 
01:35:49.229 --> 01:35:49.239 align:start position:0%
saying but this will instead of a vague
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
six-part multiactor test where you
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
really can't predict things would put
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
transparent okay seeing no further
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you for being
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
here and uh testifying to us this
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
morning and that will conclude our
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
public hearing on Senate Bill 595 FN and
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
since we
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
are uh significantly behind schedule
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to go directly into
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
603 and ask Grant bossy from uh Senator
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bradley's office to introduce this
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%

01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you very much my
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
name is Grant bossy Deputy Chief of
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
Staff for the New Hampshire Senate and
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce Senate Bill 603 on
 
01:36:51.070 --> 01:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Jeb Bradley the Bill's
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor what is unique
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we lost the old man in the
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
mountains nearly 21 years ago our first
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
in the nation primary is under attack
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
even Daniel Webster moved to
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to run for the Senate but
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
we still have three numbers that are
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
unique to the Granite State
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
63 in use since 1947 for granite Staters
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
603 is more than an area code it's an
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
identity we have songs and bumper
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
stickers and political slogans and craft
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
beers and t-shirts 603 is New Hampshire
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire is 603 the growth of
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
mobile devices has put a strain on the
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
603 area code which of course can never
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
accommodate more than 10 million unique
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
phone numbers at a time if we want to
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
Forstall the need for a second area code
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire perhaps as soon as
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
2027 we need to find a way to reassign
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
dormant and unused numbers to new phone
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
lines Governor sonunu last year signed
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
an executive order to extend the life of
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
the 603 area code but changes in statute
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
are also needed Senate Bill 603 would
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
empower the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
energy and the Public Utilities
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
Commission to adopt conservation
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
measures to the greatest extent Allowed
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
by federal law such as reclaiming
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
defunct and abandoned numbers it would
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
require service providers of voice over
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
internet protocols or VoIP to register
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy when
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
requesting numbering Services I would
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
defer technical questions to the
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy but if you have
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator Bradley I'll make
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
sure to get you an answer thank you for
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
your consideration and hopefully support
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
603 okay thank you representative ner
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
does have a question for you thank you
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you grant so I'm a
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
little bit confused because um people
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
get a new cell phone and they often have
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else's number an old number so
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
isn't that already done I think the
 
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
department can already speak to why
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
numbers might be dormant and not
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
available for reissue and that makes one
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
less number that we have in the 603 area
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
code before for instance Massachusetts
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
508 okay no followup required
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan would like to ask
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
for coming in I have a question about
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
the utility of this bill in terms of the
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time that it saves us at some
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
point there will be a need for another
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
area go do you have an idea of what the
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
time frame would be for that if this
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass I don't I think if New
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population keeps rising and
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
we keep using phones uh we're not you
 
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:28.360 align:start position:0%
know replaced with some sort of Wi-Fi
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
implant in our heads uh we're probably
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
going to need a second area code at some
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
point this would move that date down the
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
line um well right now I think there
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
without the executive order last year
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
without this bill um the department
 
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
estimated we'd run out of numbers in
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
2027 that's just three years away so
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
this would push it down the line I'm not
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
sure how much hopefully the department
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
can tell you how much how much more life
 
01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
this okay seeing no further questions I
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
want to thank you and Senator Bradley
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
for submitting this uh legislation and
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
we'll next hear from Chris Rand from the
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
Granite State Communications we heard
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
from Chris earlier and like to get his
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation as well
 
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.629 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation as well
welcome

01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chairman I I'm again
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire telephone
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
Association um few very brief com
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
comments for the committee this
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
morning um the rural carriers in the New
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telephone Association have not
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
been the numbering resource problem in
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
the past because we just don't hold that
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
many numbers um the challenges inherent
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
in moving for our members in moving to
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
thousands block
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
pooling um would be uh High and the
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
reward would be fairly low again because
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
we hold very few blocks of numbers it's
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
not even clear that all the New
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire telephone Association members
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
have the technology to implement
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
thousands blog pooling um we are in
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment which simply
 
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.830 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment which simply
would

01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
clarify uh that um that the thousands
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
block pooling is uh a not a mandatory
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
process it's a voluntary
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
process and that concludes my
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
comments thank you could you clarify
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
what amendment you're referring to are
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
you refer referring to the amended
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
version of the bill as it came over from
 
01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:27.709 align:start position:0%
version of the bill as it came over from
the

01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
Senate um I believe so yes it it it
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
inserts the words that all service
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
providers that have chosen to
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
pooling do you know do you have a line
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
number where that language might appear
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
um I have it it shows in section two I
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
don't have the full text of it here
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
be it would be around SE in in the
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
19 so it currently says starting on line
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
18 ensuring that all service providers
 
01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
are in compliance with the fcc's
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulations on thousand thousands block
 
01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.990 align:start position:0%
regulations on thousand thousands block
number

01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
pooling and ordering rate Center
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
consolidation that it determines
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
necessary after review and
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
investigation so you're and and the
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
amendment re requested in that section
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
was that all service providers that have
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
chosen to participate in thousands block
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
pooling are in compliance oh okay all
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
right I'll have to double check my email
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
to see U what we've received on that but
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't recall that um
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
what exactly the language you wanted was
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't clear on whether it was
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
already in the amended version from the
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
senate or whether it was something you
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
were asking us to do but I understand
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
now so thank you so representative muns
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair I got
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
two just technical questions um what is
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
what is Thousands block number pooling
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
and what is a rate what our rate Center
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
consolidations so thousands block
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
pooling is is
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
are numbers are handed out on an NPA NXX
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
basis where there are 10,000 numbers in
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
that block and then thousands block
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
pooling is breaking that group of 10,000
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
numbers into 10 1,000 block pools of
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and then those are distributed
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
amongst the different carriers in an
 
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
area such as conquered Manchester ashaa
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
more urban areas where there is
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
competition so they're allocated on that
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
basis rather than these large
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
blocks and then what is a a rate Center
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
consolidation so that would be where
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
there are um there are multiple blocks
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
spread over a a rate
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
Center and they're not used as
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
efficiently as could be and the the that
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
process of thousand block pooling is
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
implemented to reduce the numbers that
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
are allocated to a specific carrier in
 
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
that rate Center and the remaining
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
thousands blocks are allocated amongst
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
the competitors that may be operating in
 
01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.350 align:start position:0%
the competitors that may be operating in
that

01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
area so the basic problem here is that
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
there are numbers that are no longer
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
being used that need to be recaptured so
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
that they can be used in the future
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
yep in areas sorry go ahead pardon me
 
01:44:59.950 --> 01:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
for interrupting do you know of any
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
other states that have done this kind of
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
phone number conservation
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
successfully I believe it's in place all
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
over the country yes our our position
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
and coming here today was simply to
 
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that we don't have the nhta
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
members operate in very rural areas and
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ability to implement
 
01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
some of these steps so we just want to
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
clarify that this that that is a a
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary not a mandatory process as
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
written uh we could Envision a time down
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
the road where a a mandatory
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
implementation of this may result in the
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
entire block of numbers from a rural
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
carrier being taken back so it's simply
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh cleaning up the language okay great
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative lii has one uh thank you
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
question in a block are the numbers
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
consecutive or can they the block be a
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
numbers in a block of a
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
thousand um they are I believe that
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
they're consecutive I'm not as familiar
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
with that because we don't participate
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
in it um but they're definitely they're
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
sequential yes yep and I believe each
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
carrier is given a thousand numbers at a
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
time followup followup uh so there's no
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
form of what in computers we called
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
garbage collection where um uh the
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
computer would find unused files and in
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
this case find unused phone numbers
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
phone number that hasn't been assigned
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
and um recycle
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
them that's a very good question and I'm
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
not because we haven't been involved in
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
thousands of block pooling we've asked
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
the same question because there is
 
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.030 align:start position:0%
the same question because there is
porting

01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
porting
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
where a customer of a landline company
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
May Port their number to a wireless
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
company and we've always asked that
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
question is when somebody takes that and
 
01:47:04.589 --> 01:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
Associates it with their wireless
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
service and then disconnects that
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
service how does that number make its
 
01:47:11.589 --> 01:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
way back to the original carrier and
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
we're we're just not familiar enough
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's not as widespread as an issue for
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
us okay thanks for giving us your
 
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
perspective now let's hear from Karen
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
CTI and I don't remember what that
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
us oh goodness good morning Mr chair
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
Karen Susi I work at shanin Capital
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
group and I'm here representing CTI
 
01:47:49.589 --> 01:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
we'll just call it the wireless
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
Association so your T-Mobile's AT&amp;T
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
Verizon US Cellular sorry I spoke away
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
from the microphone um and and we we are
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
um we definitely appreciate uh the
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
meaning of the 603 area code the brand
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
the identity that it brings to residents
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire I think
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
what we need to consider though is how
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's being done and it's being done
 
01:48:20.109 --> 01:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
through a fee or a new tax to the
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
carriers in order to implement to bring
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
it fruition and I think that's something
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we definitely need to consider
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
certainly especially when there's
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
already $30 million each year brought in
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
from the commun communication Services
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
tax that's put into the general fund so
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't have a clear number
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
of what the uh fee or tax would be that
 
01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
causes us angst um we're not sure if
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's a one-time assessment we're not
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
sure if it's something that will
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
continue on can they keep coming coming
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
at us when there are other issues that
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
they need to investigate or
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
establish so again we do understand
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm a granite stator been here
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
my whole life my grandparents my great
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
parents grandparents have been here I
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
understand um but again we need to think
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
about how we're doing this and possibly
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
I would suggest find this alternative
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
funding source and use
 
01:49:20.109 --> 01:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
it okay questions for Miss Susi uh
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you thank you for
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
sure I understand your point here so are
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
you saying that the carriers will have
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
to spend money actually implementing uh
 
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
this procedure and therefore that would
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
get passed on to their customers so it's
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the department is
 
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there be this fact or
 
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me fee or tax to essentially hire
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
a consultant to investigate how to
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
implement this we haven't been given a
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
specific number it could vary um we're
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's going to be Equitable
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
or not to all carriers um and of course
 
01:50:07.870 --> 01:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly sure there is the
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
possibility that that could be a pass
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
customers so
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
your assessment here is
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
that the state is already collecting $30
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
million worth of communication tax from
 
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:30.270 align:start position:0%
million worth of communication tax from
your

01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
members which gets passed along to rate
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
payers and then this is another cost
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
that would get passed along to rate
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
payers correct because the fiscal note
 
01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
says that such costs would be paid
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
through a special utility assessment on
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
all providers of telecommunication
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
services so you're seeing this as just
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
an increase in taxes that are going to
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
be paid by rate payers correct yes
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you representative
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
N I think you've just already answered
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
my question so thank you oh okay thank
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Let's uh
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
let's go way back in time I remember
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
this issue came up when I was on the
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
commission and uh I believe it was like
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
15 years ago or something when it was
 
01:51:21.870 --> 01:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
you know saved the 603 was the calling
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
card for this movement and I don't even
 
01:51:27.629 --> 01:51:27.639 align:start position:0%
remember what we did but I I think back
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
then you had to get blocks of 10,000 was
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
the minimum amount of numbers you can
 
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
buy and that was changed so at least for
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct in my memory about 15
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
years we've been able to keep all
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
telephone numbers in New Hampshire is
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
603 what is what what isn't working now
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we can continue to do that that we
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
need a new program and a new
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
assessment you know I I did look briefly
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
back at that I think there's an effort
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
in 2000 and possibly 2010 or 11 uh to do
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
something to conserve the area code uh
 
01:52:02.229 --> 01:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
the only thing I could figure out was
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
that they did not use an assessment or a
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
tax or fee to do so um you have more
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
experience with that than I do and
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
fortunately all right thank you I don't
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
remember a tax of fee being associated
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
with either but I could be wrong thank
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
you additional questions for Miss Susi
 
01:52:18.599 --> 01:52:20.109 align:start position:0%
you additional questions for Miss Susi
representative

01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair uh um so
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the looking at the fiscal
 
01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
note uh it talks about $100,000 to
 
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
$300,000 cost in the fiscal year 25 26
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
period so it looks like a one-time cost
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh if this approach has been used in
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
multiple other states
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
already why cannot we just pick up
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
what's been learned there and not have
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
to pay this it doesn't make any sense do
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
you understand why we need this this
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
costing I I do not understand why we
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
need this I think that's a question for
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
the Department again if there's a cost
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to be associated with doing
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
this I would strongly urge people to
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
look to that communication Services tax
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
which is already being taken in would
 
01:53:13.109 --> 01:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require the dup excuse me the
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
duplicative efforts of the department to
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none and hers being the last pink
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
card I have on this uh to testify on
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill I would like to ask the
 
01:53:35.069 --> 01:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
department if they would be willing to
 
01:53:37.470 --> 01:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
come up and ask answer a couple of
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions for us thank you for uh
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
volunteering to do that I appreciate it
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
yes and apologies I did fill out a pink
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
card it perhaps got lost along the way
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
so my apologies for that but we're happy
 
01:53:54.430 --> 01:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
to to be here answer your lost somewhere
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
and provide
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
information it
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
was same the same bill was referenced
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
both times that's why we
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
had two testimonies for 595 and none for
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
this oh okay so I guess you forgot you
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
wrote the wrong bill number on the early
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
morning error on my part my apologies
 
01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.350 align:start position:0%
morning error on my part my apologies
you're

01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.510 --> 01:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
forgiven well good morning um we're
 
01:54:24.430 --> 01:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
happy to be here and talk about Senate
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 603 um I think you all all heard
 
01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
about how 603 is an iconic New Hampshire
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
symbol AS New Hampshire residents were
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
all familiar with the branding and the
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
importance of our 603 area code on our
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
local economy um it is we are one of a
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
handful of single area code states
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
remaining in the country um our
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Maine are also a single
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
area code State and while we've been
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
very successful with past efforts that
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
you heard representative Harrington talk
 
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
about excuse me in 2000 when we
 
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
implemented thousand block pooling and
 
01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.629 align:start position:0%
implemented thousand block pooling and
in

01:55:04.629 --> 01:55:04.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
2011 um we find ourselves being notified
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
by Nampa which is the North American
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
numbering plan administrator who
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
oversees the
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
administration and the numbering
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
resources for the country that our area
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
code will exhaust in the the second
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
2027 looking to our neighbors in Maine
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
they were in a similar position in
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
2021 um they had a projection of areic
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
cod exhaust in uh
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
2024 and they undertook a number of
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
steps that we've looked at we've
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
Incorporated many of those same steps um
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
and they were able to push their area
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
code exhaust out 10 years to 2034
 
01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
whether we'd have the same success or
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
not um we don't know our our
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
demographics and economic makeup are a
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
little bit different but we're very
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we can push out with um
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
efforts the life of the 603 area code
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
for some time to come um perhaps enough
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
time for the federal government to
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
determine how to number across the whole
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
country as we these numbers it's a
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
finite resource they'll dwindle and a
 
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
new plan a new numbering plan for the
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
whole country will come into place some
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
point down the
 
01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.390 align:start position:0%
point down the
road

01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
20ish years 25 years is the projection
 
01:56:34.750 --> 01:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
so we'd like to keep our single area
 
01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:37.719 align:start position:0%
code for as long as we can and uh be a
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
part of um the the robust New Hampshire
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
economy that comes from that there are
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
some questions about thousand block
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
pooling and what rate Center
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
consolidation was that Mr Rand addressed
 
01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to be clear
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
that the North American numbering plan
 
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
administrator or Nampa holds the numbers
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
for all states and assigns blocks of
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
numbers that's the Thousand block or a
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
code which is a
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
10,000 pool of numbers um out to
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
Providers since the early 2000s um with
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
the exception of some of the small rural
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
carriers like Granite State Telecom um
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
Bretton Woods Dunbarton Telecom all
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire have obtained
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
their numbers in blocks of 1,000 um
 
01:57:37.069 --> 01:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
prior to that they were getting their
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
numbers in blocks of 10,000 and many of
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
them still hold those 10,000 number
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
blocks and there are likely numbers in
 
01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
there that are not being used that could
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
be um made available
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
for other residents to use other
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
businesses to use in the state of New
 
01:57:58.750 --> 01:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and help increase the
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
available um available numbers what this
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
bill does
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
is in essence it it it it closes a
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
loophole so to speak so the department
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
today has the obligation to preserve
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
numbering resources in the 603 area code
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
and we have the authority
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
to um assess ass utilities those that we
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
regulate for the cost of any Consultants
 
01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
that we hire in this instance the
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
utilities those that we regulate the
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
incumbent local exchange carriers the
 
01:58:34.679 --> 01:58:36.270 align:start position:0%
incumbent local exchange carriers the
landline

01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
landline
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
providers um they're not the only ones
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
using numbers and so it seems Equitable
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
that all use all providers that use
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
telephone numbers in New Hampshire
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
should contribute to um the cost of this
 
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.550 align:start position:0%
should contribute to um the cost of this
consultant

01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the department would hire for this
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
investigation um we've issued an RFP we
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
have some bid responses in I'm pleased
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
to say that those responses are in the
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
range of the fiscal note so for um a
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
three-year uh a contract the cost would
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
be relatively minimal spread across all
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
the service providers that use numbers
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
into the Hampshire um the Department's
 
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:23.639 align:start position:0%
proposal um at this point is to use uh
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
publicly available reports that identify
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
how many blocks those are the Thousand
 
01:59:32.669 --> 01:59:32.679 align:start position:0%
number blocks how many numbering
 
01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
resources a provider has and allocate
 
01:59:40.030 --> 01:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of the consultant's contract
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
based on that so it' be a very minimal
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
charge over three years to any of these
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
providers it is a
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
one-time Project Specific assessment
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a tax it's not a ongoing fee um
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's a special assessment for the cost
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
project yes I'm trying to think if I
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
answered all the questions that came up
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
to this point but please go ahead I
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
didn't realize you were finished I'm
 
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Bernardi has a
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so I guess
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is the same question I asked
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
Miss Susie uh you know if Maine has
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
already done this and other states have
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
already done this why can't we learn
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
from them without so high a consultant
 
02:00:37.870 --> 02:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
cost sure well we'll certainly be
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
looking to what um other states have
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
done or considering doing um with the
 
02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
reorganization of the Public Utilities
 
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
Commission and the creation of the
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
Department of energy in 2021 there was
 
02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.629 align:start position:0%
Department of energy in 2021 there was
um

02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:56.589 --> 02:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the the group that
 
02:00:59.149 --> 02:00:59.159 align:start position:0%
worked on telecommunications issues and
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
so this consultant would replace that
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
industry knowledge and provide a much
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
needed resource to us as we move through
 
02:01:08.639 --> 02:01:12.069 align:start position:0%
needed resource to us as we move through
these

02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
processes so on line 26 of the bill it
 
02:01:17.790 --> 02:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
says that the department May specially
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
assess these providers for the costs of
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
Investigations and other other Pursuit
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
other proceedings pursuant to
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
Etc how would the department feel if we
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
change that language to require the
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
department to
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
obtain uh funds from the fiscal
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee to cover those
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
costs in other words use general fund re
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
revenues rather than assessments to
 
02:01:45.679 --> 02:01:49.350 align:start position:0%
revenues rather than assessments to
telephone

02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
providers I certainly think that's a
 
02:01:54.109 --> 02:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
policy decision for you all to make and
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
whichever path you believe is more
 
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate we're happy to
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
follow and what do you think of the
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion that was made
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
earlier that this pooling of thousand
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
block numbers be made voluntary rather
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
than mandatory yes thank you I knew
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
there was a point that I had missed and
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
that was Mr rand's comment about um the
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh that he was
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
referencing Ing we did see some language
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire telephone
 
02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
Association that would have added in
 
02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.109 align:start position:0%
Association that would have added in
that

02:02:29.109 --> 02:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
um for for service providers that have
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
chosen to participate in Thousand block
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
pooling that in New Hampshire is only
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
the rural teleone companies all the
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
other companies do participate in
 
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
Thousand block pooling so we're
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely fine with that as Mr Rand
 
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out the service area their their
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
survey um aren't aren't
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
the big Urban centers where there's huge
 
02:03:00.189 --> 02:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
demand for a lot of numbers um they have
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
their blocks of numbers their their
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
10,000 code to serve their customers and
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
communities okay let's go first with
 
02:03:12.679 --> 02:03:13.990 align:start position:0%
communities okay let's go first with
representative

02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington um yeah just so I get clear
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um at right now the
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
the tax is being paid only by the uh
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
incumbent landline operators and not
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
like cell phones and so
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
forth so there is no tax okay right so
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
we have our uh utility General
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
assessment yeah under RSA
 
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
363a which uh tele regulated telephone
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
companies uh pay into um based on 33% of
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
their revenues other utilities pay based
 
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
on 100% of their revenues but because
 
02:03:55.549 --> 02:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
telephone companies are only lightly
 
02:03:57.629 --> 02:03:57.639 align:start position:0%
regulated their their assessment is a
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
little bit lower but this there is no
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
such assessment okay on um uh certain vo
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
providers um or on uh cellular providers
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
right so they're not paying anything for
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
our our general uh work on Telephone
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
numbering which is constant as as you
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
may remember right um
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
this would be like a consultant fee that
 
02:04:26.549 --> 02:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
would be specially assessed that's under
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
a different section of the statute
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
whenever we uh have a proceeding and we
 
02:04:33.629 --> 02:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
need to hire some sort of expertise or
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
even a stenographer those costs are uh
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
specially assessed to the utilities
 
02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
involved right um this would extend that
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
special assessment to cell phone
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
providers just for this contract right
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
the the the landline telephone company
 
02:04:54.549 --> 02:04:54.559 align:start position:0%
compies are already paying right um this
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
would just add them and sort of close
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
the loop so that the the payment
 
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism is fair and it's it really is
 
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
quite minimal uh
 
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
followup yes um okay just in general I
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
mean we've been fighting this battle now
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years um I make a lot of
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
phone calls to people that live in New
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that don't have a 603 area
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
code my daughter lives in Massachusetts
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
she has a 603 area code maybe it's just
 
02:05:22.549 --> 02:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
time we said because you have to punch
 
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
in 603 now it's not like it was a couple
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
of years ago uh so it maybe it's just
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
time we say enough give it up and uh you
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
know stop chasing the the goal that
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose on eventually
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
because eventually we're going to run
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
out of numbers and just say you know we
 
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
we kept it 603 as long as we could time
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
to say uh you know State's too big to
 
02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
comments the governor wouldn't be happy
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
with that uh
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
idea you don't have to uh answer that
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
question since it's a policy issue
 
02:05:57.800 --> 02:05:59.310 align:start position:0%
question since it's a policy issue
representative

02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I mean actually this is a
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
probably the same question I'm just
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to word it slightly differently I
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
understand the iconic value of having a
 
02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
603 area code and the cultural
 
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
significance and you know what it means
 
02:06:13.069 --> 02:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
to people but you mentioned an economic
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
benefit of having the 603 area code or
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a single area code can you
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
elucidate what that economic benefit
 
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.589 --> 02:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
so I think as you all most likely have
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
seen there's a number of businesses that
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
market themselves with 603 in the name
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
of their business that there's
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
merchandise there's mugs there's
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
t-shirts there's sweatshirts you name it
 
02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
that proudly Proclaim
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
603 um to put a price tag on it would be
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
challenging um the Department of
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs is
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
undertaking a survey to businesses in
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
the state to get their thoughts on this
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
and we expect to have a report on that
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
from them in June um but he don't
 
02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
currently have that
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
information certainly it would
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um in your
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
testimony you mentioned the
 
02:07:16.030 --> 02:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the person hired to
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
investigate and accomplish this task uh
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
and yet in the fiscal note um there's it
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
says does this bill authorize new
 
02:07:26.430 --> 02:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
positions to implement this bill and and
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
no is checked so what is it would you
 
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
would you need to hire an additional
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
person to for this bill or not thank you
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
there would be no additional staff
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
permanent full-time staff at the
 
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy we issued an RFP
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
for a consultant to perform that work
 
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
and to assist the existing staff at the
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
department in these actions followup
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
followup um and you also just mentioned
 
02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
about the The Branding and the marketing
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
of 603 would a company still be able to
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
use 603 as a branding option even though
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
we had more than one uh ZIP code uh not
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
code so I don't know that I'm the best
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
qualified person to to answer what their
 
02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
marketing strategy might be if we had a
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
second area code and and where they
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
felt value was in continuing to use that
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
603 Brands representative licki uh thank
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
question actually I've got two questions
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh one easy one is is nanpa go back to
 
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
the days of Mel and are still doing the
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:51.149 --> 02:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
then I'm not familiar with what Nampa
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
did one in the days of marel I confess
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
um but the North American numbering plan
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
administrator has been around since 1947
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
when the whole numbering structure okay
 
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
was um adopted there have been huge
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
technological changes since then and NAA
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
has had to keep up with that and adopted
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
strategies as has the FCC okay and the
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
second one I've got the document here
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I know that it's not from you but
 
02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
and I know that it's not from you but
from

02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
necta saying that there are by my
 
02:09:24.549 --> 02:09:24.559 align:start position:0%
addition they have approximately a
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
million customers in New Hampshire since
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
we have 10 million possible numbers that
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
means they're running at 10% efficiency
 
02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
agree so de
 
02:09:38.119 --> 02:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
agree so de
is

02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
not ubiquitous that's the wrong word
 
02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
necta lines is not representative of all
 
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
the lines that are used in the ham it's
 
02:09:55.470 --> 02:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
only for the residents and businesses
 
02:09:56.910 --> 02:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
that choose to
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
use their companies services so they
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
represent Comcast for example or comcast
 
02:10:07.390 --> 02:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
is part of necta for example
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
um if you're not a Comcast customer
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.549 --> 02:10:17.559 align:start position:0%
count okay let's try to wrap this up
 
02:10:19.990 --> 02:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative rolds you get the last
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman just a
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
quick question here do you have any
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
sense of how many or like the percentage
 
02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:31.599 align:start position:0%
of 603 numbers are fax numbers and with
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
this um effort involved trying to sort
 
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
of recover those you know it's kind of a
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat still used but um almost bygone
 
02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
technology now uh that's a great
 
02:10:46.109 --> 02:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
question fax numbers and paging numbers
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
are um certainly numbers that are no
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
longer uh really used
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
and but yet they're still assigned to
 
02:10:57.069 --> 02:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
those carriers and so that's part of
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
this effort to reclaim those numbers is
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
to get those blocks of numbers back um
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
and I I do understand from our friends
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
in Maine that that um it that effort
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
alone extended the life of their area
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
code by at least two to three
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
years so great question all right well
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here I'm
 
02:11:20.549 --> 02:11:20.559 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
house uh Senate Bill
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
603 and because we're so far behind I'm
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to quickly open the public hearing
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
386 and ask Senator avard to uh
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill to
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
us thank you for being here and waiting
 
02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
patiently Senator I know you're a busy
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
that so the floor is yours thank you sir
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman hopefully this is
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
um in my second term I was uh told that
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be the chair of
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
energy and I remember walking into that
 
02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
everybody and I did a Maya Copa I had no
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
clue about energy period nothing
 
02:12:19.629 --> 02:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
zilch and now that I've uh been a few
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
years uh engaged with this particular
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's like growing up in a
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
house where everybody's speaking French
 
02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
you understand it but you can't speak
 
02:12:33.669 --> 02:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
it and uh I'm pretty much at that stage
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh I understand when people are coming
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and they they have some complex uh
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
issues and uh so um but one of the
 
02:12:42.669 --> 02:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
things that I did that that first year
 
02:12:44.549 --> 02:12:44.559 align:start position:0%
is I put in a bill was it was a study
 
02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill and it had to do with uh
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
transmission generation and
 
02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:52.280 align:start position:0%
distribution and so
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
I uh I learned that now there's a thing
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
called storage and so what I did is i i
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
i revamped this this old study and uh
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
and I added storage to it now why did I
 
02:13:06.990 --> 02:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
do that well in my committee there are
 
02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
three individuals that have never sat on
 
02:13:10.990 --> 02:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
energy and uh I don't know if you know
 
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
Belo well I was very smart man and this
 
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
is a compliment to to Cliff a very smart
 
02:13:26.910 --> 02:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
man however as he was going through uh
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
topics as though just about everybody in
 
02:13:30.030 --> 02:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
the committee understood what he was
 
02:13:32.669 --> 02:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
saying uh I could see uh individuals
 
02:13:35.229 --> 02:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
wanting to uh choose to listen to a
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
board being scratched with finger nails
 
02:13:39.310 --> 02:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
then then because they had no idea what
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
he was talking about um I could grasp
 
02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
some of the things Senator Waters was
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
there and by between the both of us we
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
could uh we could glean what Cliff was
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
saying and we definitely appreciate his
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
input uh no SL on him but what uh what I
 
02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
I I saw was that there was a a lack of
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge and as our you
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
know our legislature changes from year
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
to year and the changes in energy
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's a new department or whether
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
there's new phrases or new new things
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
going on I thought it was a good idea to
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh to put in another study committee and
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's really what this is it's it's a
 
02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
study committee and hopefully I'll chair
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
it and uh if you uh
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
if the speaker seems uh
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
wise has has a an inclination as to who
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
who could benefit from this I think uh
 
02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
great and let the Departments come in
 
02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
and share the new technologies new
 
02:14:36.910 --> 02:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
information and uh get people up to
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
speed what what are the changes because
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
in four years A lot has changed and so
 
02:14:43.870 --> 02:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
this is just uh you know something that
 
02:14:46.069 --> 02:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
is bipartisan and it'll help everybody
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
get an understanding uh what's happened
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
what what's changed uh you know where
 
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
does the power come from what are the
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
big fat power lines what are the little
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
ones what's distribution what is uh
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
generation and now what is storage and
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh so it'll it'll investigate those
 
02:15:03.350 --> 02:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
things and hopefully we can come out
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
with uh some uh some useful information
 
02:15:10.549 --> 02:15:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
legislature okay thank you so I served
 
02:15:16.669 --> 02:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
on that study committee as you will no
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
doubt recall oh and we amassed a huge
 
02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
amount of information
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
about generation transmission and
 
02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
distribution we didn't do storage
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
obviously but I'm
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
wondering is it necessary to go over all
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
that ground again why not just do a
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
study on
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
storage uh if if the committee seems
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
that that's where they want to go that's
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
fine I do think though that there are
 
02:15:43.870 --> 02:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
newbies that are that come in that could
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
possibly benefit from uh including the
 
02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
interns when they come in uh if I have a
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
new assistant I asked them to to go back
 
02:15:54.910 --> 02:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
to that old report and read it uh so
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
that they can uh come up to speed to
 
02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:00.559 align:start position:0%
what's going on in in energy and uh it's
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
up to you I mean I I I think it would be
 
02:16:04.109 --> 02:16:04.119 align:start position:0%
beneficial but it wouldn't hurt my
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
feelings if you just kept it the storage
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
but that's up to you okay additional
 
02:16:11.709 --> 02:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative Corman thank
 
02:16:13.549 --> 02:16:13.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you again
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
Senator aart uh just a very simple
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
question uh I see that the bill says
 
02:16:20.270 --> 02:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
that the committee reports its findings
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
by November 1st 2024 but I don't see
 
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
anything about uh repealing the
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee so um is this committee
 
02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
intended to continue beyond November 1st
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.389 --> 02:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
you okay additional questions
 
02:16:39.399 --> 02:16:41.190 align:start position:0%
you okay additional questions
representative

02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh I'm
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
just wondering whether it wouldn't be
 
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
more efficient to Simply have the
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
department of energy prepare a report
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
I mean those are the people who are
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be experts here and then any
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
intern or whoever you would want to get
 
02:17:00.429 --> 02:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
up to speed could simply read that
 
02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
report yeah I I think there's something
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
unique about a study committee though uh
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
especially when I run it I'm good at it
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
and U I think you can draw out certain
 
02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
things and have different departments
 
02:17:15.629 --> 02:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
and if there might be uh industries that
 
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
want to come in and testify about you
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
know say you just did storage you know
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
we can have a host of individuals come
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
in and and talk about that um I'm not
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
going to waste anybody's time when it
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
comes to doing a a study committee I
 
02:17:30.719 --> 02:17:34.230 align:start position:0%
comes to doing a a study committee I
generate

02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.389 --> 02:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
results representative Ms has a question
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Senator over here oh
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
there you are hey how are you
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
um um why why
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't um if if the if the idea is to
 
02:17:52.589 --> 02:17:52.599 align:start position:0%
is to educate um members of the senate
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee and this committee why
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't um people just be invited to
 
02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
come in for a hearing and and share the
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
information that they have I mean if you
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
as the chair of the Senate energy
 
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
committee invited industry to come in
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
and talk about storage I'm sure that you
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
would have a room full of people and
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
that would be accomplish what I think is
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
the objective of educating people it's
 
02:18:17.709 --> 02:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
partly but there is something unique
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
about having a study committee and
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
having a final report and what what we
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
can do with that is we can uh it keeps
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
the narrative going as to far whatever
 
02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
whatever's coming up whatever we we
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
we've develop and uh future legislation
 
02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh fixes in legislation it's uh it's a
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
it's Unique to have a study committee uh
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
and there are some advantages that I
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
think that I've I've seen over the years
 
02:18:45.870 --> 02:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
as a direct result of that uh things
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
that you haven't thought of yeah
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
somebody can present something to you
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's great but uh as somebody comes in
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
and testifies you can come back and and
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
we can explore something maybe in a
 
02:18:56.349 --> 02:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
different avenue that we hadn't thought
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
about before uh thinking outside the box
 
02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
so I uh I do like study committees I I
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
really don't think they're a waste of
 
02:19:06.309 --> 02:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
time and uh and I don't think it's also
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
redundant I do think that uh in in
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
addition to that when you're engaging
 
02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
people into questioning coming back a
 
02:19:12.319 --> 02:19:13.549 align:start position:0%
people into questioning coming back a
few

02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
few
 
02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
times they're engaged in the process and
 
02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
they learn a little bit more uh other
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
than just sitting listening to a lecture
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas has a question thank
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
question um again kind of a similar
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
question but I'll just reoriented I know
 
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic really messed up our
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
process here and we have not recovered
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
fully yet but I know that in the past we
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
used to have um presentations from
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
various departments here for the express
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
purpose of getting our new people up to
 
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
speed on what was going on to me that
 
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
seems like a more
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
continuous uh renewal of in of of
 
02:19:58.990 --> 02:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
information every every two years versus
 
02:20:01.030 --> 02:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
a study committee which could present a
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
stagnant report uh would couldn't you
 
02:20:06.990 --> 02:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
see that as being if we got back to that
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
process again being a more continuous
 
02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
and more up toate method of of uh
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
informing our our new
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
people you know when I uh when I brought
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
in that study
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh a few years back
 
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
I remember walking into the room into
 
02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:24.910 align:start position:0%
I remember walking into the room into
the

02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
house and I a particular state
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative said I'm not going to
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
teach him anything I remember hearing
 
02:20:35.550 --> 02:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
her say that she became a very good
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
friend after that and even we're on the
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
opposite sides of the aisle and I really
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
gleaned from that and I gleaned because
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
she had kind of the same attitude but
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
she was huge in in helping us out with
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know with with information
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
and they brought in some type of
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan thing that went on there and
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
I I I can't explain it and that's why
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here again I think uh working with
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
her uh I uh we actually did a signing in
 
02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
front of the governor and I made sure
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
that she she got her recognition because
 
02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
she was very very important to the study
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
she was an institution as far as I was
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
concern and I learned a lot from her but
 
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that others can do the same
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
thing and it was it was it was almost
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
the same kind of objections but I think
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
we we drew Drew out some good things
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
from from the study so I um I'm I'm
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty
 
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh not adamant but I think it's a really
 
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
good idea to have a study yeah if you
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't mind representative McGee has a
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah my question is on the
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
timing of the bill it says at the end
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
where the report is going to come out
 
02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
and it gives a November 1 date but it
 
02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
also says
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee should be formed 45
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
days after passage right so that could
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
be June so you end up in July and you're
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the summer and it's election year and
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying the report is going to be
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
due not even four full months later
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
which would mean you'd have maybe a
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
month per topic so do you think it's an
 
02:22:10.990 --> 02:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
adequate amount of timing for you to run
 
02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
a process like this I think if you
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
narrowed the scope of it yeah maybe if
 
02:22:17.070 --> 02:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
you just if you just uh brought it down
 
02:22:21.389 --> 02:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
to uh storage sure yeah
 
02:22:23.469 --> 02:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank further questions it's a it's
 
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
a huge topic no doubt and uh I think uh
 
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of people you know they they hear
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
things and they nod their heads but I
 
02:22:33.469 --> 02:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
guarantee you about 70% of the
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
information that comes before committees
 
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes people are like I'm really not
 
02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
sure what he said but I'm nodding my
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
head it's it can be confusing you know
 
02:22:43.389 --> 02:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
and uh and I just want people to be up
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
to speed but uh the Chairman's uh
 
02:22:47.230 --> 02:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion maybe just storage I'd be
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
all right Senator seeing no further
 
02:22:54.270 --> 02:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you and having
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
no further pink cards on this bill I'm
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
02:23:01.710 --> 02:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 396 thank you everybody and
 
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%

hearing on Senate Bill 449 and call
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%

Senator Waters to introduce the
 
02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters to introduce the
legislation

02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh Senator avard will
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 449 relative to
 
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
permit the permit issuance timeline for
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
State air
 
02:23:34.429 --> 02:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
permits Senator we appreciate it thank
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
you very much and for the record I'm
 
02:23:37.269 --> 02:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Kevin avard filling in for
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters because I really respect
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
him a lot I like him uh and so here uh
 
02:23:47.269 --> 02:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh SB 449 relative to permit issuance
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
timeline for state permits this bill
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
provides the Comm commissioner 180 days
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
to act upon air uh Pollution Control
 
02:23:55.600 --> 02:24:01.349 align:start position:0%
to act upon air uh Pollution Control
permits

02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
applications that's about it that's
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
about it
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay so replaces with a reasonable
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
period of time with 180 days basically
 
02:24:13.070 --> 02:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
it I uh I I think that's about it I
 
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared to do this but just so
 
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
that uh you folks can okay I get it
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and I'm not sure you're
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to be able to answer this but um
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
on lines four and five this would apply
 
02:24:34.590 --> 02:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
to all sources except affected sources
 
02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what what that means
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
except effective effective sources I
 
02:24:41.070 --> 02:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
would I would defer to to Senator waters
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
on that thank you the department will be
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
testifying in a moment so they can
 
02:24:48.910 --> 02:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
answer that question yes representative
 
02:24:50.910 --> 02:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just answer that
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
question effective sources means uh
 
02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
sources that are covered under the
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
federal Clean Air Act so I'm assuming
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe we'll get some more
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
information on this that it
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
is anything that doesn't burn anything
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
or emit anything that would be covered
 
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
under the clean era so if you had solar
 
02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
or wind uh as compared to uh natural gas
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
Uh Wood coal nuclear power because
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear power has permits clean air
 
02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
permits as well so I think we'd be
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
limited to those as well as storage
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
chairman okay so the department was
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
gonna oh here we go so the department
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
will testify
 
02:25:35.550 --> 02:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
next thank you
 
02:25:38.110 --> 02:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
Senator thought you were leaving uh on
 
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
us Craig and Mr Wright and maybe some
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
others will testify for the Department
 
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
yes I have a a couple of guys that are
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
much smarter than me out in the hallway
 
02:25:50.429 --> 02:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
but I don't see them right now but
 
02:25:53.309 --> 02:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
anyways um thank you uh I'll just start
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
off by saying again Craig Wright I serve
 
02:25:57.550 --> 02:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
as the air director for the Department
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and also with
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
me today is Todd Moore who just walked
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
in the door who's in our air permit
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
program and also Gary Milbury I think Mr
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
Milbury will join me up here in a second
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
just a couple of high level comments on
 
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
the bill uh first of all Senate Bill 449
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
is at the request of Dees to deal with
 
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
differing timelines between RSA 125c and
 
02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
r a
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
541a so I think as you all remember air
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
permitting is one of the division's most
 
02:26:28.349 --> 02:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
important functions uh not only under
 
02:26:28.359 --> 02:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
important functions uh not only under
RSA

02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
125c but also the federal Clean Air Act
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
um we take that job very seriously and I
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
think we have an excellent track record
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
of working with industry on our air
 
02:26:40.359 --> 02:26:41.309 align:start position:0%
of working with industry on our air
permit

02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
permit
 
02:26:43.389 --> 02:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
program um one of the fundamental
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
tenants we need though is sufficient
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
time to work on air permits uh to review
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
an air permit application and engage
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
with app an uh the EPA and the public is
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
extremely important to us to us to
 
02:26:57.630 --> 02:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
ensure the integrity and transparen of
 
02:27:00.269 --> 02:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
the program and with that I was going to
 
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Gary I think we have a
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony letter and Todd could we hand
 
02:27:15.389 --> 02:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
out sorry we're usually a little more
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
coordinated than this um this is our
 
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
fault because we're so far behind Okay
 
02:27:26.030 --> 02:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
so the most important thing is um I
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
think this bill we think would give the
 
02:27:31.230 --> 02:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
department sufficient time to process
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
our air permit
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
applications um and recognizing that
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
you're so far behind maybe we'll just
 
02:27:38.670 --> 02:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
keep our testimony to that at this point
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
I know you're going to hear from the Bia
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have been working with Bia on this
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill um I if they have some concerns I
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
would just like to express to the
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee that we've been working with
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
them and we would certainly be willing
 
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
to continue to work with them um in
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
terms of finding a place where
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's comfortable with this okay
 
02:27:59.469 --> 02:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
and with that I think we'll just turn it
 
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
over to questions I think you get the
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
gist of what we're talking about yes I
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
think so so questions for vice chair
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
thanks foring my question really really
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
quick can in the past what was the
 
02:28:17.469 --> 02:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time and was that
 
02:28:20.190 --> 02:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
longer than 180 days is that where're
 
02:28:22.510 --> 02:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
making the
 
02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
change in in some cases uh it it ranged
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
up to uh I believe nine months for uh a
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
significant modification to an operating
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
permit I believe that was the longest
 
02:28:41.309 --> 02:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so following
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
up on Vice chair Thomas's question so
 
02:28:52.870 --> 02:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
the department is actually okay with
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
putting itself under this time pressure
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
that it didn't have before this is the
 
02:29:01.389 --> 02:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
Department's idea put put put the put us
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
on the clock so essentially what happens
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
because the way RSA 125 is currently
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
written it says a reasonable time period
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't specify a time period
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 541
 
02:29:16.429 --> 02:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
a29 kicks in and that gives us 60 days
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
which is totally unworkable for us so
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
we've come up with what we believe to be
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
a reasonable time period including you
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
got to realize we have to do we have to
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
do a completeness review of the air
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
permit application we have to do a
 
02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
technical review of the air permit
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
application we have to draft the permit
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
and then we also need to go through a
 
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
public notice and public hearing
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity so if you back calculate all
 
02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
those chunks of times that's
 
02:29:46.230 --> 02:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
approximately how we came up with 180
 
02:29:49.230 --> 02:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
days okay before I call on other
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions I just want want to give
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters an update Senator while
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
you were out Senator avard introduced
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and you are certainly most
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
welcome to testify if you so desire but
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
um since he already introduced the bill
 
02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
to okay okay thank you sir uh now we'll
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
move along representative Kaplan first
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming in today this might be
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
the question other people also have
 
02:30:28.750 --> 02:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
could you clarify what type of uh what
 
02:30:30.750 --> 02:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
type of installations this deadline
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
would affect are we talking Title Five
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
applicants are we
 
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
talking uh the uh the amendment that the
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh senate committee approved at their uh
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
at their initial hearing um was
 
02:30:47.469 --> 02:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
specifically added to address Title Five
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
permits which are really those time
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
frames are more dictated by the federal
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
Clean Air Act and EPA so uh this bill
 
02:30:59.309 --> 02:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
would would apply to basically all other
 
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
operating uh representative
 
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking a question just a follow
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
up on that the effective sources means
 
02:31:14.990 --> 02:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know covered under the Clean Air Act
 
02:31:17.269 --> 02:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
but this is a Air Pollution Control
 
02:31:19.389 --> 02:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
permit so there must be some type of
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
source that's not covered under the air
 
02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
um the Clean Air Act but also requires
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
an air pollution control permit from
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
Dees what would those be for
 
02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
example uh so we essentially have um
 
02:31:34.830 --> 02:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
your affected sources which are defined
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the laws uh sources subject to the
 
02:31:38.830 --> 02:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
title 5 permitting
 
02:31:41.309 --> 02:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
program that uh like I said EPA
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
essentially dictates time frames under
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
that program so this this would cover uh
 
02:31:49.030 --> 02:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
basically your non-affected sources
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
these are generally your smaller sources
 
02:31:55.389 --> 02:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
that uh might have a uh a heating system
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
like a like a large boiler uh maybe like
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
a hospital or um you know smaller
 
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
commercial facilities so we're generally
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
talking um fuel burning devices or small
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
companies that like manufacturing
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
companies that may emit uh uh regulated
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
toxics uh that are covered under 125i
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent ative muns has
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
you for coming in and taking my question
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
um so what is it about um these specific
 
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
permits that's so different than the uh
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
applications and permits that are
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
considered that are covered by uh RSA
 
02:32:42.670 --> 02:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
541 where where the requirement is to
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
have a uh an answer within 60 days so uh
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
when when that bill was passed I believe
 
02:32:53.309 --> 02:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
in the 2018 session that essentially
 
02:32:56.110 --> 02:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
unless specifically Exempted applied to
 
02:32:58.510 --> 02:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
any type of environmental or any type of
 
02:33:00.670 --> 02:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
permit that was issued including any
 
02:33:02.349 --> 02:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
permits issued by
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
Dees um and as director Wright mentioned
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
the the issue with the 60 days is that
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh even before we get into any real
 
02:33:12.319 --> 02:33:13.469 align:start position:0%
uh even before we get into any real
detailed

02:33:13.469 --> 02:33:13.479 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
02:33:16.750 --> 02:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
review um the process requires that once
 
02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
we do complete a review we go out to
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
public notice uh some programs may you
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
know if there's a permit of
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
interest uh you know certain programs
 
02:33:31.269 --> 02:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
may require say a butter
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
notification uh this is air pollution so
 
02:33:36.190 --> 02:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's a little unique and therefore under
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
our programs we need to provide public
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
notice uh at in a Statewide newspaper
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
which would be the union leader and then
 
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:45.630 align:start position:0%
which would be the union leader and then
we

02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:33:48.269 --> 02:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
also uh provide a public notice in a
 
02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
local paper uh as close to the applicant
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
town as we
 
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
can as you know there are challenges
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
with newspapers either closing or
 
02:34:02.830 --> 02:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
reducing to going to a weekly so uh
 
02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
anyways those notices have have to uh be
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
for a minimum of 30 days once we figure
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the planning it takes lead times to
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
get it into newspapers and such you're
 
02:34:17.630 --> 02:34:17.640 align:start position:0%
essentially at 40 days and we haven't I
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
haven't mentioned any work that we've
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
actually done Rev doing the application
 
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
so it essentially gave
 
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
us regardless of you know uh you know
 
02:34:30.349 --> 02:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
the uh level of activity and or number
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
of applications coming in regardless of
 
02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:33.910 align:start position:0%
of applications coming in regardless of
the

02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:36.269 --> 02:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
complexity we essentially had that
 
02:34:38.910 --> 02:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
60-day time frame to review every one of
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
those applications and get out to
 
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
notice um if somebody requests a hearing
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
we have to go out for an additional
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
30-day notice so that's that's what made
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
the 60 days unworkable for the air
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
permit program and that's where we've
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
asked for uh you know for a uh the 180
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
day time frame um and then we We There
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
is a provision where we can work with
 
02:35:07.230 --> 02:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
applicants uh and uh request more time
 
02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
if something does need more time so that
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
we can do our role in protecting public
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
health and and do a thorough review of
 
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
the application follow followup followup
 
02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:20.910 align:start position:0%
the application follow followup followup
so

02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
um unless the process for Air permits is
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
dramatically different than other
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
permits covered by RSA
 
02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
541 what you're describing to me would
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
suggest that the that the limits in 541
 
02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
need to be changed that they're
 
02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
unrealistic I I don't want to speak for
 
02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
other programs there might be some
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
programs where that don't have those
 
02:35:47.710 --> 02:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
types of uh public comment periods that
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
we may have um the requirements may be
 
02:35:52.349 --> 02:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
simpler so there there may be
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for other permits uh that
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
can be processed in that amount of time
 
02:35:58.510 --> 02:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
I will point out a couple things that
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
the air division has done specific to
 
02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:01.630 align:start position:0%
the air division has done specific to
air

02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
air
 
02:36:04.150 --> 02:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
permitting um where we have reduced
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
turnaround times one of those is we've
 
02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
established a general permit for sources
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
that are installing backup generators
 
02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
for backup power uh we have an online
 
02:36:18.269 --> 02:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
registration uh where the permit is
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
established every 5 years
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
and instead of going out and going
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
through the typical
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
process we've set up what's called the
 
02:36:28.349 --> 02:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
general permit where facilities that
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
have backup engines can uh actually
 
02:36:33.309 --> 02:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
register those engines and obtain their
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
permit through an online process and
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
we've reduced that where uh generally a
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
permit can be issued anywhere from you
 
02:36:43.389 --> 02:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
know a couple days to a couple weeks
 
02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
turnaround time that's one and we've
 
02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
also got a permit by notification
 
02:36:50.990 --> 02:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
program for uh sand and gravel sources
 
02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
for Rock crushing and screening
 
02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
equipment where it's a online
 
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
registration and uh portable crushing
 
02:37:01.469 --> 02:37:01.479 align:start position:0%
plants uh can also use the online system
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
to notify us uh if they're moving to a
 
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
new location so if complaints are
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
received we can follow up at that
 
02:37:10.070 --> 02:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
address so we those are a couple
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
examples where we've been able to look
 
02:37:14.349 --> 02:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
at certain types of very simple types of
 
02:37:17.070 --> 02:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
permits and Implement a a permitting
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
system that is uh where 60 days would
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
would work for that but um this the 541a
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
my un 29 my understanding is that that
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
would cover uh different types of uh
 
02:37:34.190 --> 02:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
permit programs within the department
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
some that might be an appropriate limit
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
but um at Le for at a minimum for the
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
traditional air permitting programs it's
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
just not workable so I
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
I um my experience I I I'd hate to go
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
out and say
 
02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
UH 60 days doesn't work for anything
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
there might be programs where it does I
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
apologize for long-winded response but I
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
wanted a couple examples
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
followup than thank you just one one
 
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
quick followup is is some of the um the
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
pressure that you feel to get these done
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
within the time frame is that is that
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
because of some resource constraints
 
02:38:13.309 --> 02:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
where you you don't have the staff you
 
02:38:15.870 --> 02:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the the the technology
 
02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:18.110 align:start position:0%
don't have the the the technology
infrastructure

02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
Etc I love always ask for more resources
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
for uh you know to increase timeliness
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
of Permitting um I think I think we try
 
02:38:30.269 --> 02:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
to uh you know balance the resources we
 
02:38:33.389 --> 02:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
try to balance uh shifts and economic
 
02:38:36.670 --> 02:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
activity uh for example April is a month
 
02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
where we tend to receive a lot of
 
02:38:40.590 --> 02:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
applications for construction uh
 
02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes the late winter months as well
 
02:38:44.070 --> 02:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
so that they can go through the process
 
02:38:46.389 --> 02:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
and have their permit to uh do the
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
construction during the Spring and
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.349 --> 02:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
yeah you the only thing I would add
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
about resources is is the entire
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
permitting program is paid by the
 
02:39:04.110 --> 02:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
applicants the regulated Community they
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
pay the fees that run the program so if
 
02:39:08.230 --> 02:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
I wanted more resources I would need to
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
raise those fees and I don't think that
 
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
environment okay additional questions
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington um yeah sort
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
of like the thing that's not mentioned
 
02:39:23.750 --> 02:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
here we have the 100 not to exceed 180
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
days for everything except for Effective
 
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
sources which we've established as there
 
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
covered under the Clean Air Act what's
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
the time limit on those apparently
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
there's none I mean could be five years
 
02:39:37.469 --> 02:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
10 years or up to a year
 
02:39:37.479 --> 02:39:38.990 align:start position:0%
10 years or up to a year
right

02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
excuse do in some cases it's could be up
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
that covers different tyes of
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
per this is Todd speaking work
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
Gary so there are some time frames I
 
02:40:05.269 --> 02:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
know one year for title Ral for initial
 
02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
permit 18
 
02:40:11.469 --> 02:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
NSR so it varies I guess my question
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
would be since we're changing the law to
 
02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
address the time frame shouldn't we
 
02:40:22.510 --> 02:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
include something for quote affected
 
02:40:25.630 --> 02:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
sources whether that's if 180 days is
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is not sufficient
 
02:40:29.269 --> 02:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
because of all the federal hoopla I
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
understand that but maybe 365 days is
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
days or something so there's a limit on
 
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
it thank you both of those references in
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
the statute refer to 40 CFR part 70 and
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
there are timelines specified in that
 
02:40:45.910 --> 02:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
section and one of them is nine months
 
02:40:47.309 --> 02:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
and one of them is longer than nine
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
months they're at the federal level so
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
change okay further questions
 
02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:57.870 align:start position:0%
change okay further questions
representative

02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
Kennedy yeah I think you partly answered
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
this but when I look at the Senate
 
02:41:04.910 --> 02:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a lot of concern by
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
small businesses that basically 180 days
 
02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
is too long and I get the feeling that
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
someone at Dees said well if the if the
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
application is simple or small then will
 
02:41:18.030 --> 02:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
work faster so I don't know if that's
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
comforting enough for them or whether
 
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
something specific needs to be try to
 
02:41:24.469 --> 02:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
put into the
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill so we have had ongoing discussions
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
with Bia I don't want to characterize
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
those totally today other than they have
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
expressed some concerns about the one
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
siiz fits-all with the 180 days um so
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's something we're certainly willing
 
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
to have ongoing discussions with E A
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or a work session or and
 
02:41:44.269 --> 02:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
with Bia of
 
02:41:48.269 --> 02:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
course well the text on line five says
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
within a re reasonable period of time
 
02:41:54.429 --> 02:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
and does not exceed 180 days so that
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
would make me to believe that it could
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
be done in fewer than 180 days is that
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
not true that that's correct chair
 
02:42:07.230 --> 02:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh tradition so I I will also kind of
 
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
break air permits that we're talking
 
02:42:11.389 --> 02:42:11.399 align:start position:0%
about today into kind of two categories
 
02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
there are permits for like a a new new
 
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
installation or modification to
 
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
equipment at a existing permited
 
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
facility we those are considered our top
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
priority in terms of how uh how quickly
 
02:42:27.070 --> 02:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
they come in in the
 
02:42:28.990 --> 02:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
prioritization and then you have
 
02:42:32.510 --> 02:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
operating permits that uh that the
 
02:42:34.150 --> 02:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
source ultimately gets after a
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
construction permit and those are good
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
for a 5year period And when those come
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
up for Renewal uh there are Provisions
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
in air permit programs uh basically
 
02:42:47.309 --> 02:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
every state in EPA programs uh have a
 
02:42:49.950 --> 02:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
provision called application Shield
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
where if your permit is up for Renewal
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
if you file a timely application um the
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
sources we're talking about today if you
 
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
file a renewal 90 days before the
 
02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
expiration date of your permit you keep
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
operating under the terms and conditions
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
of your permit until we can take action
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
on those renewals so in general what
 
02:43:13.070 --> 02:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
happens and this may speak to some of
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
the questions we got uh you know when
 
02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
when when we're prioritizing
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
applications for processing your new
 
02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
construction and modification
 
02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
applications get the highest
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
priority um we generally try to get
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
those complete um our our goal is is 120
 
02:43:32.640 --> 02:43:33.550 align:start position:0%
those complete um our our goal is is 120
days

02:43:33.550 --> 02:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:35.389 align:start position:0%
days
max

02:43:35.389 --> 02:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
max
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
um so we we we do have an internal goal
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
to uh focus on those and then what ends
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
up happening is if there is a resource
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
issue or uh all of a sudden there's a
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
lot of uh economic activity where we're
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of requests to build
 
02:43:54.309 --> 02:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
something um those renewals will
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately get pushed off a little bit
 
02:43:59.790 --> 02:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
so that we make sure we meet our goals
 
02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
applications okay excellent
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Ros has a question yes
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
again one pretty quick I hope uh I know
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
you won't have exact numbers but um how
 
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
many permits of the type that are
 
02:44:19.550 --> 02:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
contemplated by this bill uh are in
 
02:44:21.550 --> 02:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
existence now how many permits are out
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
there you know how many sources and then
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
how many new ones um do you see each
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
year just ballpark uh well just uh I'll
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
separate out the the the one the backup
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
generators that I mentioned uh that they
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
can register online we have over 400 of
 
02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
those um Todd would you say other than
 
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
the affected we have about 35 affected
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
sources that we're exempting or
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
proposing to have not covered on of this
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
that leaves us uh is it about
 
02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.710 align:start position:0%
that leaves us uh is it about
350

02:44:55.710 --> 02:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
350
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
sources looking at some of the
 
02:44:59.550 --> 02:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
information the program put together
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
about 60 applications on the new
 
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
construction significant Amendment which
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
concerned and then on top of that we're
 
02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
doing renals
 
02:45:21.790 --> 02:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
that Shield so the applicant is not
 
02:45:23.950 --> 02:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
waiting for the decision to change their
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
operations so 60 of the ones that the
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
applicant is really concerned about and
 
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
then in addition to that we
 
02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
do sure how many more RS and then all
 
02:45:39.469 --> 02:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
thetive not
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
cover I I believe we get somewhere
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
around is it safe to say we get around
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
maybe 120 to30 applications a
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
year uh and and uh like Todd said about
 
02:45:53.309 --> 02:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
60 of those are ones that we would be
 
02:45:55.710 --> 02:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
placing a higher priority on and then
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
the balance uh we would work into
 
02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:01.349 align:start position:0%
the balance uh we would work into
our

02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
processing uh
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
schedule representative lewicki has a
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you Mr chairman
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question what
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
triggers the need for an a permit um is
 
02:46:16.269 --> 02:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
it some level of uh emissions or is it
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
02:46:20.429 --> 02:46:20.439 align:start position:0%
know sure cuz you know my home generator
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be no uh in general you we we
 
02:46:25.389 --> 02:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
don't permit
 
02:46:28.190 --> 02:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
residential uh residences at all it it's
 
02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
essentially your commercial
 
02:46:33.309 --> 02:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
institutional industrial facilities that
 
02:46:35.990 --> 02:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh require an air permit so uh an
 
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh require an air permit so uh an
example

02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
um uh if you uh have a say a a boiler or
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
furnace That's
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
rated um over over uh
 
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
that that burns natural gas or number
 
02:46:54.910 --> 02:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
two oil that's over 10 million BTUs per
 
02:46:57.469 --> 02:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
hour which is a rating on the furnace
 
02:46:59.710 --> 02:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
that requires an air permit just for
 
02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
reference the one you have in your home
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
is probably around 100,000 BTUs per hour
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
um mine at home is like 90 I've seen
 
02:47:09.150 --> 02:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
them up to
 
02:47:12.110 --> 02:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
125,000 so uh the boilers that are
 
02:47:14.309 --> 02:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
running on like essentially home heating
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
oil or natural gas or propane uh they
 
02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be uh over 10 million BTUs
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
so roughly 100 times bigger uh and then
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
we have um and then if there were C like
 
02:47:28.590 --> 02:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
if it if it operates on wood because of
 
02:47:31.110 --> 02:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
the emissions a permit's needed if it's
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
over 2 million BTUs per hour still about
 
02:47:35.790 --> 02:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
20 times bigger than your typical
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
furnace uh we uh diesel engines that are
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
for non-emergency
 
02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
purpose uh some uh uh wood process
 
02:47:47.309 --> 02:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
processing industry you know Sawmills
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
and such uh uh use generators uh uh for
 
02:47:55.710 --> 02:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
for uh Prime power uh to operate their
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
facilities um you'll see uh you know
 
02:48:01.830 --> 02:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
places like uh most of your hospitals
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
have air permits for their heating
 
02:48:07.630 --> 02:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
systems um uh St Paul's School in
 
02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
conquered another you know larger
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
facility that would would require a
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
permit so uh so engines and boilers for
 
02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
fuel burning devices and then
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities
 
02:48:21.389 --> 02:48:21.399 align:start position:0%
um they're subject to the state air
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
toxics law so that's kind of a chemical
 
02:48:27.349 --> 02:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
by chemical review to see if a permit's
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
needed um uh fuel storage
 
02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:33.230 align:start position:0%
needed um uh fuel storage
facilities

02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
um uh incineration units um for
 
02:48:41.230 --> 02:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
municipal waste um most of your larger
 
02:48:43.950 --> 02:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
landfills because they require uh
 
02:48:45.790 --> 02:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
landfill gas control systems to be
 
02:48:47.469 --> 02:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
installed and
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
managed um those are those are a number
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
of examples of the types of facilities
 
02:48:54.750 --> 02:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
that our our our power plants around the
 
02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:59.309 align:start position:0%
that our our our power plants around the
state

02:48:59.309 --> 02:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:59.319 --> 02:49:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:04.429 --> 02:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for the
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
Department I want to thank you three
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for being here today to help
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
us understand this bill we have one more
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
pink card and we're going to hear next
 
02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
from the business and industry
 
02:49:17.590 --> 02:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
Association and ksten kooch is going to
 
02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislation good
 
02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
morning and welcome nice to see you
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
again good morning chairman Vose members
 
02:49:32.590 --> 02:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee it's still morning
 
02:49:35.150 --> 02:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
right um I'll be brief I know it's been
 
02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
a long morning um for the record my name
 
02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
is Kirsten kotch I'm the vice president
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
of public policy for the business and
 
02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
industry Association we serve as uh New
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Statewide Chamber of Commerce
 
02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
known as Bia uh firstly I'd like to
 
02:49:48.239 --> 02:49:49.150 align:start position:0%
known as Bia uh firstly I'd like to
recognize

02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
02:49:51.110 --> 02:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
um that the Department of Environmental
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
Services has been exceptionally
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
cooperative and has been having ongoing
 
02:49:57.070 --> 02:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
discussions with Bia staff and members
 
02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
about the need for this change um biia
 
02:50:02.429 --> 02:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
fully recognizes as and is in support of
 
02:50:04.229 --> 02:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
the Department's need for this change um
 
02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
we understand that there needs to be a
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
more realistic permit application
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
timeline as well as the need to
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
reconcile the conflicting statutes um
 
02:50:14.550 --> 02:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
however B is opposed to Senate Bill 449
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
as currently
 
02:50:17.870 --> 02:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
drafted the bill provides the
 
02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner 100 80 days to act upon an
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
air pollution control permit application
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
this is three times longer than the
 
02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
current timeline of 60 days um this
 
02:50:28.710 --> 02:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
drastic change in timeline and the
 
02:50:30.670 --> 02:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
Optics are especially concerning for our
 
02:50:32.590 --> 02:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
members that are new and small
 
02:50:35.790 --> 02:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
businesses um their
 
02:50:40.229 --> 02:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
operations um hinge on the timely
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
approval of permits um as many of you
 
02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
already know it has long been a priority
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the Bia to advocate for streamlining
 
02:50:49.229 --> 02:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
Expediting the regulatory
 
02:50:51.790 --> 02:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
process um we believe the larger problem
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
that this bill attempts to address is
 
02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
that the state has enacted an ambitious
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory agenda um while the
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
department is challenged by a lack of
 
02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
resources necessary to administer and
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
keep up with these changes the recurring
 
02:51:05.950 --> 02:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
solution for this problem seems to be
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
giving the state agencies more time to
 
02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
make permitting decisions um however
 
02:51:11.710 --> 02:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
this solution is not a financially
 
02:51:13.349 --> 02:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable practice for business and
 
02:51:16.030 --> 02:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
industry business's success relies on
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory reliability and
 
02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
predictability undue delay on projects
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
unfairly burdens Property Owners
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
developers ultimately killing projects
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
because in many cases the state has not
 
02:51:29.150 --> 02:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
yet committed the necessary resources
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the agencies to in a reasonable time
 
02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:33.950 align:start position:0%
for the agencies to in a reasonable time
frame

02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
frame
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry um administer the statutes
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
and rules it's adopted um while the perv
 
02:51:42.070 --> 02:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
while it is the purview of the state
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislator to decide how aggressively it
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
wants to regulate regulate Environmental
 
02:51:48.309 --> 02:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
Protection the amount of funding it
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
wants to devote to it we ask please not
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
to shift the burden of untimely
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
decisions onto the businesses and
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
Property Owners um we do have a few
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations um we believe that if
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
state agencies cannot meet the deadline
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
and statute then applicant should
 
02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
receive the default approvals as
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA 541 829 um we see this
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
as a guarantee for accountability on the
 
02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
dep part of the department although
 
02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's not our preference we'd rather
 
02:52:17.229 --> 02:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
they get the correct approval um to
 
02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
further improve this bill be our
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
preference to work with the Department
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
to draft an amendment to establish dual
 
02:52:25.229 --> 02:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
tracks for air permit timelines um so
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
whereas more complex permits would have
 
02:52:29.750 --> 02:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
longer timelines less complex permits
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
would have shorter timelines moreover we
 
02:52:33.630 --> 02:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
believe that there needs to be um
 
02:52:35.550 --> 02:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
protections for new and small businesses
 
02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
whose viability relies on these timely
 
02:52:39.830 --> 02:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
permitting um decisions I know the
 
02:52:42.510 --> 02:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
department has made comments about um
 
02:52:44.269 --> 02:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
you know prioritizing new and small
 
02:52:46.429 --> 02:52:46.439 align:start position:0%
businesses and and we appreciate that
 
02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
and and we do believe that will happen
 
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
but we'd like to see that enshrined in
 
02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
statute to guarantee that that um stays
 
02:52:56.910 --> 02:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
a practice going forward and finally um
 
02:52:58.910 --> 02:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
because this bill proposes a lengthy
 
02:53:00.429 --> 02:53:00.439 align:start position:0%
extension and timeline we'd like to see
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
the extensions beyond the established
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
timelines removed um in conclusion um
 
02:53:07.469 --> 02:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
it's important to us that any changes
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
made to this bill would be realistic and
 
02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
workable for both industry and the
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
department um we respectfully request
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
the committee allow more time for
 
02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
industry and the department to work
 
02:53:18.110 --> 02:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
together on crafting an amendment so
 
02:53:20.429 --> 02:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
that's bill um that is necessary can
 
02:53:22.710 --> 02:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
pass um with the right compromises going
 
02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
forward thank you I'd be happy to answer
 
02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:25.910 align:start position:0%
forward thank you I'd be happy to answer
any

02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:53:28.830 --> 02:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you appreciate your
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
input on this legislation questions from
 
02:53:34.269 --> 02:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
Miss K representative Corman thank you
 
02:53:36.269 --> 02:53:36.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Miss KO for
 
02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I I understand the
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of of the Dual tracks I'm
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
wondering is it really feasible to
 
02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
establish in statute the actual criteria
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the Dual tracks thank you for the
 
02:53:53.309 --> 02:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
question um that's something we've been
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
discussing with the department and I
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
think um our engineers and our
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
membership are reviewing as well um it's
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
something we like to work on going
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
forward with the
 
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
Department follow up yeah I'm just
 
02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
wondering does it make more sense to
 
02:54:10.389 --> 02:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
have it as a rul making rather than in
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
statute um thank you for the question I
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
think that's probably a decision for the
 
02:54:15.550 --> 02:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
decide representative Kennedy has a
 
02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
decide representative Kennedy has a
question

02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman it's just
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
very similar I mean I guess you are not
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
totally comforted by we will do it
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
faster so you do have a plan for
 
02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
adjusting the bill and um you know I I I
 
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
had the same thought as uh
 
02:54:35.550 --> 02:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative Corman that maybe that
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:40.830 --> 02:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
rule okay uh further questions
 
02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:42.030 align:start position:0%
rule okay uh further questions
representative

02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:54:43.910 --> 02:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
Harrington and thank you Mr chairman
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
first one what's going on now have a
 
02:54:52.190 --> 02:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
60-day limmit they want an extension for
 
02:54:54.269 --> 02:54:54.279 align:start position:0%
tripling that amount of time so I assume
 
02:54:56.510 --> 02:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
most permits aren't issued within 60
 
02:54:58.750 --> 02:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
days I think it thank you for the
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
question um so I think first there's a
 
02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
problem with conflicting statute there's
 
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
one statute that says this needs to be
 
02:55:06.269 --> 02:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
done in a reasonable amount of time and
 
02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
there's one statute that says this needs
 
02:55:10.790 --> 02:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
to be done in 60 days and I it's my
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that most of these permits
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
or at least the more complex ones cannot
 
02:55:16.830 --> 02:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
be done in 60 days
 
02:55:19.510 --> 02:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
followup followup now you've listed a
 
02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
different a number of things here uh is
 
02:55:25.070 --> 02:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
Bia prepared to give something that
 
02:55:26.990 --> 02:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
could be implemented this session or are
 
02:55:29.070 --> 02:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
you basically saying let's put this on
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
hold get back with the department and
 
02:55:33.630 --> 02:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
come up with some way to implement these
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
proposals that will isn't going to be
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
able to be done in the next few weeks is
 
02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
that accurate statement uh thank you for
 
02:55:42.670 --> 02:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
the question uh we're prepared to work
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
on Amendment with the Department this
 
02:55:46.990 --> 02:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
week I mean it's something that we can
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're already discussing we can do this
 
02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
right away um so we'd like to have an
 
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
amendment ready for the committee very
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
soon all right thank you uh
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a
 
02:56:00.910 --> 02:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
question that was B thank you Mr chair
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
that was basically my question but I
 
02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
guess I ask you did you run out of time
 
02:56:05.910 --> 02:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
when in your discussions with the
 
02:56:07.550 --> 02:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
Department is that why you need extra
 
02:56:09.630 --> 02:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
time in order to do this thank you for
 
02:56:11.550 --> 02:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
the question um you know I think this
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
bill when it was in the Senate it flew
 
02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
through the committee it was voted on
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
the same day that um the public hearing
 
02:56:19.349 --> 02:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
was immediately after and so we thought
 
02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
there may be an opportunity to do
 
02:56:21.950 --> 02:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
something like this in the Senate
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there just wasn't the time
 
02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:56:28.910 --> 02:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
it representative Ms has a question
 
02:56:30.750 --> 02:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank thank you
 
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
for coming in and I I I want to thank
 
02:56:35.229 --> 02:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
you for um highlighting the fact that a
 
02:56:37.389 --> 02:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
lack of resources is at least a part of
 
02:56:40.429 --> 02:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
the problem um because I think that is
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
um an important
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
consideration um and and the the only
 
02:56:47.790 --> 02:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
thing that I I guess I would ask is that
 
02:56:50.229 --> 02:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
um if you're working with the Department
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
on a um an amendment which is wonderful
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
um give some please give some
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
consideration to how do we how we
 
02:57:02.790 --> 02:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
address that resource um uh constraint
 
02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
um including how we pay for it thank you
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you additional comments
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
02:57:12.070 --> 02:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Miss kooch for
 
02:57:15.429 --> 02:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
being here today um I just want to note
 
02:57:16.750 --> 02:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
that we already heard that on the other
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
side of the wall there's a lot of pretty
 
02:57:20.190 --> 02:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
fa is there so maybe they didn't have
 
02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
any questions for you but we do um in
 
02:57:26.229 --> 02:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony from the um from the
 
02:57:28.349 --> 02:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services uh
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
air division air quality division they
 
02:57:33.710 --> 02:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of the statutory
 
02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that they're required to
 
02:57:39.630 --> 02:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
meet in order to process some of these
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
complex or new applications including
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
application completeness a technical
 
02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
review public notice um all of which
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
take Literal time
 
02:57:51.309 --> 02:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
and then you know crafting and issuing
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
the permits so I agree that there may be
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
resource issues in terms of there being
 
02:58:00.790 --> 02:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
a a choke point that only certain people
 
02:58:05.229 --> 02:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
are doing that work but um I I still am
 
02:58:05.239 --> 02:58:06.469 align:start position:0%
are doing that work but um I I still am
not

02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:58:10.910 --> 02:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
sure uh I'm not sure about the
 
02:58:12.590 --> 02:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there aren't
 
02:58:14.910 --> 02:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances under which a six-month
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
period would be needed for a particular
 
02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
permit and that they might be able to
 
02:58:19.880 --> 02:58:21.150 align:start position:0%
permit and that they might be able to
decide

02:58:21.150 --> 02:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
decide
 
02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
that um thank you for that I don't think
 
02:58:25.830 --> 02:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we dispute that there are some
 
02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
cases where there's more time needed um
 
02:58:30.910 --> 02:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
especially on very complex projects and
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
when they need to do the public
 
02:58:34.750 --> 02:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
notification requirements um our goal
 
02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
here is to come up with a timeline
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable for both industry and
 
02:58:39.309 --> 02:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
the department and we don't want to
 
02:58:41.070 --> 02:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
suggest anything that creates a
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
condition that they can't work
 
02:58:44.750 --> 02:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
under thank
 
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
you additional questions from Miss KO
 
02:58:52.150 --> 02:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you very
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
much for um giv giving us your
 
02:58:57.269 --> 02:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation and I'll
 
02:58:59.790 --> 02:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
look forward to hearing how Amendment
 
02:59:03.870 --> 02:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
negotiations go thank you with an idea
 
02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
toward there being extremely
 
02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
timely it's possible that we may exec
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
this bill a week from today Monday the
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
22nd of April so I'll just throw that
 
02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
out there in case that helps uh move
 
02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:19.790 align:start position:0%
out there in case that helps uh move
things

02:59:19.790 --> 02:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:59:23.429 --> 02:59:23.439 align:start position:0%
along okay um with that we're going to
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on Senate Bill
 
02:59:30.990 --> 02:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
449 and we will now take an extended
 
02:59:33.710 --> 02:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
lunch break I know some of our

amendment so the last thing that the or
 
05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing that the amendment does
 
05:09:12.000 --> 05:09:12.708 align:start position:0%
the other thing that the amendment does
is

05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
it adds the text by rule or order in two
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
places uh under RSA 362 F colon 2

15a This is
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%

05:09:44.390 --> 05:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
boiler boilers for their qualification
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
for Rex and uh the department realized
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
after that legislation was passed that
 
05:09:53.590 --> 05:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
they really needed this extra text and
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
so they've asked asked us to include
 
05:10:00.150 --> 05:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
that and the uh Amendment does just that
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll see if there's any um
 
05:10:05.390 --> 05:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
comments that anyone has to make about
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%

rule or order so can you just tell me
 
05:10:24.150 --> 05:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
what the order it who the order would
 
05:10:26.670 --> 05:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
come from is that an executive
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
order no that is a department of energy
 
05:10:32.910 --> 05:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
order so if there is a
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding within the department of
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
energy that makes some kind of a
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%

that
 
05:15:14.670 --> 05:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
myself go ahead okay so what this
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it adds three key
 
05:15:20.190 --> 05:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
things to the original bill on line
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
three uh excuse me line five it adds
 
05:15:26.750 --> 05:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
text that says within 60 days of the
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section the
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
department of energy shall open a
 
05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
proceeding so that the text within 60
 
05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
days of the effective date of this
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
session is
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
starting uh Midway through line
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
nine and going down to Midway through
 
05:15:50.548 --> 05:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
line 12 there's new text that says the
 
05:15:51.750 --> 05:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
department shall provide the
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
chairpersons of the house science
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee and the
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
Senate energy and natural resources
 
05:15:59.788 --> 05:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
committee with status updates regarding
 
05:16:01.948 --> 05:16:01.958 align:start position:0%
the proceeding every six months after
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
opening the proceeding until rules are
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
adopted by the department so that's new
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
text and essentially that will allow our
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
committee and the senate in our
 
05:16:15.868 --> 05:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
committee to keep tabs on this
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
proceeding to make sure that it stays on
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
track and then the final new text is on
 
05:16:24.040 --> 05:16:25.110 align:start position:0%
track and then the final new text is on
line

05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
18 actually it starts at the very end of
 
05:16:28.000 --> 05:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
18 actually it starts at the very end of
line

05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
17 and it adds and shall be submitted to
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
the Joint legislative committee on
 
05:16:36.510 --> 05:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules within 15 months of
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this section so
 
05:16:41.948 --> 05:16:41.958 align:start position:0%
essentially what that says is that this
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
proceeding should not take any longer
 
05:16:47.070 --> 05:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
than 15 months it doesn't have to take
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
15 months but 15 months is the longest
 
05:16:54.910 --> 05:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
it should take so those are the uh
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
changes that the
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
amendment uh makes to the original
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
legislation anybody have comments on
 
05:17:04.868 --> 05:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
those changes are on the
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
amendment representative McGee thank you
 
05:17:10.470 --> 05:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah I'll just say that um
 
05:17:13.868 --> 05:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
you know the the need for rules and the
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
discussions around the issues that were
 
05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
having with interconnection in the state
 
05:17:21.510 --> 05:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
were totally uncontested in the in the
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearings um what was at issue was the
 
05:17:26.510 --> 05:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
time scale that people would have to be
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
facing um moving forward and that was
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
where there was you know push and pull
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
in terms of what could be delivered and
 
05:17:35.390 --> 05:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
what time frame and um you know how
 
05:17:36.910 --> 05:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
aggressive we could be in trying to at
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
least get the rules established so that
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
the interconnection cues could start to
 
05:17:45.270 --> 05:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
be um dealt with in a in
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
a um a more consistent way and and
 
05:17:50.910 --> 05:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully a shorter time frame so the
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we contended with
 
05:17:57.190 --> 05:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
was um when we would require the rules
 
05:18:00.590 --> 05:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
to be delivered and uh the negotiations
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
actually started at 18 months which um
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few people in the
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
queue who've been waiting quite a
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time now so we
 
05:18:11.670 --> 05:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to be mindful of what the
 
05:18:13.750 --> 05:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy felt they needed in
 
05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
terms of their resources and how they're
 
05:18:19.868 --> 05:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
approaching this rules process um and so
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
the compromise was made really you know
 
05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
they say the best compromises are
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
nobody's happy that is this bill or this
 
05:18:30.590 --> 05:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
amendment so that's that's all I have to
 
05:18:33.230 --> 05:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
say thank you additional comments
 
05:18:36.750 --> 05:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair um
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
well I while I think it's it's great
 
05:18:42.990 --> 05:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
that um there are some defined timelines
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
um identified um uh and that's a real
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
positive in in terms of this amendment
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
it it is disappointing that um the way
 
05:18:54.990 --> 05:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
the bill or the way the amendment is
 
05:18:58.510 --> 05:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
written doesn't really um take advantage
 
05:19:00.590 --> 05:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
of what hopefully has been a lot of
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
discussion and dialogue that's been
 
05:19:05.270 --> 05:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
going on around this issue uh the fact
 
05:19:08.070 --> 05:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the amendment is worded so that uh
 
05:19:11.470 --> 05:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
the proceeding will start 60 days after
 
05:19:14.990 --> 05:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the uh the bill um
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
it just seems like an artificial delay
 
05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
and um I would have liked to have seen a
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more urgency in um in moving
 
05:19:27.990 --> 05:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
things forward um hopefully um uh if we
 
05:19:30.270 --> 05:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
pass this today which I suspect we will
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully the department will take that
 
05:19:34.510 --> 05:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
as a sign that this is going to move
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
forward and they will start and they
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
will get started on on actually moving
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
this issue forward because it's a it's a
 
05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
major issue that that businesses and
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
homeowners across the state have uh
 
05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
Express concern about and we really need
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
to address
 
05:19:53.230 --> 05:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
it I agree that this is a significant
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
issue I do 100
 
05:19:57.628 --> 05:19:57.638 align:start position:0%
per. and you guys are going to think I'm
 
05:20:00.990 --> 05:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
weird for bringing this up but this
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
morning I actually looked at RSA 541a i'
 
05:20:07.510 --> 05:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
I've read it on numerous occasions in
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
the past but I hadn't looked at it for a
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
05:20:13.150 --> 05:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
years and I looked at it to kind of just
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory on just what is
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
involved in the process of drafting
 
05:20:20.110 --> 05:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
rules and among the things that I was
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
reminded of by
 
05:20:24.548 --> 05:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
reading uh RSA
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
541a is that before you start a rule
 
05:20:31.390 --> 05:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
proceeding you actually have to notify
 
05:20:33.510 --> 05:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
the public you have to put out a notice
 
05:20:36.350 --> 05:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
that you're going to start a rules
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding and it has to be 30 days I
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
believe or maybe even 60 days before the
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding begins and then once the
 
05:20:48.230 --> 05:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding once the the the drafting of
 
05:20:49.590 --> 05:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
rules has
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
begun uh and you have some rules to show
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
to people you actually have to have
 
05:20:58.150 --> 05:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
public comment periods and all of those
 
05:21:03.390 --> 05:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
public comment periods take time so to
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
restrict this proceeding any further
 
05:21:08.910 --> 05:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
than 15 months I think would be would
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
make it difficult for the Department to
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
complete the process according to the
 
05:21:18.190 --> 05:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:21:18.200 --> 05:21:20.350 align:start position:0%
um the
prescribed

05:21:20.350 --> 05:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
legislative procedure that's in the
 
05:21:25.788 --> 05:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act so I think
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
15 months is a reasonable amount of time
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
to give the department uh the time it
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
needs to do what it needs to do further
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
comment on either the amendment or the
 
05:21:38.750 --> 05:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill representative Corman thank thank
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
you uh it's actually a question on uh
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
the last sentence in both the original
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment any new employee
 
05:21:48.628 --> 05:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
positions required to implement this
 
05:21:51.510 --> 05:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be approved by the fiscal
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
Committee of the general court and I I
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
forget if we discussed this before does
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
that mean that the fiscal committee has
 
05:22:00.190 --> 05:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
no latitude and must approve them or is
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
it more that they're subject to
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
approval I personally believe it means
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
the latter
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
um but
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're you're preent in bringing that
 
05:22:17.910 --> 05:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
issue to the Forefront it is a it is an
 
05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
interesting question Mr shulock would
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
you like to um give us your opinion
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
about whether that
 
05:22:30.590 --> 05:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
sentence uh means that if the department
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
goes to the fiscal committee and says we
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
need another position they have to give
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
it to
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
you and could you come forward to
 
05:22:47.628 --> 05:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:50.910 --> 05:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
you I'll give you a lawyerly answer I
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if they're constitutionally
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
required to give it to us but I expect
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
that they would if they believe that we
 
05:22:56.280 --> 05:22:57.350 align:start position:0%
that they would if they believe that we
needed

05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
needed
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
it so basically you're saying if you
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
make a good case that you need that
 
05:23:03.628 --> 05:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
person then you'll probably get it well
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
there there is a reason why we keep
 
05:23:07.708 --> 05:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
arguing for more time to do this we we
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
are a resource constrained
 
05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
so okay that answer the question for you
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative Corman uh as well as
 
05:23:18.830 --> 05:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
possible okay further comment on this
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:23:23.628 --> 05:23:23.638 align:start position:0%

05:28:19.030 --> 05:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
second it now representative Harrington
 
05:28:22.230 --> 05:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
try this again um on page three of the
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment on line starting at line 30
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
All State agencies having permitting or
 
05:28:30.430 --> 05:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority shall make and
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
submit the committee a final decision on
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
parts of the application that relate to
 
05:28:34.750 --> 05:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
their permitting and other regulatory
 
05:28:37.150 --> 05:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
functions no later than 120 days after
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
the application's been accept it we just
 
05:28:40.590 --> 05:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
heard a bill this morning saying that
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
air permits weren't going to be required
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
for 180 days so it sounds like
 
05:28:46.990 --> 05:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
something's in Conflict here that's what
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
the dees said they needed to have so
 
05:28:52.230 --> 05:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
since air permits could be a part of
 
05:28:54.470 --> 05:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
something that uh is covered by this
 
05:28:57.948 --> 05:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill um we seem to have a conflict here
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
and this also says within 180 days of
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
the acceptance of the application the
 
05:29:03.070 --> 05:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee shall issue would deny a
 
05:29:06.030 --> 05:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
certificate for energy facility again if
 
05:29:07.868 --> 05:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
the air permit is going to take 180 days
 
05:29:09.910 --> 05:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
that see how the committee can finish it
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
on the same day that they get that now I
 
05:29:14.590 --> 05:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
realized there's a caveat at the end
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
that says something to the
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
effect um times for conducting public
 
05:29:20.310 --> 05:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
hearings ring a decision on the
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
application may be extended for good
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
cause upon written request of the
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
applicant it doesn't say anything about
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
the committee being able to extend that
 
05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
date so if we're going to have 180 days
 
05:29:32.548 --> 05:29:32.558 align:start position:0%
for ear permits we can't say you have to
 
05:29:34.830 --> 05:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
have them done in 120 days one of those
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
has got to
 
05:29:40.750 --> 05:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
give well I assume that this is
 
05:29:40.760 --> 05:29:42.910 align:start position:0%
give well I assume that this is
referring

05:29:42.910 --> 05:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
referring
 
05:29:45.670 --> 05:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
to the application before the site
 
05:29:48.190 --> 05:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee I have to differ
 
05:29:50.430 --> 05:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
All State agencies having permanent or
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
other regulatory Authority that includes
 
05:29:54.910 --> 05:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
Dees issuing an a
 
05:29:57.990 --> 05:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
permit yes I understand
 
05:30:02.590 --> 05:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
that but this particular legislation
 
05:30:04.910 --> 05:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
refers to the site evaluation
 
05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:12.628 --> 05:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
if my my memory
 
05:30:15.990 --> 05:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
serves elsewhere in the SEC legislation
 
05:30:17.788 --> 05:30:17.798 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the entire Statute in
 
05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
front of
 
05:30:24.548 --> 05:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
me it basically says that All State
 
05:30:27.390 --> 05:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
agencies uh having permitting or other
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority have to make and
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
submit to the
 
05:30:34.510 --> 05:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
committee a final decision on the parts
 
05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the application that relate to its
 
05:30:37.040 --> 05:30:40.948 align:start position:0%
of the application that relate to its
permitting

05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.868 --> 05:30:43.878 align:start position:0%
with a longer time frame this only
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:51.548 --> 05:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
legislation and so it does shorten the
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
time frame now will that conflict with
 
05:30:57.628 --> 05:30:57.638 align:start position:0%
the bill that we just passed earlier I
 
05:30:59.470 --> 05:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know the answer to
 
05:31:02.830 --> 05:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
that and there's nobody from Dees here
 
05:31:06.470 --> 05:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
who could shed any light on that
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
question Mr
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes um Dees was party to the discussions
 
05:31:15.150 --> 05:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
around the changes that would happen in
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
the FasTrack bill for the SEC process
 
05:31:20.150 --> 05:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
for existing facilities for that are
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
being repur repurposed and they did
 
05:31:27.628 --> 05:31:27.638 align:start position:0%
provide input on that um so I I think
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
that was part of the reason that the
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
language towards the end was listed that
 
05:31:33.310 --> 05:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
for a good reason in writing if you know
 
05:31:35.070 --> 05:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
somebody had to have a delay they could
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
but I think they are trying to hold to
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
um a tighter process because they think
 
05:31:45.270 --> 05:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
that it'll only be in exceptional cases
 
05:31:45.280 --> 05:31:47.030 align:start position:0%
that it'll only be in exceptional cases
where

05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the example that was given in our
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
meeting was that if we were looking at
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
converting to say a hydrogen um facility
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
you would need the Army Corps of
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
Engineers and they would not be able to
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
turn that around in a tight time frame
 
05:32:04.750 --> 05:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
because there's there's a you know
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
there's a um a base time limit that you
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
get with that particular interaction but
 
05:32:14.670 --> 05:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
in most cases they didn't think um that
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
the permiting time frame would be
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
elongated because in many cases the
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
plants would be um probably
 
05:32:27.910 --> 05:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
less of less concern in terms of the
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
technologies that they're turning
 
05:32:31.110 --> 05:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
towards um that was the only example
 
05:32:32.110 --> 05:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
they could really think of where it
 
05:32:35.390 --> 05:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
would probably be a more extensive uh
 
05:32:39.670 --> 05:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
effort in terms of the per in
 
05:32:39.680 --> 05:32:41.310 align:start position:0%
effort in terms of the per in
process

05:32:41.310 --> 05:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes I I think it's a good catch by
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and I wonder
 
05:32:47.390 --> 05:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
if Mr shulock if you would have any
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
comment on a potential conflict
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
between language in Cate Bill 449 which
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
we heard this earlier today that wants
 
05:33:04.190 --> 05:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
to give air PR emitting 180 days versus
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
the language here that wants to limit it
 
05:33:09.150 --> 05:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
to 120 days
 
05:33:11.310 --> 05:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm not familiar with the other bill
 
05:33:13.470 --> 05:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
I can say that for these facilities
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
there is an expectation that most of
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
them are not going to require air
 
05:33:21.830 --> 05:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
permits right that the for the most part
 
05:33:23.948 --> 05:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
the projects that are expected to be
 
05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
developed uh over the next several years
 
05:33:29.270 --> 05:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
will be renewable facilities right and
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
so that specific conflict shouldn't be a
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
problem but there should be language if
 
05:33:36.948 --> 05:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
I scribed everything and got everything
 
05:33:40.270 --> 05:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
in theil Emil to to folks correctly
 
05:33:42.190 --> 05:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
there should be Provisions that allow
 
05:33:46.430 --> 05:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
for an applicant to to extend the time
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
right so if if uh DS requires 30 more
 
05:33:52.430 --> 05:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
days in order to approve a permit then
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.360 --> 05:33:58.868 align:start position:0%
 
extension

05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
extension
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I believe we saw that uh
 
05:34:06.670 --> 05:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
language in the in the bill yeah so yeah
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
there there are plenty of opport unities
 
05:34:11.350 --> 05:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
to extend if if an applicant needs it
 
05:34:13.270 --> 05:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the SEC sighting wouldn't need to
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
fill the reason uh for allowing the
 
05:34:18.270 --> 05:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
applicant to request that extension is
 
05:34:21.310 --> 05:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
so that outside agencies don't feel the
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
need to deny a permit within that 180
 
05:34:26.390 --> 05:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
days just because they can't make it
 
05:34:28.590 --> 05:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
right so the or the 120 days what
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
whatever it is right so the the
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
applicant can simply ask for an
 
05:34:34.830 --> 05:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
additional amount of time so that their
 
05:34:38.070 --> 05:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
application doesn't fail before the SEC
 
05:34:40.230 --> 05:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Harrington
 
05:34:42.190 --> 05:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question not
 
05:34:45.310 --> 05:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
really that seems to be reverse logic uh
 
05:34:48.070 --> 05:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
couple of things first renewable covers
 
05:34:51.510 --> 05:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
wood so we could take a like we did
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in New Hampshire and we
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
converted a I think it was a coal plant
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
into a wood burning plant it would
 
05:34:58.270 --> 05:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
require a different air permit whole
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
different types of missions that would
 
05:35:02.548 --> 05:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
be renewable and that would require the
 
05:35:04.830 --> 05:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
air permit that we say they have 180
 
05:35:06.990 --> 05:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
days to give this says he got to do it
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
120 and I really don't think we want to
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
be in the position of of telling
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
applicants well you're going to be
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
denied the permit unless we can exceed
 
05:35:17.788 --> 05:35:17.798 align:start position:0%
the amount of time by law that we're
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to look at this because
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll just have to deny it
 
05:35:22.510 --> 05:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have enough time to do
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
it well if you don't have enough time to
 
05:35:25.390 --> 05:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
do it then you ought to improve the
 
05:35:27.548 --> 05:35:27.558 align:start position:0%
process or change the law but don't just
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
say well if you write a letter to us
 
05:35:31.708 --> 05:35:31.718 align:start position:0%
saying you're requesting an extension
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
even though you don't want an extension
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
because it's going to cost you a lot of
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
money uh but if you do that then we'll
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
keep working on it and maybe six months
 
05:35:40.350 --> 05:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
from now you'll get your permit but
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to just deny it
 
05:35:43.470 --> 05:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't make any sense putting
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
that in the law that that logic to me I
 
05:35:47.868 --> 05:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
think this needs more work if I may the
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
SEC wouldn't be the agency denying it
 
05:35:53.470 --> 05:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
would be Dees that would say we don't
 
05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
have enough time right so Dees asked for
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
the ability for the applicant to
 
05:36:02.990 --> 05:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
request um the extension without
 
05:36:05.868 --> 05:36:05.878 align:start position:0%
effectively without a denial right from
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
from the SEC so that the SEC process and
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
the dees process could continue in
 
05:36:14.590 --> 05:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
concert followup that would means why
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
even have a number in at all because if
 
05:36:20.548 --> 05:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
the dees decides well it's going to take
 
05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
six months for this permit because we're
 
05:36:24.030 --> 05:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
not going to around to it for a while so
 
05:36:26.110 --> 05:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
you can either have your permit denied
 
05:36:28.030 --> 05:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
or you can request the six months
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
extension it it becomes totally
 
05:36:32.110 --> 05:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
meaningless to put a a number in there
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
if the recourse of the applicant is to
 
05:36:36.430 --> 05:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
say oh well you're going to deny the
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
permit unless I agree to give you more
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
time then why even bother putting any
 
05:36:41.350 --> 05:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a deadline in because it's
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
totally meaningless I I just think this
 
05:36:44.590 --> 05:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
needs work it needs to be something
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.910 --> 05:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
fixed representative McGee yeah I was
 
05:36:52.750 --> 05:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
just going to say I think the reason
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a time frame in there is
 
05:36:55.708 --> 05:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
because all the parties that were there
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
discussing the bill were the intent of
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
the bill was to try and um create a
 
05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
process that would FastTrack repurposing
 
05:37:07.548 --> 05:37:07.558 align:start position:0%
of existing facilities that had already
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
already been cited by the evaluation
 
05:37:11.708 --> 05:37:11.718 align:start position:0%
committee so there would be exceptions
 
05:37:13.910 --> 05:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
if there were items that needed to be
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
permitted that were distinct from what
 
05:37:18.350 --> 05:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
was already at the facility site but the
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
idea of having a shortened time frame
 
05:37:22.590 --> 05:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
was really the intent of of having
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
something in legislature that would be a
 
05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
separate process from what we did in 609
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
so um I think that was kind of the
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
driving force which is why there's a
 
05:37:31.948 --> 05:37:31.958 align:start position:0%
number in there at least that would be
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
my explanation that why they're trying
 
05:37:36.830 --> 05:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
they were trying to quantify it in terms
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
of how long they wanted the process to
 
05:37:43.150 --> 05:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
be um sort of the standard process but
 
05:37:45.030 --> 05:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
then they had to allow for exceptions
 
05:37:46.430 --> 05:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want people to be
 
05:37:50.310 --> 05:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
turned away because uh of of a process
 
05:37:52.590 --> 05:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
that was outside of the norm but they
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted to define the norm as being
 
05:37:57.190 --> 05:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
short a short
 
05:37:59.510 --> 05:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
process well we could consider changing
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
the 120 days to 180 days but then we'd
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
have to change the 180 days on line 33
 
05:38:12.190 --> 05:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
to some um longer date like 210 days or
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
something would that be a potential
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
fix Mr shulock do you have a
 
05:38:20.788 --> 05:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
comment whether extending the lines
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
would would fix it I think it would
 
05:38:22.638 --> 05:38:24.150 align:start position:0%
would would fix it I think it would
address

05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:38:27.590 --> 05:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
represent Harrington's issues if the
 
05:38:30.430 --> 05:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
deadlines were extended to accommodate
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the time necessary to Grant an air
 
05:38:35.788 --> 05:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
permit whether that works for everybody
 
05:38:39.070 --> 05:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
in the group it's it's not a department
 
05:38:41.590 --> 05:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
the the department isn't responsible for
 
05:38:44.230 --> 05:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
the bill we uh helped with the drafting
 
05:38:49.548 --> 05:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
Etc but um the the people who would like
 
05:38:52.030 --> 05:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
who are or
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
um supporting the bill um um may have
 
05:38:59.230 --> 05:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
something to say about that I okay I
 
05:39:01.468 --> 05:39:01.478 align:start position:0%
can't answer thank you representative
 
05:39:03.910 --> 05:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
reels you have a comment yes thank you
 
05:39:08.430 --> 05:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I I respect um the point
 
05:39:10.948 --> 05:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
that representative Harrington is making
 
05:39:15.628 --> 05:39:15.638 align:start position:0%
but I ask wasn't the 180
 
05:39:17.788 --> 05:39:17.798 align:start position:0%
days deadline in the bill that we
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
considered this morning considered the
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
maximum time that Dees would be allowed
 
05:39:26.910 --> 05:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
to have to to issue a permit and the
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
point of this bill including 120 days is
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to give some urgency
 
05:39:36.750 --> 05:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
to these repurposing so I don't really
 
05:39:41.948 --> 05:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistent I see representative
 
05:39:44.160 --> 05:39:45.468 align:start position:0%
inconsistent I see representative
Harrington's

05:39:45.468 --> 05:39:45.478 align:start position:0%
Harrington's
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
point so at this point I think we're
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
looking for a
 
05:39:53.788 --> 05:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
fix um representative
 
05:39:56.670 --> 05:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair um I believe
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
the bill we passed recent just today
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
about on the air permits uh included the
 
05:40:04.468 --> 05:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
an exception for or didn't really
 
05:40:07.548 --> 05:40:07.558 align:start position:0%
include Title Five permits for um for
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
air for air emissions and I might be
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I think most power plants
 
05:40:14.868 --> 05:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
and most wood burning plants would be
 
05:40:16.868 --> 05:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
looking for a Title 5 permit because of
 
05:40:18.110 --> 05:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
the amount because of the type of
 
05:40:20.830 --> 05:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
emissions they they um they are they are
 
05:40:22.868 --> 05:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
emitting and so that's uh you know
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
something that that comes under the
 
05:40:26.548 --> 05:40:26.558 align:start position:0%
federal Clean Air Act and we don't know
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
the timeline for that so and you know
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at this I think that
 
05:40:33.310 --> 05:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
the uh perfect shouldn't be the enemy of
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
the good and we should just go with the
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
builtin Escape valve if you will of
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
requiring the applicant to you
 
05:40:45.548 --> 05:40:45.558 align:start position:0%
know ask for an ex an
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
extension good point we didn't um adopt
 
05:40:52.548 --> 05:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
449 this morning we just heard it but
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
but I think you're right about Title
 
05:40:57.430 --> 05:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
Five representative
 
05:41:01.510 --> 05:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
muns uh thank you Mr chair um I I wasn't
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
going to bring these up because they're
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
really not significant but um if we were
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
um a change uh an additional Amendment
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
um there is a there is a typo on line
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
one on page one line
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
15 uh that we might want to fix um the
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
modified energy facility would either I
 
05:41:28.430 --> 05:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
think there's we need a b there be be
 
05:41:32.190 --> 05:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
permitted um so that's one minor issue
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
and then on page
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
five this is a little bit more sub
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
substantive again I don't know that it's
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
what I would consider something to hold
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
up the amendment if everybody is
 
05:41:45.390 --> 05:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with everything else but at
 
05:41:46.868 --> 05:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
the top of the
 
05:41:49.948 --> 05:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
page um we talk about a public
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
information session in the city or town
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
where the particular case is um
 
05:41:59.548 --> 05:41:59.558 align:start position:0%
pending uh which is something we had
 
05:42:03.708 --> 05:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
talked about during um our work session
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
um and so we made the change there so
 
05:42:10.430 --> 05:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
that the meeting in the county would be
 
05:42:13.868 --> 05:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
in the town where the that that's most
 
05:42:16.190 --> 05:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
affected we made the change at the top
 
05:42:20.468 --> 05:42:20.478 align:start position:0%
of line five in lines two and three but
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
we did not make the
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
change um at the bottom of the
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
page uh where we also talk about a
 
05:42:30.430 --> 05:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
public Hearing in the in each
 
05:42:33.708 --> 05:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
County so again if we were going
 
05:42:36.628 --> 05:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
to request an additional amendment to
 
05:42:38.910 --> 05:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
address other concerns i' want to have
 
05:42:41.830 --> 05:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
us try to fix that as
 
05:42:45.670 --> 05:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
well does that make sense Yes except
 
05:42:48.590 --> 05:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
where at the bottom of the page uh p uh
 
05:42:52.708 --> 05:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
P bottom of page five line 33 where it
 
05:42:55.230 --> 05:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
says that site the site evaluation shall
 
05:42:58.310 --> 05:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
hold at least one public Hearing in each
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
County oh in in which the proposed
 
05:43:03.750 --> 05:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
facility is to be located and the idea
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
was to have it be in the town in the
 
05:43:08.670 --> 05:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
county where the facility was located we
 
05:43:22.990 --> 05:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
bottom but I don't want to be the sole
 
05:43:27.390 --> 05:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
reason for an amendment I have a
 
05:43:30.468 --> 05:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
question on that yes representative
 
05:43:32.070 --> 05:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah can someone explain to
 
05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
me what this means that dropped sentence
 
05:43:37.468 --> 05:43:37.478 align:start position:0%
there on uh page five says at Le least
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
one public information session in each
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
city or town in the case of a purposing
 
05:43:45.708 --> 05:43:45.718 align:start position:0%
and otherwise in each County what is
 
05:43:48.430 --> 05:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
repurposing in a case of a purposing is
 
05:43:49.708 --> 05:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
what mine says I don't know what that
 
05:43:51.230 --> 05:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
means it should be
 
05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
repurposing repos because purposing
 
05:43:55.390 --> 05:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
there I
 
05:44:00.468 --> 05:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know what purposing is a
 
05:44:02.230 --> 05:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
facility Mr
 
05:44:04.830 --> 05:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
chair can I can I try to address that
 
05:44:08.270 --> 05:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
you can help by all means I can't you're
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
I you know I hadn't caught that I mean
 
05:44:11.548 --> 05:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
you're right it should say repurposing
 
05:44:15.310 --> 05:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
the the in I know the intent was that
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
that that the that the required
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
information session to be held in the
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
county of the proposed facility would be
 
05:44:27.868 --> 05:44:27.878 align:start position:0%
in the town where that facility was
 
05:44:30.070 --> 05:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
located that was the intent now I don't
 
05:44:32.430 --> 05:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
know if maybe the wording could be
 
05:44:32.440 --> 05:44:35.548 align:start position:0%
know if maybe the wording could be
cleaned

05:44:35.548 --> 05:44:35.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:40.110 --> 05:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
up actually L 26 on page five also talks
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
about a
 
05:44:45.510 --> 05:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
purposing the actual term is defined is
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
a qualified repurposing so maybe that's
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
the term we should be using throughout
 
05:44:53.990 --> 05:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
the bill if you look on line five on
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
page one that's
 
05:45:01.350 --> 05:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
defined in fact on page one starting on
 
05:45:05.708 --> 05:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
line seven and going to page two through
 
05:45:09.150 --> 05:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
line four that's all new text that was
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
added to the amend to this amendment to
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
clarify just exactly what qualified
 
05:45:14.958 --> 05:45:16.468 align:start position:0%
clarify just exactly what qualified
repurposing

05:45:16.468 --> 05:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
repurposing
 
05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
means so that's one of the more
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
important parts of this amendment is
 
05:45:22.600 --> 05:45:23.510 align:start position:0%
important parts of this amendment is
that

05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
text that uh I just outlined from seven
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
on page one to four on page
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right so it sounds to me like maybe
 
05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
we need to do to U do some more work on
 
05:45:45.510 --> 05:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment before we move
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
forward or we could move forward
 
05:45:51.750 --> 05:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you um I
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
also just find the amendment as written
 
05:45:58.990 --> 05:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
unclear that uh it does apply to a
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
qualified repurposing so if you look at
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
page two line 7 the heading for 162 h7a
 
05:46:08.990 --> 05:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
says say qualified existing energy
 
05:46:12.510 --> 05:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
facilities repurposing but nowhere else
 
05:46:15.628 --> 05:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
in here does it say that all this
 
05:46:19.468 --> 05:46:19.478 align:start position:0%
procedure applies only to qualified
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
repurposing it's just listed in the
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
header it doesn't say these things apply
 
05:46:27.150 --> 05:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
to repurposing and then when you get to
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
um page five line 26
 
05:46:33.468 --> 05:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
1B it says except in the case of a
 
05:46:35.350 --> 05:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
qualified repurposing so apparently
 
05:46:37.510 --> 05:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's something about when there isn't
 
05:46:39.788 --> 05:46:39.798 align:start position:0%
a qualified repurposing so it seems to
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.310 --> 05:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
when so would you be advocating that the
 
05:46:54.270 --> 05:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
word repurposing be inserted before the
 
05:46:54.280 --> 05:46:55.310 align:start position:0%
word repurposing be inserted before the
word

05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
word
 
05:46:57.670 --> 05:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
application on
 
05:46:57.680 --> 05:47:00.590 align:start position:0%
application on
lines

05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:47:02.350 --> 05:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
10 and
 
05:47:07.868 --> 05:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
Below um which page page two page two
 
05:47:10.070 --> 05:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
so instead of saying upon filing of an
 
05:47:12.510 --> 05:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
application it would say upon filing of
 
05:47:14.750 --> 05:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
a repurposing
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
application or qualified repurposing
 
05:47:20.670 --> 05:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
application well I mean the the the
 
05:47:22.510 --> 05:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
issue I have here is if you look at line
 
05:47:24.430 --> 05:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
eight of that page it says all
 
05:47:26.350 --> 05:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
applications for a certificate for an
 
05:47:26.360 --> 05:47:28.030 align:start position:0%
applications for a certificate for an
energy

05:47:28.030 --> 05:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
energy
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
facility so it's not saying it's not
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
restricting it only to the
 
05:47:34.990 --> 05:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
qualified right I think we need
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
something that says section
 
05:47:46.628 --> 05:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:49.070 --> 05:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
repurposing yeah qualified ex yeah I I
 
05:47:50.750 --> 05:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
take your point yeah I think I think it
 
05:47:52.390 --> 05:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
just needs to say that and then and then
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
of course what I said about on page five
 
05:47:56.590 --> 05:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
where it says except in the case of a
 
05:47:59.948 --> 05:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
qualified repurposing so why are we
 
05:48:03.150 --> 05:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
saying accept in the
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
case Mr
 
05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
Mahan could I ask you you
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
to come up to the microphone and let us
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
know whether you think such clarifying
 
05:48:15.708 --> 05:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
language is necessary here um I don't
 
05:48:17.110 --> 05:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the amendment that you're
 
05:48:26.430 --> 05:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
one this is this is essentially the the
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
text that yeah and I and I'll jump right
 
05:48:33.468 --> 05:48:33.478 align:start position:0%
into I
 
05:48:37.750 --> 05:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
think um RSA going from memory here but
 
05:48:39.548 --> 05:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
it got chilled in my head last week the
 
05:48:41.590 --> 05:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh is it 162
 
05:48:45.030 --> 05:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
h7a uh is a new section right so it only
 
05:48:47.070 --> 05:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
applies to the qualified
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.468 --> 05:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
um so what representative Corman is
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that maybe we need a new
 
05:49:03.150 --> 05:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
section one that says the following
 
05:49:05.548 --> 05:49:05.558 align:start position:0%
applies only to qualified repurposing
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
just for for clarity
 
05:49:10.310 --> 05:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
I think yes I think for clarity purposes
 
05:49:11.788 --> 05:49:11.798 align:start position:0%
that makes sense I don't know that it's
 
05:49:13.310 --> 05:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
necessary but again I don't have I'm
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
looking at this version for the first
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
time the intention was that uh 162 h7a
 
05:49:21.990 --> 05:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
only applied to the qualified
 
05:49:24.510 --> 05:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
repurposing um
 
05:49:28.868 --> 05:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
track but given the fact that 162 H is a
 
05:49:31.750 --> 05:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
an extremely long and and complicated
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
RSA MH to eliminate the possibility that
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
the FastTrack
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
section and the regular section don't
 
05:49:42.070 --> 05:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
get confused maybe it's worthwhile to
 
05:49:44.030 --> 05:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
point out that this applies only to the
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
fast track no I think perfectly fine and
 
05:49:47.548 --> 05:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
as we've said from the beginning we want
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the sub evaluation
 
05:49:50.590 --> 05:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
committee has as much guidance as
 
05:49:51.990 --> 05:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
possible so I think that that would
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's a very helpful
 
05:49:55.590 --> 05:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
change okay thank you and and I would
 
05:49:57.230 --> 05:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
say in that case when we go back to page
 
05:50:00.150 --> 05:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
five line 26 where we have this bolded
 
05:50:01.708 --> 05:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
language except in the case of a
 
05:50:03.708 --> 05:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
qualified purposing which maybe should
 
05:50:06.430 --> 05:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
be repurposing do we even need that if
 
05:50:08.788 --> 05:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
the the assumption is that everything in
 
05:50:16.350 --> 05:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
repurposing yeah except that by the time
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
you get to that text on page five line
 
05:50:23.708 --> 05:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
26 now you're in a different section of
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
the RSA now you're in RSA 162
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
h10 right so oh so maybe that text does
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:56.910 --> 05:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:00.190 --> 05:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying okay further comments from
 
05:51:00.200 --> 05:51:01.590 align:start position:0%
qualifying okay further comments from
the

05:51:01.590 --> 05:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
committee representative Corman yeah so
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh given that when I look at uh page
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
four um starting on line 4 162
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
h7b role of state
 
05:51:20.510 --> 05:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
agencies that section applies to all
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
site evaluation not just the FastTrack
 
05:51:41.548 --> 05:51:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:44.110 --> 05:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
think the same any clarification on that
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh rep Mr Monahan I'm looking back at uh
 
05:51:51.110 --> 05:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
Dave Dave maybe if Dave shulok joined me
 
05:51:52.548 --> 05:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
because we worked in this language yes
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
Mr shulock could you come up
 
05:51:57.788 --> 05:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
please and I'm just a little hesitant to
 
05:51:58.868 --> 05:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
jump right into an answer because I
 
05:52:01.030 --> 05:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the full Statute in front of
 
05:52:03.990 --> 05:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
me so yeah it's a little hard seeing it
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
today even in right we his the question
 
05:52:12.430 --> 05:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
is on page four beginning in line four
 
05:52:13.750 --> 05:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the role of state
 
05:52:15.868 --> 05:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
agency is that is just for the
 
05:52:18.310 --> 05:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
FasTrack provisions of the new
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
law no
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay 162
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
everything so so so then the fast track
 
05:52:33.990 --> 05:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
is really only
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
7A and the definitions
 
05:52:38.868 --> 05:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
that's correct and then um the
 
05:52:41.070 --> 05:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
definition and then some of those minor
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
changes that you see in 162 h10 right
 
05:52:47.110 --> 05:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
and there is a difference between notice
 
05:52:50.310 --> 05:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
notice is given in the town but the
 
05:52:52.750 --> 05:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
hearing is held in the
 
05:52:55.468 --> 05:52:55.478 align:start position:0%
county the way that this is written
 
05:52:58.750 --> 05:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
right and that is um it's written it can
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
be changed I'm not saying it can't be
 
05:53:02.230 --> 05:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
changed but the reason that it's written
 
05:53:05.070 --> 05:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
that way uh is because that section does
 
05:53:07.270 --> 05:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
apply to all hearings
 
05:53:08.510 --> 05:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh which would include transmission
 
05:53:09.788 --> 05:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
hearings and sometimes those
 
05:53:12.430 --> 05:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
transmission facilities span multiple
 
05:53:14.390 --> 05:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and it's inefficient to
 
05:53:17.948 --> 05:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
have that in just in every town as
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
opposed to in the county where most of
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
those municipalities are likely located
 
05:53:25.948 --> 05:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
you know Mr chair could I could I
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
address that yeah representative M um I
 
05:53:31.070 --> 05:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying and and
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
I certainly wasn't arguing that we'd
 
05:53:36.750 --> 05:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
want to have a um Hearing in every town
 
05:53:39.788 --> 05:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
the whole reason for having it in the
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
town where the repurposed facility or
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
the facil is located is it just makes it
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
more convenient for the people that are
 
05:53:47.830 --> 05:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
most affected to be able to get
 
05:53:50.190 --> 05:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
there that that's that's the whole
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
reason right
 
05:53:57.150 --> 05:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
and that fix could probably be drafted
 
05:53:59.468 --> 05:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
it's just not in there
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
currently yeah certainly you unfort you
 
05:54:06.628 --> 05:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
have to distinguish between what this is
 
05:54:08.708 --> 05:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
mostly about which is facility an
 
05:54:10.628 --> 05:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
existing facility in one town and one
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
location I understand where you'd need
 
05:54:16.590 --> 05:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
the ability for pipeline or transmission
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
line to be the
 
05:54:23.468 --> 05:54:23.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.990 --> 05:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
transmission let's assume
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
that National Grid sold their existing
 
05:54:32.190 --> 05:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
transmission line that runs through the
 
05:54:35.150 --> 05:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
state to a different company and that
 
05:54:37.590 --> 05:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
company wanted to
 
05:54:41.468 --> 05:54:41.478 align:start position:0%
repurpose that transmission line to I
 
05:54:45.628 --> 05:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
don't know threat Curr what DC yeah
 
05:54:45.638 --> 05:54:46.590 align:start position:0%
don't know threat Curr what DC yeah
direct

05:54:46.590 --> 05:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
direct
 
05:54:50.948 --> 05:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
current uh would that require site
 
05:54:55.150 --> 05:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee uh approval to do
 
05:54:57.708 --> 05:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
that and is that would that be covered
 
05:54:59.628 --> 05:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
by this repurposing
 
05:55:01.830 --> 05:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
statute I don't have the statute here in
 
05:55:04.350 --> 05:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
front of me there are it would depend on
 
05:55:06.590 --> 05:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
the length of the transmission line all
 
05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:12.868 --> 05:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
variables okay well something worth
 
05:55:15.230 --> 05:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
considering I guess all right
 
05:55:15.240 --> 05:55:16.430 align:start position:0%
considering I guess all right
representative

05:55:16.430 --> 05:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
Ms sorry if I opened up a Pandora's Box
 
05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
um I have a a question um on
 
05:55:32.070 --> 05:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
page on on page two um line three uh one
 
05:55:35.230 --> 05:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
of the one of the elements of the
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
definition of of a qualified repurposing
 
05:55:41.910 --> 05:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
is that the applicant demonstrates that
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
the modification may result in
 
05:55:45.310 --> 05:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
qualitative improvements in the health
 
05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
and safety of the state or the system
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
reliability in New Hampshire I guess I
 
05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
have two questions about that one is how
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
do how do you demonstrate
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
that um and then the second uh question
 
05:56:02.708 --> 05:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
is um can you demonstrate that before
 
05:56:04.510 --> 05:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
the fact or do you have or is a
 
05:56:06.390 --> 05:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
demonstration after the fact I mean you
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
don't really
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
know what's going to
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
happen so I I guess my my my first
 
05:56:14.430 --> 05:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
question was do we need to be a little
 
05:56:15.948 --> 05:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
bit more specific in terms of what
 
05:56:15.958 --> 05:56:18.350 align:start position:0%
bit more specific in terms of what
demonstrate

05:56:18.350 --> 05:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
05:56:20.868 --> 05:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
means so I
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
think yeah this was among all the
 
05:56:24.750 --> 05:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
parties who worked on this language this
 
05:56:27.030 --> 05:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
was an important part to be included I
 
05:56:28.390 --> 05:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
think it's important that understand
 
05:56:30.270 --> 05:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
this is part of the application to make
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
it into the FastTrack process but then
 
05:56:34.830 --> 05:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
when you look at the five-part criteria
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
that the site evaluation committee has
 
05:56:38.430 --> 05:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
has to use to approve everything it
 
05:56:40.590 --> 05:56:40.600 align:start position:0%
includes a more substantial
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of the issues around
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
public health and safety Financial
 
05:56:48.548 --> 05:56:48.558 align:start position:0%
managerial things like that so um uh
 
05:56:50.510 --> 05:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
just just like everything else in the
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
application you need to during the
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
process once it's filed is you need to
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.830 --> 05:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
and representative Summers has a
 
05:57:04.310 --> 05:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
question just a quick question um just
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
because of confusing going back and
 
05:57:07.708 --> 05:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
forth should there be a defined
 
05:57:10.350 --> 05:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
definition of what is part of this
 
05:57:13.150 --> 05:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is in Fast trck and what is
 
05:57:17.468 --> 05:57:17.478 align:start position:0%
throughout all in including
 
05:57:19.830 --> 05:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
FasTrack yeah we we kind of addressed
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
that a moment ago when we talked about
 
05:57:22.160 --> 05:57:24.708 align:start position:0%
that a moment ago when we talked about
adding

05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
adding
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
online8 a new section one that says that
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
this section H7 hon
 
05:57:36.350 --> 05:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
7-a applies only to qualified repurpose
 
05:57:36.360 --> 05:57:38.708 align:start position:0%
7-a applies only to qualified repurpose
ing

05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
ing
 
05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
applications it's kind of hard looking
 
05:57:43.990 --> 05:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
at this amendment to realize that this
 
05:57:48.190 --> 05:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
is part of RSA 162 which right now is
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
about I forget how many pages 30 pages
 
05:57:51.440 --> 05:57:53.030 align:start position:0%
about I forget how many pages 30 pages
long

05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
so taking this out of context of of that
 
05:58:00.670 --> 05:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
that larger
 
05:58:03.468 --> 05:58:03.478 align:start position:0%
picture is a little
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
confusing so
 
05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm not saying that you're
 
05:58:09.990 --> 05:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
confused I'm saying it could be
 
05:58:13.948 --> 05:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
confusing to all of us but so but but a
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
75 page Amendment would have been
 
05:58:18.670 --> 05:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
equally confusing yeah 75 page Amendment
 
05:58:21.468 --> 05:58:21.478 align:start position:0%
would have been really confusing so all
 
05:58:24.230 --> 05:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
right further representative
 
05:58:26.310 --> 05:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington getting back to what was just
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned there I I I I tend to agree
 
05:58:31.948 --> 05:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
that we need and that's on line three of
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
page two the applicant demonstrates the
 
05:58:35.750 --> 05:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
modification may result in qualitative
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
Improv mement the health and safety of
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
the state or to system reliability in
 
05:58:42.868 --> 05:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire far Fest case but let's
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
say someone repow a wood burning plant
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
with coal now that may add to the system
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh reliability of New Hampshire but it's
 
05:58:52.910 --> 05:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
probably not going to add to the health
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
and safety of the state so you could do
 
05:58:56.590 --> 05:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
one without the other so the way this is
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
written you'd only have to qualify for
 
05:59:02.350 --> 05:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
one so you could reduce the uh system
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
reliability in New Hampshire as long as
 
05:59:05.788 --> 05:59:05.798 align:start position:0%
you made improvements to health and
 
05:59:05.798 --> 05:59:06.750 align:start position:0%
you made improvements to health and
safety

05:59:06.750 --> 05:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:59:09.030 --> 05:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
or you could increase the system
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
reliability regardless of what effect
 
05:59:12.110 --> 05:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
you had on self health and safety I
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
think that statement is way too vague in
 
05:59:15.708 --> 05:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
it's an either or you can meet one of
 
05:59:17.230 --> 05:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
two requirements you don't have to meet
 
05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
both so how about if we change the word
 
05:59:23.070 --> 05:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
or to and improvements to the health and
 
05:59:24.910 --> 05:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
safety of the state and to system
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
reliability it's that's an improvement
 
05:59:29.430 --> 05:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
for sure but it's it's still it's a very
 
05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
vague Loosely defined term on health and
 
05:59:34.990 --> 05:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
safety and system reliability there is
 
05:59:37.910 --> 05:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
no formula you pushing into and say
 
05:59:39.430 --> 05:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
count out the crank oh yeah the system
 
05:59:42.390 --> 05:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
of reliability went from 8.4 to 8.5 so
 
05:59:44.070 --> 05:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
we've improved it and the health and
 
05:59:46.628 --> 05:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
safety went from 3.0 to 3.6 we've
 
05:59:49.150 --> 05:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
improved it it's it's totally arbitrary
 
05:59:52.030 --> 05:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
is what it's in the eye of the beholder
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
I guess Mr manahan you said that this
 
05:59:55.670 --> 05:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
line was important to some of the
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
stakeholders could you elaborate on
 
06:00:01.990 --> 06:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah I think that uh there were
 
06:00:03.548 --> 06:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
as the committee may know there were
 
06:00:05.230 --> 06:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
some folks that were concerned that were
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
were advocating that this change only
 
06:00:10.430 --> 06:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
applied to facilities that were going to
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
repower without repow with um renewable
 
06:00:17.310 --> 06:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
or clean energy um I felt as though and
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
I think most of the people that worked
 
06:00:20.750 --> 06:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
on that felt that that was a didn't
 
06:00:22.390 --> 06:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
belong there because this this
 
06:00:24.310 --> 06:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
essentially a land use spill and
 
06:00:26.030 --> 06:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
anything that deals with emissions
 
06:00:28.910 --> 06:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
belongs in another part of state law and
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
so the um suggestion that would that I
 
06:00:34.350 --> 06:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
think I made was to use health and
 
06:00:36.430 --> 06:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
safety but I didn't make that up
 
06:00:37.948 --> 06:00:37.958 align:start position:0%
uh those are requirements that are
 
06:00:39.750 --> 06:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
already exist in other parts of the
 
06:00:42.350 --> 06:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
citing law and so it's a uh we're
 
06:00:44.030 --> 06:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
repeating what already exists and I
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't have the whole RSA 162
 
06:00:48.110 --> 06:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
in front of me but it seemed to be that
 
06:00:50.670 --> 06:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
because it had existed in state law and
 
06:00:52.830 --> 06:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure even commissioner
 
06:00:54.230 --> 06:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
Harrington at the time when is sitting
 
06:00:56.350 --> 06:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
on some site evaluation committee things
 
06:00:58.510 --> 06:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
there was probably a provision that is a
 
06:00:59.948 --> 06:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
part of the review there was a review of
 
06:01:02.030 --> 06:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
the health and safety
 
06:01:06.590 --> 06:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
so MH y if I may add yeah yes go ahead
 
06:01:09.390 --> 06:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
the language or contributes to system
 
06:01:11.708 --> 06:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
reliability uh that was added by the
 
06:01:15.430 --> 06:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
department so um because the department
 
06:01:18.030 --> 06:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
views the bill as technology neutral
 
06:01:18.040 --> 06:01:19.628 align:start position:0%
views the bill as technology neutral
right

06:01:19.628 --> 06:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:01:22.270 --> 06:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
um we understand that everything that's
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
on the table for the coming years is
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
most likely renewable and it's most
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
likely not wood because it's not
 
06:01:32.190 --> 06:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
economic right and uh we don't really
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
see anybody trying to uh repower or with
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
coal or some or wood with coal or
 
06:01:42.750 --> 06:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
something like that um it was actually
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
added there to try and make it easier
 
06:01:49.788 --> 06:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
for Battery Systems to show some
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
contribution uh to be to be able to get
 
06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
FASTT tracked but um if the sponsors of
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bill believe that they can make a
 
06:02:00.190 --> 06:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
showing under health and safety for
 
06:02:02.750 --> 06:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
those batteries uh the
 
06:02:05.628 --> 06:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
department would withdraw that request
 
06:02:05.638 --> 06:02:07.070 align:start position:0%
department would withdraw that request
right

06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:02:11.070 --> 06:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah representative McGee I would
 
06:02:12.910 --> 06:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
just respond to that and say I I don't
 
06:02:14.350 --> 06:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
think you should I think it's there
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
purposefully I think the idea is that if
 
06:02:20.430 --> 06:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
you have a consideration for reliability
 
06:02:22.230 --> 06:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
in there then it means that the projects
 
06:02:24.350 --> 06:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
are going to be considered in that way
 
06:02:26.430 --> 06:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
which means they may end up having that
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
storage component or another piece so so
 
06:02:31.190 --> 06:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's saying we want we want to consider
 
06:02:32.830 --> 06:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
both right we want we want to make sure
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
that the projects provide those things
 
06:02:37.628 --> 06:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
in the best case scenario so I think the
 
06:02:40.830 --> 06:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
stay again I know I mentioned this
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
before but this the section what we're
 
06:02:46.468 --> 06:02:46.478 align:start position:0%
referring to is simply what's in the in
 
06:02:48.510 --> 06:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
the application and then the application
 
06:02:51.150 --> 06:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
has to be proven with expert testimony
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
and and Witnesses and things like that
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
so yeah thanks representative Harrington
 
06:03:00.468 --> 06:03:00.478 align:start position:0%
but my problem is again it's it's an
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
either or situation and I think you want
 
06:03:04.708 --> 06:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
both if that's the intent of this is
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
that it and also got May and if you're
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
saying you've got to back it up with
 
06:03:10.230 --> 06:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
proof and everything we shouldn't be
 
06:03:12.670 --> 06:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
using the word may because May means it
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
may show it it may not it's not a
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
requirement so you should say the
 
06:03:18.430 --> 06:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
applicant demonstrates that the
 
06:03:20.310 --> 06:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
modification will result in a
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
qualitative Improvement to health and
 
06:03:24.190 --> 06:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
safety of the state and to system
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
reliability in New Hampshire if that's
 
06:03:27.510 --> 06:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
the intent that's the way it should be
 
06:03:29.788 --> 06:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
written because with a May ites it's not
 
06:03:32.110 --> 06:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
a requirement it says they may show that
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
it's being done so it's you know and
 
06:03:36.830 --> 06:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
again with the or you could pick one and
 
06:03:38.670 --> 06:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
not the other so I think it definitely
 
06:03:39.868 --> 06:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
06:03:43.868 --> 06:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
work do you have a comment on on that
 
06:03:47.628 --> 06:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
question so um the the purpose for
 
06:03:50.030 --> 06:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
having the May there um and having it to
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
be qualitative was to make it easier for
 
06:03:57.030 --> 06:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
the chair or the administrator of the
 
06:04:00.990 --> 06:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
SEC to approve or deny a FasTrack
 
06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
without any sort of litigation or
 
06:04:06.468 --> 06:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
argument over whether there is an actual
 
06:04:06.478 --> 06:04:07.788 align:start position:0%
argument over whether there is an actual
and

06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:10.670 --> 06:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
quantitative uh benefit to the state so
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
that applicants don't have to come in
 
06:04:15.628 --> 06:04:15.638 align:start position:0%
saying that uh we're reducing carbon by
 
06:04:19.350 --> 06:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
x amount and that's going to result in
 
06:04:22.390 --> 06:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
why fewer cases of asthma in the town
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
and is going to save the state X
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars right
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
that that they wouldn't have to go
 
06:04:31.628 --> 06:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
through that type of proof just to
 
06:04:33.910 --> 06:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for a faster
 
06:04:36.788 --> 06:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
track but whether whether whether you do
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
that that's certainly a policy question
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
right so if if you want more proof up
 
06:04:41.040 --> 06:04:42.510 align:start position:0%
right so if if you want more proof up
front

06:04:42.510 --> 06:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
front
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's okay representative
 
06:04:48.510 --> 06:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
reels yeah um again I I understand what
 
06:04:50.110 --> 06:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington is getting at
 
06:04:52.590 --> 06:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
but I would I guess refer to the answer
 
06:04:55.750 --> 06:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
just given and I don't think we want to
 
06:04:58.948 --> 06:04:58.958 align:start position:0%
make this change from sh from May to
 
06:04:58.958 --> 06:05:01.070 align:start position:0%
make this change from sh from May to
shall

06:05:01.070 --> 06:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
shall
 
06:05:04.310 --> 06:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
because you're it would be taking a bill
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
that's intended to facilitate things
 
06:05:09.270 --> 06:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
happening and now uh raising raising the
 
06:05:12.750 --> 06:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
bar to you know require all kinds of
 
06:05:15.708 --> 06:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
data and proof and in this case or with
 
06:05:17.390 --> 06:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
respect to reliability the state of New
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not
 
06:05:21.150 --> 06:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
the AR you know Department of energy is
 
06:05:23.390 --> 06:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
not the Arbiter of system reliability
 
06:05:24.910 --> 06:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
right that's a that's a responsibility
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
of the regional grid operator so you'd
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
be you'd be putting a burden on the
 
06:05:30.750 --> 06:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy to evaluate
 
06:05:33.510 --> 06:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
something that it's really not empowered
 
06:05:37.788 --> 06:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
to to to evaluate representative Corman
 
06:05:40.110 --> 06:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean I I I I interpret the
 
06:05:42.150 --> 06:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
May part as saying that there's a
 
06:05:42.160 --> 06:05:43.510 align:start position:0%
May part as saying that there's a
plausible

06:05:43.510 --> 06:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
plausible
 
06:05:46.430 --> 06:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
argument toward the health and safety
 
06:05:48.788 --> 06:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
and the system reliability and as far as
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
whether to change or to and I I would be
 
06:05:54.070 --> 06:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
against that uh just take a simple
 
06:05:57.910 --> 06:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
scenario where there's no change to the
 
06:05:59.910 --> 06:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
health and safety but a big change to
 
06:06:02.270 --> 06:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
reliability I wouldn't want to not allow
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
that to be fast-tracked because it
 
06:06:06.110 --> 06:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the and
 
06:06:08.190 --> 06:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
and just to take representative
 
06:06:11.350 --> 06:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
Harrington's scenario of something uh
 
06:06:15.190 --> 06:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
improves Rel reliability but is uh a
 
06:06:17.468 --> 06:06:17.478 align:start position:0%
detriment to health and safety maybe it
 
06:06:19.788 --> 06:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
gets fast-tracked but then later on is
 
06:06:21.868 --> 06:06:21.878 align:start position:0%
denied because of that so it's not like
 
06:06:24.030 --> 06:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
we're automatically going to approve it
 
06:06:26.350 --> 06:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
if it's detrimental to health and safety
 
06:06:28.868 --> 06:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
we're just fast-tracking the application
 
06:06:30.468 --> 06:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
and then maybe in fact the denial
 
06:06:30.478 --> 06:06:33.190 align:start position:0%
and then maybe in fact the denial
happens

06:06:33.190 --> 06:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:36.190 --> 06:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
sooner okay further discuss
 
06:06:38.510 --> 06:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative licki in the same section
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
it says demonstrates um expert testimony
 
06:06:44.590 --> 06:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
or assertions are not a demonstration
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
turning the thing on and seeing the
 
06:06:47.670 --> 06:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
actual results is the only thing that
 
06:06:52.270 --> 06:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:56.590 --> 06:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
it well it says the applicant
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
demonstrates and I think it basically
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
means the application
 
06:07:05.070 --> 06:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrates but once again an
 
06:07:09.548 --> 06:07:09.558 align:start position:0%
application demonstrates nothing except
 
06:07:12.510 --> 06:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
paper the application application can
 
06:07:15.670 --> 06:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate intent and can
 
06:07:20.150 --> 06:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh with further information
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
just how it intends to provide the
 
06:07:25.310 --> 06:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
improvements to health and
 
06:07:32.270 --> 06:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:35.708 --> 06:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
reliability Mike uh demonstrating intent
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
is not the same as demonstrating the
 
06:07:39.590 --> 06:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
actual performance every one of us here
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
has seen various unintended consequences
 
06:07:45.390 --> 06:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
um and consequences of things that did
 
06:07:47.990 --> 06:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
not go according to plan I've spent a
 
06:07:50.990 --> 06:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime seeing that kind of thing but
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
since this is just an application you're
 
06:07:54.750 --> 06:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
never going to be able to
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate uh performance until after
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
the application is approved and the
 
06:08:06.430 --> 06:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:07.868 --> 06:08:07.878 align:start position:0%
all right maybe a different word than
 
06:08:10.270 --> 06:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrate com on this
 
06:08:13.708 --> 06:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
please yes representative McGee um I
 
06:08:15.468 --> 06:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
think we're you know we're having a
 
06:08:17.468 --> 06:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
great time here we trying to word Smith
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
this but if you can demonstrate in the
 
06:08:24.628 --> 06:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
application that you are putting in a
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
technology that does not emit replacing
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
a technology that does emit then you
 
06:08:31.150 --> 06:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
have demonstrated that you have made an
 
06:08:34.150 --> 06:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
improvement to health and that is that
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
is an example that I would use right
 
06:08:37.990 --> 06:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is a qualitative demonstration that
 
06:08:40.030 --> 06:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
you have lowered the emissions of a
 
06:08:42.270 --> 06:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
plant and so that is I think what they
 
06:08:43.750 --> 06:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
mean by it that's what the language
 
06:08:45.150 --> 06:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
means it doesn't mean that they're going
 
06:08:46.510 --> 06:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
to come in and give you a demonstration
 
06:08:48.070 --> 06:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the technology they're planning to
 
06:08:50.150 --> 06:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
implement it means that they're going to
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
give you some qualitative information
 
06:08:55.070 --> 06:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
about how the technology is an
 
06:08:56.990 --> 06:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
improvement as a result of the
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
repurposing of the
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
facility that's that's what I think the
 
06:09:02.830 --> 06:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
intention of the language is not to give
 
06:09:04.990 --> 06:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
an intent but to say the application is
 
06:09:07.230 --> 06:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
a place where you can make that
 
06:09:11.590 --> 06:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
technology representative Harrington I
 
06:09:16.270 --> 06:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
think we what we need to do here is
 
06:09:18.990 --> 06:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
first decide what we're trying to say
 
06:09:20.110 --> 06:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that would make it a little
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
bit easier because with the word may
 
06:09:25.548 --> 06:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
there it's not a requirement that it be
 
06:09:28.190 --> 06:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
done so the applicant demonstrates the
 
06:09:30.430 --> 06:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
modification may result in well they can
 
06:09:31.788 --> 06:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
just say we think this will result
 
06:09:33.548 --> 06:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
improvements to the health and safety or
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
reliability of the system I mean I don't
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
know why we have may um to me that's
 
06:09:40.750 --> 06:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
something you you could be just like was
 
06:09:42.310 --> 06:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
just said you put in some type of a
 
06:09:45.990 --> 06:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
logic we're replacing coal with uh wind
 
06:09:47.868 --> 06:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
and therefore the emissions will go down
 
06:09:49.030 --> 06:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
and so that you're showing the health
 
06:09:51.948 --> 06:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
and safeties being taken care of and
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
then I still go back to the either or
 
06:09:56.070 --> 06:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
situation or do you need it at all what
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
happens if they they don't show that
 
06:10:00.468 --> 06:10:00.478 align:start position:0%
does that mean it can't be fast-tracked
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
unless it meets one of those criteria or
 
06:10:06.628 --> 06:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
both so if it I mean you can certainly
 
06:10:07.868 --> 06:10:07.878 align:start position:0%
put in something that improves system
 
06:10:09.830 --> 06:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
reliability that's not going to improve
 
06:10:11.190 --> 06:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
the health and safety it may not hurt
 
06:10:12.510 --> 06:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
the health and safety but it's not going
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
to necessarily improve it so we trying
 
06:10:16.910 --> 06:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
to say here's two criteria you got to
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
meet you may have to meet one of them or
 
06:10:20.708 --> 06:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
you absolutely have to meet one of them
 
06:10:22.430 --> 06:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
or would be better to put in the
 
06:10:25.708 --> 06:10:25.718 align:start position:0%
negative and say does not result in
 
06:10:27.430 --> 06:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
lessening of the health and safety of
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
the of the state or reliability of the
 
06:10:33.030 --> 06:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire and that would
 
06:10:34.708 --> 06:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
just prove that would basically say
 
06:10:36.910 --> 06:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're not making things worse or
 
06:10:38.468 --> 06:10:38.478 align:start position:0%
do we have to make things better I don't
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
think that question is being answered in
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
this statement it kind of leaves it
 
06:10:44.468 --> 06:10:44.478 align:start position:0%
hanging it probably means that you have
 
06:10:47.390 --> 06:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
to meet one or the other or both that's
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
probably what it means representative
 
06:10:53.948 --> 06:10:53.958 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh yeah thanks you know a small
 
06:10:56.468 --> 06:10:56.478 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor would increase
 
06:10:58.948 --> 06:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
reliability and health and safety if it
 
06:11:01.868 --> 06:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
was replacing a coal plant but the whole
 
06:11:03.868 --> 06:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
point of this thing is wind and solar
 
06:11:05.830 --> 06:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
even though those words do not appear
 
06:11:07.910 --> 06:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere I mean this is what I said
 
06:11:09.708 --> 06:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
during the the meeting this this thingss
 
06:11:12.708 --> 06:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
to want to dance around what the purpose
 
06:11:18.868 --> 06:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:23.390 --> 06:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:25.990 --> 06:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
comment looks like representative
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
Kennedy gets the last word on this on
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
this bill it seems to me that um this
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
amendment is not ready for prime time at
 
06:11:39.150 --> 06:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
the moment it needs another draft so I
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
think that I will um continue this P
 
06:11:45.310 --> 06:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
this executive session until a future
 
06:11:47.948 --> 06:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
date certain so keep an eye on your
 
06:11:51.390 --> 06:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
calendar and we will uh reschedule this
 
06:11:54.910 --> 06:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
executive session for a future date so
 
06:11:55.708 --> 06:11:55.718 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
06:11:59.548 --> 06:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
to uh recess this public hearing uh
 
06:12:03.670 --> 06:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
executive session on Senate Bill
 
06:12:07.270 --> 06:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
451 and in the meantime we will try to
 
06:12:10.510 --> 06:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
create a new Amendment and
 
06:12:13.270 --> 06:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative muns I would like to
 
06:12:13.280 --> 06:12:14.350 align:start position:0%
representative muns I would like to
enlist

06:12:14.350 --> 06:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
enlist
 
06:12:17.948 --> 06:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
your your Aid in crafting new language
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
for page five on line
 
06:12:26.270 --> 06:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
two and three the bolded text which is
 
06:12:27.910 --> 06:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
really confusing
 
06:12:30.830 --> 06:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
language and
 
06:12:34.270 --> 06:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
also for line 33 where that the same
 
06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
text that you use in line two and three
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
should go in line 33 so could you help
 
06:12:43.468 --> 06:12:43.478 align:start position:0%
create new text for that y I'd
 
06:12:43.478 --> 06:12:45.548 align:start position:0%
create new text for that y I'd
appreciate

06:12:45.548 --> 06:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
06:12:50.390 --> 06:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
that and representative McGee and I will
 
06:12:51.948 --> 06:12:51.958 align:start position:0%
submit to
 
06:12:56.150 --> 06:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
O um the changes that we have identified
 
06:12:57.750 --> 06:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
that need to be make made to this
 
06:13:00.150 --> 06:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and ask for a new Amendment
 
06:13:01.708 --> 06:13:01.718 align:start position:0%
which we will
 
06:13:03.948 --> 06:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
consider the next time we meet an
 
06:13:06.830 --> 06:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
executive session on this
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
Bill okay so I'll just feed my language
 
06:13:12.910 --> 06:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
to the two of you yes please
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay now let's move on I'd like to
 
06:13:21.868 --> 06:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
open an exec session on Senate Bill
 
06:13:24.468 --> 06:13:24.478 align:start position:0%
540 and I'd like to recognize
 
06:13:27.430 --> 06:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi for a
 
06:13:29.990 --> 06:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
motion I'm moand from
 
06:13:33.510 --> 06:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
study I recognize representative Kennedy
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
I second the motion moved in seconded
 
06:13:38.350 --> 06:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we refer Senate Bill 450 for
 
06:13:38.360 --> 06:13:39.788 align:start position:0%
that we refer Senate Bill 450 for
interim

06:13:39.788 --> 06:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
interim
 
06:13:44.110 --> 06:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
study 540 sorry 540 for interim study
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
Bernardi uh yes looking at the bill uh
 
06:13:52.750 --> 06:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
the great bulk of it discusses utility
 
06:13:55.990 --> 06:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
scale energy storage that is not the
 
06:13:57.788 --> 06:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
province of the Department of energy
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's the province of iso New England
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
06:14:06.390 --> 06:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
therefore um only part part of the bill
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
in my mind appears relevant for any kind
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
of uh further study which would be that
 
06:14:17.948 --> 06:14:17.958 align:start position:0%
battery storage or battery
 
06:14:21.110 --> 06:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
capability uh that would be relevant to
 
06:14:24.590 --> 06:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh residential or maybe small
 
06:14:28.868 --> 06:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
commercial customers um for looking at
 
06:14:34.788 --> 06:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
what value behind the meter uh um energy
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
with would be and there's nothing in the
 
06:14:40.110 --> 06:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
bill that that says what we're going to
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
do with that information when we get
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
there so I think it really requires some
 
06:14:48.590 --> 06:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
kind of of study to see if there's any
 
06:14:52.910 --> 06:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:55.468 --> 06:14:55.478 align:start position:0%
all okay further discussion
 
06:14:59.270 --> 06:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank
 
06:15:03.548 --> 06:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
you I feel that um behind the meter
 
06:15:03.558 --> 06:15:05.190 align:start position:0%
you I feel that um behind the meter
storage

06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
storage
 
06:15:08.190 --> 06:15:08.200 align:start position:0%
and utility scale storage are extremely
 
06:15:11.110 --> 06:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
important to our Energy Future we talk
 
06:15:16.030 --> 06:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
about reliability being key and storage
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
is one way that we're going to be
 
06:15:20.750 --> 06:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
achieving that going forward especially
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
as we go toward renewable
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
sources the bill does actually talk
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
about uh things that can be done I mean
 
06:15:32.788 --> 06:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at line 14 how best to
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
encourage both utility and non-utility
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
investments in energy storage projects
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
so it it it can actually result in some
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
really good ideas that utility and
 
06:15:46.230 --> 06:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
people like me actually do have
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
batteries now um Can can actually put
 
06:15:52.868 --> 06:15:52.878 align:start position:0%
into action um I would also point out
 
06:15:55.110 --> 06:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
that you know as we think about
 
06:15:58.350 --> 06:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
batteries uh The Battery Technology of
 
06:16:00.350 --> 06:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
today is not the Battery Technology
 
06:16:03.468 --> 06:16:03.478 align:start position:0%
we're going to see in a few years the in
 
06:16:06.750 --> 06:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
terms of energy it seems that the
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
fastest technological change is
 
06:16:10.990 --> 06:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
happening in batteries the batteries
 
06:16:12.548 --> 06:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
that I just put in my house two weeks
 
06:16:15.030 --> 06:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
ago are going to be obsolete in a few
 
06:16:17.230 --> 06:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
years because of the improvements right
 
06:16:18.708 --> 06:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be lithium ion it's
 
06:16:20.510 --> 06:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to be solid state it's going to be
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
iron and I think it would be really good
 
06:16:26.350 --> 06:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
for the for the state to actually be
 
06:16:30.628 --> 06:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
ahead of this and and be able to
 
06:16:33.190 --> 06:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
understand where batteries are going so
 
06:16:36.030 --> 06:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
that we can have reliable storage and
 
06:16:38.750 --> 06:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
reliable energy so I'm going to be
 
06:16:41.868 --> 06:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
voting against the motion and I actually
 
06:16:44.510 --> 06:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:48.468 --> 06:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
06:16:54.270 --> 06:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I I'd have to Echo
 
06:16:56.190 --> 06:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
what uh my colleague representative
 
06:17:00.310 --> 06:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
Corman just said and also say that if we
 
06:17:05.468 --> 06:17:05.478 align:start position:0%
if we um opted to move sp54 forward then
 
06:17:07.708 --> 06:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
we would not have to move forward
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
Senator aar's Bill that would be
 
06:17:11.310 --> 06:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
modified to only storage because it
 
06:17:13.990 --> 06:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be covered I think in some of the
 
06:17:16.628 --> 06:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
questions that we're asking here that be
 
06:17:19.830 --> 06:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
um responded to in this department of
 
06:17:19.840 --> 06:17:20.990 align:start position:0%
um responded to in this department of
energy

06:17:20.990 --> 06:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:17:23.990 --> 06:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
investigation um this also goes into
 
06:17:27.390 --> 06:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
things like regulatory changes and
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
challenges with the utilities and what
 
06:17:30.990 --> 06:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
it does is it prompts us to have the
 
06:17:32.590 --> 06:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
kind of conversations that we need to
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
have to get to the infr infastructure
 
06:17:37.708 --> 06:17:37.718 align:start position:0%
changes that would be needed to support
 
06:17:40.350 --> 06:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
adoption of of renewable energy sources
 
06:17:44.230 --> 06:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
so so these things are I look at them as
 
06:17:47.350 --> 06:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
impediments um to the Investments that
 
06:17:48.868 --> 06:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
people would be making if they had the
 
06:17:51.350 --> 06:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions so I I really
 
06:17:53.788 --> 06:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
do think it is it is incumbent upon us
 
06:17:55.948 --> 06:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
to at least investigate those things and
 
06:17:58.510 --> 06:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
get those answers so we know uh how to
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
move forward I I think a lot of the
 
06:18:05.628 --> 06:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
again impediments um that need to be
 
06:18:09.430 --> 06:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
removed are in the realm of upcoming
 
06:18:11.590 --> 06:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
technology and things that we don't
 
06:18:13.628 --> 06:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
understand and I think this bill covers
 
06:18:15.510 --> 06:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
both of those and I think we we kind of
 
06:18:17.948 --> 06:18:17.958 align:start position:0%
owe it to our constituents to get more
 
06:18:20.548 --> 06:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge on it so we can make better
 
06:18:23.750 --> 06:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
bills representative licki thank you Mr
 
06:18:27.468 --> 06:18:27.478 align:start position:0%
chairman um my personal background is in
 
06:18:31.990 --> 06:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the electronics Industry for starting in
 
06:18:35.070 --> 06:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
1966 and for every part of that time The
 
06:18:36.788 --> 06:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
Good batteries were always right around
 
06:18:38.788 --> 06:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
the corner and they still are we've made
 
06:18:42.310 --> 06:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
incremental improvements we did NAD um
 
06:18:43.788 --> 06:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
and replaced some lead acid we did
 
06:18:45.628 --> 06:18:45.638 align:start position:0%
nickel metal hydride was another
 
06:18:47.708 --> 06:18:47.718 align:start position:0%
technology that was a little bit better
 
06:18:50.270 --> 06:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
lithium ion is significantly better
 
06:18:52.910 --> 06:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
however none of them are the revolution
 
06:18:57.468 --> 06:18:57.478 align:start position:0%
that we've been promised for 60 some
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.548 --> 06:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thanks Mr chairman I this is
 
06:19:07.590 --> 06:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a general question since I'm
 
06:19:10.390 --> 06:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
still fairly new here is why do we have
 
06:19:13.868 --> 06:19:13.878 align:start position:0%
to write laws to do something like this
 
06:19:15.628 --> 06:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
I mean can't somebody just ask the
 
06:19:18.350 --> 06:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy to do this I mean
 
06:19:20.390 --> 06:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
we we seem to write laws I mean the last
 
06:19:21.708 --> 06:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
thing we were talking about was
 
06:19:24.270 --> 06:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
basically a law to tell the department
 
06:19:27.788 --> 06:19:27.798 align:start position:0%
of energy to make a plan to have a plan
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
I mean you know anyway um so this to me
 
06:19:35.708 --> 06:19:35.718 align:start position:0%
just looks unnecessary
 
06:19:35.718 --> 06:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
just looks unnecessary
representative

06:19:37.190 --> 06:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:19:39.708 --> 06:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah well we keep the term
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
gets used in here quite a bit utility
 
06:19:44.230 --> 06:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
scale uh I'm not quite sure what's meant
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
by that but I'm assuming it means
 
06:19:48.030 --> 06:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
something to do with the utilities so is
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
this are we going back to the pre
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
structuring days when now we're going to
 
06:19:55.990 --> 06:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
have utilities putting up huge uh uh
 
06:19:58.150 --> 06:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
battery storage facilities and basically
 
06:19:59.510 --> 06:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
getting back into the generation
 
06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
business to some extent they going to be
 
06:20:03.150 --> 06:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
buying power and putting it in there is
 
06:20:04.948 --> 06:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
the next step they'll be producing their
 
06:20:07.390 --> 06:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
own power to store their batteries with
 
06:20:09.350 --> 06:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that's a major change in our
 
06:20:11.190 --> 06:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
philosophy of allowing markets to do
 
06:20:12.830 --> 06:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
this I think the best people for
 
06:20:15.548 --> 06:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
pursuing modate Advanced Technologies
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
are the people willing to spend their
 
06:20:18.990 --> 06:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
own money on it whether they be private
 
06:20:20.670 --> 06:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
individuals or the utilities well you
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
don't need the state to try to steer
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
them in the right direction because let
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
be quite honest we don't know exactly
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
what that direction is someone who de
 
06:20:31.830 --> 06:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
deals in that business day after day and
 
06:20:33.390 --> 06:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
knows all the ins and outs of it is the
 
06:20:35.110 --> 06:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
one I want making those decisions ISS
 
06:20:36.628 --> 06:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
not not a bunch of people sitting around
 
06:20:39.310 --> 06:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
their desk in this
 
06:20:39.320 --> 06:20:40.990 align:start position:0%
their desk in this
room

06:20:40.990 --> 06:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
room
 
06:20:43.350 --> 06:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman um I think
 
06:20:48.390 --> 06:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative Kennedy and and
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Heron can make some some
 
06:20:53.150 --> 06:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
good points um as well as as my
 
06:20:56.190 --> 06:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues representative Corman um and
 
06:21:00.390 --> 06:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
ranking member McGee but I I think that
 
06:21:00.400 --> 06:21:01.230 align:start position:0%
ranking member McGee but I I think that
the

06:21:01.230 --> 06:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:04.990 --> 06:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
approach that we need and the department
 
06:21:08.110 --> 06:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
of energy if we ask them to undertake a
 
06:21:11.310 --> 06:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
study here they don't need to become
 
06:21:13.150 --> 06:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
experts they shouldn't actually concern
 
06:21:15.468 --> 06:21:15.478 align:start position:0%
themselves very much with becoming
 
06:21:18.150 --> 06:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
experts on technology or Arbiters of
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
Technology what is good and what is bad
 
06:21:25.150 --> 06:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
Etc uh what our department of energy and
 
06:21:26.990 --> 06:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know our Public Utilities Commission
 
06:21:31.150 --> 06:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
have dominion over is the role that
 
06:21:35.708 --> 06:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
storage may play in uh um enhancing
 
06:21:38.350 --> 06:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
reliability and decreasing costs for all
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
rate payers and that would be the the
 
06:21:42.830 --> 06:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
rules and the
 
06:21:46.190 --> 06:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
incentives under which energy storage
 
06:21:48.750 --> 06:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
could play in the New Hampshire Market
 
06:21:51.708 --> 06:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
that is our responsibility and their
 
06:21:53.548 --> 06:21:53.558 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I think it would be
 
06:21:56.948 --> 06:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
useful to have them get up to speed on
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
things like you know time of use rates
 
06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:22:05.230 --> 06:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
other other aspects of you know the
 
06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
evolution of the grid and the role that
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
storage can
 
06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
play we should get more up to speed on
 
06:22:13.708 --> 06:22:13.718 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to you know worry
 
06:22:15.310 --> 06:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
about what the technology is what the
 
06:22:17.070 --> 06:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
best technology is as representative
 
06:22:18.590 --> 06:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
Harrington says the market will take
 
06:22:21.670 --> 06:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
care of that but right now New Hampshire
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
has sort of
 
06:22:27.990 --> 06:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
no um we nowhere in terms of inviting
 
06:22:31.150 --> 06:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
you know innovation in the market um
 
06:22:32.750 --> 06:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
because those there's no recognition of
 
06:22:34.948 --> 06:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
storage in our rates or
 
06:22:37.670 --> 06:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
anything else so that's what I would
 
06:22:40.548 --> 06:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
say representative
 
06:22:42.990 --> 06:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
Kennedy yeah as I understand the
 
06:22:45.190 --> 06:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy is not a very old
 
06:22:48.030 --> 06:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
department so I mean does it have a
 
06:22:50.270 --> 06:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
mission statement or something you know
 
06:22:53.430 --> 06:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
I I used to think that laws were general
 
06:22:56.270 --> 06:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know you would have a you know a
 
06:22:57.990 --> 06:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
department or whatever and you know
 
06:23:00.070 --> 06:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
maybe a few pages about what it is
 
06:23:02.350 --> 06:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do and then once in
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
a while you know I guess you could have
 
06:23:05.310 --> 06:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
some kind of revie view or whatever but
 
06:23:08.310 --> 06:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
we seem to want to write down exactly
 
06:23:11.030 --> 06:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
what we want all these departments to do
 
06:23:15.750 --> 06:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know and and we lack expertise so I
 
06:23:18.030 --> 06:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
would think that you know the department
 
06:23:19.590 --> 06:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I would think if the department
 
06:23:21.390 --> 06:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
of energy is not doing this kind of
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing then it's not doing its job or we
 
06:23:29.430 --> 06:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.390 --> 06:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
enough well I'd like to make a few
 
06:23:33.468 --> 06:23:33.478 align:start position:0%
comments about this bill I see five
 
06:23:35.430 --> 06:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
major problems with this
 
06:23:39.070 --> 06:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill the first one is it costs $250,000
 
06:23:42.910 --> 06:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
to rate payers which may not seem like a
 
06:23:46.030 --> 06:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
lot of money but when you keep adding
 
06:23:49.190 --> 06:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
250,000 here and 250,000 there and
 
06:23:53.948 --> 06:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
500,000 there it adds up so I don't
 
06:23:56.708 --> 06:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
really see that it's appropriate for us
 
06:24:00.468 --> 06:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
to be adding to what the citizens of New
 
06:24:02.830 --> 06:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are paying on their electric
 
06:24:06.670 --> 06:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:09.030 --> 06:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
secondly as representative Bernardi
 
06:24:11.948 --> 06:24:11.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned utility scale storage is an
 
06:24:14.868 --> 06:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
ISO no England concern it's not
 
06:24:16.628 --> 06:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
something that the state needs to get
 
06:24:16.638 --> 06:24:18.190 align:start position:0%
something that the state needs to get
involved

06:24:18.190 --> 06:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:24:22.830 --> 06:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
with thirdly this bill for ports to
 
06:24:27.468 --> 06:24:27.478 align:start position:0%
seek out reasons why there are
 
06:24:31.468 --> 06:24:31.478 align:start position:0%
hurdles for the adoption of energy
 
06:24:34.670 --> 06:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
storage well it's pretty clear that the
 
06:24:39.670 --> 06:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
two primary hurdles to the adoption of
 
06:24:42.910 --> 06:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
energy storage are financing paying for
 
06:24:45.868 --> 06:24:45.878 align:start position:0%
it and the materials that are used to
 
06:24:48.190 --> 06:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
build these
 
06:24:50.708 --> 06:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
things why do we need to study that it's
 
06:24:53.548 --> 06:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious what the ma major hurdles
 
06:24:56.670 --> 06:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
are to the adoption of
 
06:24:59.190 --> 06:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
batteries another reason this bill is
 
06:25:01.310 --> 06:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate it's not government's job
 
06:25:04.590 --> 06:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
to encourage investments in anything any
 
06:25:07.150 --> 06:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
kind of Technology it's up to the
 
06:25:08.910 --> 06:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
private sector the people who are
 
06:25:11.350 --> 06:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
actually going to finance this stuff
 
06:25:15.230 --> 06:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
it's up to them to figure out how to
 
06:25:18.070 --> 06:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
make those investments in a way that
 
06:25:20.750 --> 06:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
allows them to enjoy some kind of of a
 
06:25:22.430 --> 06:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
return on their
 
06:25:24.350 --> 06:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
Investments and then the final thing
 
06:25:25.750 --> 06:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's wrong with this
 
06:25:30.350 --> 06:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill is that it's pretty vague its
 
06:25:33.030 --> 06:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirements are pretty vague on line 14
 
06:25:35.150 --> 06:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
on page one for example it says how best
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
to encourage both utility and
 
06:25:39.788 --> 06:25:39.798 align:start position:0%
non-utility investments in energy
 
06:25:42.150 --> 06:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
storage projects what does encourage
 
06:25:45.070 --> 06:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
mean give them a pat on the back give
 
06:25:47.708 --> 06:25:47.718 align:start position:0%
them a a gold star if they figure
 
06:25:47.718 --> 06:25:48.990 align:start position:0%
them a a gold star if they figure
something

06:25:48.990 --> 06:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:25:53.070 --> 06:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
out on line 19 and online 21 it uses the
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
word program but it never
 
06:25:58.350 --> 06:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
defines what kind of a
 
06:26:01.590 --> 06:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
program that
 
06:26:05.350 --> 06:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh they want to to
 
06:26:08.510 --> 06:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
discover practice best practices for or
 
06:26:12.270 --> 06:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
the implementation of on line seven it
 
06:26:13.788 --> 06:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
talks about the department shall
 
06:26:16.750 --> 06:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
investigate ways to
 
06:26:19.350 --> 06:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
facilitate both behind the meter and
 
06:26:22.750 --> 06:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
energy and utility scale storage well
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
facilitation is a public policy and I
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the
 
06:26:30.190 --> 06:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
Departments or government's role in
 
06:26:33.510 --> 06:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
general to be facilitating something
 
06:26:36.310 --> 06:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done and owned by the
 
06:26:40.390 --> 06:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
private sector I I think this bill is is
 
06:26:43.310 --> 06:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary for those reasons
 
06:26:43.320 --> 06:26:44.270 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary for those reasons
and

06:26:44.270 --> 06:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:47.548 --> 06:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
others uh I could go on for a long time
 
06:26:51.430 --> 06:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
about why this bill is no good and I
 
06:26:52.990 --> 06:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
think we should just refer it for
 
06:26:56.430 --> 06:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
interim study and then talk next fall
 
06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
about whether we actually want to look
 
06:27:01.430 --> 06:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
at studying this bill but it's not the
 
06:27:03.270 --> 06:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
kind of Bill that we should be passing
 
06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
06:27:05.120 --> 06:27:06.270 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
representative

06:27:06.270 --> 06:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:27:08.868 --> 06:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
Summers Mr chairman question for you
 
06:27:11.190 --> 06:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
because of those motion those items that
 
06:27:13.350 --> 06:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
you had just spoken would it be would I
 
06:27:16.150 --> 06:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
be out of place to make a motion to
 
06:27:18.948 --> 06:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
recommend itl for this bill instead of
 
06:27:18.958 --> 06:27:20.590 align:start position:0%
recommend itl for this bill instead of
interim

06:27:20.590 --> 06:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
interim
 
06:27:22.708 --> 06:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
study we have a motion on the floor of
 
06:27:24.830 --> 06:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
interim study we would have to vote on
 
06:27:27.590 --> 06:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
that and see what the outcome was
 
06:27:31.868 --> 06:27:31.878 align:start position:0%
first so we will do that representative
 
06:27:31.878 --> 06:27:34.270 align:start position:0%
first so we will do that representative
partiall

06:27:34.270 --> 06:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
partiall
 
06:27:35.510 --> 06:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
you chair and I take every one of your
 
06:27:36.990 --> 06:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
points very seriously I think they're
 
06:27:39.230 --> 06:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
very well considered but at the same
 
06:27:41.310 --> 06:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
time we had House Bill
 
06:27:43.948 --> 06:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
1465 we got a nice little book out of
 
06:27:45.468 --> 06:27:45.478 align:start position:0%
that telling us the direction that
 
06:27:47.708 --> 06:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy should take in the state
 
06:27:50.070 --> 06:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
and yet much of your criticism doesn't
 
06:27:53.830 --> 06:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:56.430 --> 06:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
also as far as you know we're not going
 
06:27:59.510 --> 06:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
to implement it it's out of our Wick to
 
06:28:02.030 --> 06:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh Implement any you don't we're not not
 
06:28:06.430 --> 06:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
paying for it and that did create a
 
06:28:07.948 --> 06:28:07.958 align:start position:0%
significant hole in our budget that's in
 
06:28:09.868 --> 06:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
order to even look at it and it is
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
technology that is
 
06:28:20.830 --> 06:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:24.868 --> 06:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh 1465 I had to oh I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
06:28:26.990 --> 06:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah ask representative Bernardi what
 
06:28:29.390 --> 06:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill that was as the nuclear study was a
 
06:28:30.910 --> 06:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear one which I have similar
 
06:28:33.788 --> 06:28:33.798 align:start position:0%
feelings on I would think so I was I was
 
06:28:36.590 --> 06:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
cu to Garner your opinion on
 
06:28:39.590 --> 06:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
that well the nuclear study bill uh
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
didn't uh spend any money that wasn't
 
06:28:44.990 --> 06:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
already allocated as I
 
06:28:49.788 --> 06:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
recall so um this bill does spend money
 
06:28:53.150 --> 06:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I object to that among other things
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's a fair objection I would
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
agree any further comments any further
 
06:29:01.830 --> 06:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative licki um I'd
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
make a distinction between the nuclear
 
06:29:06.070 --> 06:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill in this bill this bill is
 
06:29:08.270 --> 06:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
projecting that some kind of storage
 
06:29:09.510 --> 06:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's better than what we have today
 
06:29:11.628 --> 06:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
will come to exist we've got the seor
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
nuke we know it puts out power we know
 
06:29:15.990 --> 06:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
that things have moved a long way since
 
06:29:19.590 --> 06:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
NE cook came online and so uh you know
 
06:29:22.070 --> 06:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
on one hand we have the nuclear and I
 
06:29:23.788 --> 06:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
will agree that there's nothing we can
 
06:29:26.150 --> 06:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
do to make nuclear come to New Hampshire
 
06:29:27.628 --> 06:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
however at least we're talking about a
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.468 --> 06:29:33.478 align:start position:0%
proven further discussion representative
 
06:29:33.478 --> 06:29:35.270 align:start position:0%
proven further discussion representative
MS

06:29:35.270 --> 06:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
MS
 
06:29:37.468 --> 06:29:37.478 align:start position:0%
you know ba based on the strong comments
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
that I've heard on from from both sides
 
06:29:44.270 --> 06:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
of on this bill uh the pros and the cons
 
06:29:46.708 --> 06:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that a motion of inim
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
study is the right motion I I would
 
06:29:51.788 --> 06:29:51.798 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Summers that
 
06:29:55.868 --> 06:29:55.878 align:start position:0%
you know um we should uh we should vote
 
06:29:57.830 --> 06:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
down the interim study motion and then
 
06:30:02.750 --> 06:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:05.110 --> 06:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay okay further discussion
 
06:30:05.120 --> 06:30:07.948 align:start position:0%
bill okay okay further discussion
further

06:30:07.948 --> 06:30:07.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:12.868 --> 06:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:16.510 --> 06:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair uh so uh
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
sort of piggybacking off of what
 
06:30:20.750 --> 06:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative parall said uh you know
 
06:30:22.910 --> 06:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
we created a study commission we looked
 
06:30:28.230 --> 06:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
at nuclear energy um uh you know my
 
06:30:32.070 --> 06:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
initial uh thought on this bill was itl
 
06:30:34.830 --> 06:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
because I thought there's really nothing
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
here in that I believe is going to be of
 
06:30:43.270 --> 06:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
value coming out of uh this work but I
 
06:30:47.270 --> 06:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
said all right there are uh there's a
 
06:30:51.230 --> 06:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
potential for maybe looking at Value
 
06:30:53.948 --> 06:30:53.958 align:start position:0%
associated with batteries so we in an
 
06:30:56.750 --> 06:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
interim study group could pull out those
 
06:31:00.150 --> 06:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
things which are truly under State
 
06:31:03.310 --> 06:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
Control not ISO New England control and
 
06:31:03.320 --> 06:31:04.868 align:start position:0%
Control not ISO New England control and
potentially

06:31:04.868 --> 06:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
06:31:09.990 --> 06:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh Advance those efforts but similar to
 
06:31:11.868 --> 06:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
like the report that was put out on
 
06:31:14.350 --> 06:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear we could put out a mini report
 
06:31:17.030 --> 06:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
or have one done on where what the
 
06:31:19.948 --> 06:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
status of battery is if if that's an
 
06:31:22.270 --> 06:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
option going forward hence the motion
 
06:31:26.628 --> 06:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
for interim study but um you know again
 
06:31:29.388 --> 06:31:29.398 align:start position:0%
my my thrust would be if left my own
 
06:31:35.468 --> 06:31:35.478 align:start position:0%
devices i' itl this uh but I want to be
 
06:31:38.070 --> 06:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
open and inviting to those that think
 
06:31:39.948 --> 06:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
there's some Merit here to at least pull
 
06:31:44.110 --> 06:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:46.388 --> 06:31:46.398 align:start position:0%
Merit representative
 
06:31:48.830 --> 06:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah thank you I have to agree
 
06:31:50.150 --> 06:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
with representative bernardy I think
 
06:31:51.910 --> 06:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
there there is potential Merit in
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
looking at battery storage and and there
 
06:31:56.230 --> 06:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
might be flaws with this bill uh but I
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
think the intent is is valuable and if
 
06:32:01.430 --> 06:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about grid reliability
 
06:32:02.468 --> 06:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
and I know that's something that we're
 
06:32:04.830 --> 06:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
concerned with uh we know that battery
 
06:32:06.350 --> 06:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
storage can help with that we know it's
 
06:32:08.388 --> 06:32:08.398 align:start position:0%
going to be part of transitioning to
 
06:32:09.910 --> 06:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and
 
06:32:12.750 --> 06:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
so there are definitely ways we can look
 
06:32:15.230 --> 06:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
to make uh our state more amable to
 
06:32:17.548 --> 06:32:17.558 align:start position:0%
Bringing more of of battery storage on
 
06:32:18.948 --> 06:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
whether that's behind the meter or
 
06:32:21.070 --> 06:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
utility scale even though utility scale
 
06:32:23.708 --> 06:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
is ISO New England um I don't think it's
 
06:32:25.868 --> 06:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
beyond uh the remit of our department of
 
06:32:27.910 --> 06:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
energy be looking at ways to bring that
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
on that's to the benefit of our
 
06:32:31.548 --> 06:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
constituents so yeah i' would be in
 
06:32:33.388 --> 06:32:33.398 align:start position:0%
favor of of at least looking at interm
 
06:32:34.670 --> 06:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
study for
 
06:32:38.750 --> 06:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:40.750 --> 06:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
comments okay seeing none I'm going to
 
06:32:42.590 --> 06:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role on the
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
question of the adoption of the motion
 
06:32:48.030 --> 06:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
of refer for interim study on Senate
 
06:32:48.040 --> 06:32:50.910 align:start position:0%
of refer for interim study on Senate
