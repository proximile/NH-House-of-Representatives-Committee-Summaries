did get exec by its subcommittee but
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're it's on there just to make sure we

excluding those informational
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
sessions from these meetings I'm not
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
sure what the committee feels about that
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
I'm just poting out those are things
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
that the the board should not need to
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
have a time frame in which to to have
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
those discussions I don't particularly
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
have an opinion on it I'm just pointing
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
out that it does more than just the
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
notice okay I don't know what the
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee thinks but any other concerns
 
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:12.629 align:start position:0%
committee thinks but any other concerns
about

00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
the I had down on my notes it kind of
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
came down to the urgency if there was
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
something that they needed to deal with
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
five days notice would be a lot better
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
window if they had an emergency rather
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
than 10 days notice that's kind of what
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
it came down to and and we also had
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
words that said that um uh they can post
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%

00:39:01.309 --> 00:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
you you want to write the blur but I'll
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
tell you I I'm I'm having the blur
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
written up for me because uh what I want
 
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
everyone to know and certainly I know
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's people in the audience who care
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
very much about how this is how this is
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
going down is that what the issue is
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
that ambulances or either if they're a
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
if they're in network or not have not
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
signed a network contract so what we're
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
going to say is that in either case the
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
insurance company uh will send the check
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
directly to the ambulance company
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
however that differential between
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
whether they're in network whether they
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
have a contract or not will be a um that
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
would be determined by the insurance
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
company as terms of what they're going
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
to send that check is going to be um and
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
the caveat is that um if if so if a uh
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
an ambulance is has not signed a
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
contract is not in the network
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
um is going to get a check that's going
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
to be theoretically lower than the check
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
they would have gotten if they did sign
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
a contract they still will be allowed to
 
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.150 align:start position:0%
a contract they still will be allowed to
balance

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
Bill and we're going to write this in
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
the blur so that everybody knows balance
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
disappearing yes I have in my notes that
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
it needs an amendment so can we clarify
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
that please so we were going to we were
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
trying to think that we need whether we
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
need to write this in the amendment and
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
we don't need to it's just going to be
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the blurb and that
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
has that that has the intent of the
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
legislation we don't we didn't need to
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
clarify this we you know in terms of
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.230 align:start position:0%
 
situation

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay and I think all parties are happy
 
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
resolution put it away neither side is
 
00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
resolution put it away neither side is
is

00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
estatic because this is a
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%

Diagnostic and supplemental breast exams
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're moving uh OTP because uh we feel
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
that this is essential to women's
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
healthare and will actually reduce costs
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yes Heidi you have to come up and
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%

mic

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
mic
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman I'm sorry to
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
interrupt your executive uh session I
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention that the
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
effective date with mandates we
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
typically try to have those be January
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
1st of whatever the upcoming year is so
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if that effective date
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
could be what is the effective date the
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
effective date I believe as drafted was
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
60 days after passage rather than
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
January 1 we don't want that J rather
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
than January 1st of 2025 okay so why
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't we put this off to next week and
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
then and we'll get that done
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay so uh you're okay with withdrawing
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
your motion yes I withdraw my motion
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right uh next up how
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
chairman hun yes I had that it needed a
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is that not true anymore so
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes is something that really
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
has to happen before the process begins
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it's really a decision of the
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
department that that the legislation
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be referred to to generate that
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal Noe okay that in this case it
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
would say that there really is no direct
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
expense to um to taxpayers that it would
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
only uh it's only potential expense is
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to be into to Insurance um if we
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
decided that that was going to be a very
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
dramatic effect that that really has
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
effect we do have the right to interim
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
study the bill and send it to the
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department to have them do a
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal study which does cost money to do
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
that study but that would study would
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
then come back with what their analysis
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%

that shouldn't be raising a hand over
 
03:31:51.309 --> 03:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
there Ammon Cole hunt Mair Gibbs and
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.670 --> 03:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right HB 1117 Rel to creating a
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
committee to study the protection of
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
business operators against requests to
 
03:32:08.150 --> 03:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
accommodate customers with fraudulent or
 
03:32:11.309 --> 03:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
untrained service
 
03:32:14.830 --> 03:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
animals do we really want to create a
 
03:32:14.840 --> 03:32:17.429 align:start position:0%
animals do we really want to create a
committee

03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
well I mean it's definitely needed this
 
03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:26.429 --> 03:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
room there's probably a few because the
 
03:32:37.389 --> 03:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
question well my feeling is and actually
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're probably the best person to
 
03:32:42.030 --> 03:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
answer this repr gives okay my feeling
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
is that any business should be able to
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
decide decide whether they're going to
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
allow a dog or not they should just be
 
03:32:54.550 --> 03:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
allowed now I understand there is
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
federal legislation regulated to you
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
know handicap you know people have so if
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
we were to say is if that that hotel
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
owner was um going to Bar a deaf person
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
to bring a dog
 
03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
in you know I I'm pretty sure that they
 
03:33:19.110 --> 03:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't okay the issue is that when
 
03:33:21.189 --> 03:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
people show up with these service
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
animals if we were to say the New
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute is clear you're not
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
that service animal is not a service dog
 
03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's illegal and if you want to pursue a
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
case you'll have to pursue it in federal
 
03:33:39.550 --> 03:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
court unfortunately for that proposal
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
there is State legislation as well so
 
03:33:43.630 --> 03:33:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's not going to work so what's in in
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
the state legisl what's in the state
 
03:33:48.990 --> 03:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
current state law that's not making not
 
03:33:49.000 --> 03:33:50.750 align:start position:0%
current state law that's not making not
working

03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:33:53.349 --> 03:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
well as you said it's it's something of
 
03:33:57.150 --> 03:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
an unsolvable problem but you cannot
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people with
 
03:34:01.150 --> 03:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities so if it's a genuine
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
service dog and it's not allowed and in
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
fact there's a separate statute that
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
relates specifically to guide dogs um
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
which apply to both deaf and blind
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
people state state law state law okay um
 
03:34:16.990 --> 03:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
so that's really not not going to work
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
um do we have a state law that says that
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
service dogs are not
 
03:34:25.150 --> 03:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
considered companion dog Comfort dog
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
Comfort dog Comfort dog okay com com
 
03:34:31.469 --> 03:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
Comfort dog okay Comfort companion dog
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
do we have a law saying that a hotel
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
owner can refuse a companion dog the law
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
is the book we don't have anything
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
specifically about that but one could
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
argue that it companion dog is not a
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
service dog if it's a service dog it has
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be allowed I understand service dog
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
okay I mean I understand the DEA and and
 
03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
I mean I in in my mind it was it was
 
03:34:58.590 --> 03:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
originally a blind and it was DEA and
 
03:35:02.189 --> 03:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
there's actually um insulin the dogs who
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
can smell the diabetes okay th those are
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
the three also uh epilepsy and epilepsy
 
03:35:14.349 --> 03:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
okay so in terms of when people if if a
 
03:35:16.830 --> 03:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
land if a hotel owner says no I'm not
 
03:35:18.990 --> 03:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
going to rent the room to you to a comp
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
because because of the companion because
 
03:35:22.750 --> 03:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's a companion dog turn your mic on
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
please my mic is on so I'm not going to
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
rent to you because your dog is just a
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
companion dog but they do that all the
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
time that's their decision and they and
 
03:35:36.269 --> 03:35:36.279 align:start position:0%
they' make that decision with a risk
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that they could get
 
03:35:42.750 --> 03:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
sued and they say to the to the to the
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
the rent the the guest you want to sue
 
03:35:48.670 --> 03:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
us go ahead but I'm not going to rent
 
03:35:51.150 --> 03:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
you as the law stands they may be able
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
to do that I I would not you know put my
 
03:35:57.189 --> 03:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
hand down and swear to it they may be
 
03:35:59.630 --> 03:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
able to do that I would not be in favor
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
of actually putting something in statute
 
03:36:04.990 --> 03:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
saying that they could do it no to do to
 
03:36:08.910 --> 03:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
Sue sorry what what to Sue or not to sue
 
03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
yes yeah come on I wouldn't be in favor
 
03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
of saying they could refuse no I think
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
as it stands they probably can refuse if
 
03:36:19.870 --> 03:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
it's a companion animal rather than a
 
03:36:21.990 --> 03:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
service animal and the Same by the way
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
under federal law federal law does not
 
03:36:27.389 --> 03:36:27.399 align:start position:0%
protect companion animals except in
 
03:36:30.429 --> 03:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
housing in housing the landlord cannot
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
refuse a companion animal if the if the
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
animal um provides um assistance based
 
03:36:43.309 --> 03:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
on um uh psychiatric need um that is
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's not just a companion animal it's a
 
03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
comfort an
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
for psychiatric need but that would not
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
apply to public accommod PSD dog yeah
 
03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
yes that would not apply to public
 
03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
accommodations so I think under for
 
03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
public accommodations they probably can
 
03:37:00.429 --> 03:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
refuse an animal that is not a service
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
animal does that make sense I would not
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
however be in favor of actually putting
 
03:37:08.710 --> 03:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
that into statutory language I think
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's okay as it
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
stands so tell us what you hope this
 
03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee is going to solve so so I
 
03:37:17.469 --> 03:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
think what this bill did was created a
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
study committee originally correct and
 
03:37:22.189 --> 03:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
we had encour we generally don't like I
 
03:37:24.510 --> 03:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
know you don't as you can see just in
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
this three minutes this is a very
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and it really has
 
03:37:29.349 --> 03:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
become an enormous problem for
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
businesses but to just back up a second
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
so technically a business uh can refuse
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
to have an animal come into the building
 
03:37:39.150 --> 03:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
where they run the risk is if it is a
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
legitimate service animal they then face
 
03:37:45.150 --> 03:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
fines penalties Etc from the Ada right
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
so person okay so let let just stop
 
03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
right there so they they risk that's
 
03:37:54.269 --> 03:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
right they risk that yes okay so uh that
 
03:37:58.469 --> 03:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
means that the the person the the guest
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
has to drop a dime to correct to hurt
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
hurt your old Department would they
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
would you take those to my old
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
Department uh or the Federal Department
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
of Justice which enforces the Ada
 
03:38:14.750 --> 03:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
correct okay yes right so if the hotel
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
owners calling that person's
 
03:38:21.150 --> 03:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
Bluff and said okay fine give them a
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
call right which happens from time to
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
time and as as I shared with you the uh
 
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
the example when I testified there was
 
03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
an incident um I think it was last
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
summer where somebody came to a
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant claimed it was a service
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
animal clearly was not a service animal
 
03:38:38.349 --> 03:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
it was yippy and jumpy and all that
 
03:38:40.189 --> 03:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
stuff which you know business owners we
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
can usually tell pretty much right away
 
03:38:43.389 --> 03:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're a legitimate
 
03:38:45.630 --> 03:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
service animal or not that person person
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
said if you don't let me in I'm calling
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
the police the business owner said let
 
03:38:50.349 --> 03:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
me give you my our phone let we'll help
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
you call the police the police came they
 
03:38:54.750 --> 03:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
issued the citation um and there is in
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute right now I think
 
03:38:58.870 --> 03:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's a $1,000 $1,200 penalty for
 
03:39:01.070 --> 03:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting a service animal except
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
that there's no teeth to it because it's
 
03:39:04.349 --> 03:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
un enforceable nobody will enforce it
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's a civil matter so this is where we
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
go down to this whole Rabbit Hole of
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
well how do we give it some teeth to
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
where when it there legitimately is not
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
a service animal that the business owner
 
03:39:16.349 --> 03:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
has some recourse or there is some
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
penalty that would be paid by the uh
 
03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:20.670 align:start position:0%
penalty that would be paid by the uh
misrepresenting

03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
party so you want okay so when that law
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer showed up you said
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
he wrote or she wrote a citation I think
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
technically they just filled out a
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
report I don't think they made any
 
03:39:35.710 --> 03:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
determination report now what what
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
becomes so at that moment could the uh
 
03:39:42.750 --> 03:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
restaurer say to the law enforcement I
 
03:39:45.790 --> 03:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
um I think they have violated the stat
 
03:39:47.710 --> 03:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to force this dog on
 
03:39:50.110 --> 03:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
me when I you don't have to which this
 
03:39:52.229 --> 03:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
business did this business also had
 
03:39:53.790 --> 03:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
signs posted in the window we do not
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
allow anything but service animals right
 
03:39:57.790 --> 03:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
um but then was followed up with
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
subsequently with um you know uh demand
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
letters from this person's attorney
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
saying if you don't send us $30,000
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
within the next 90 days we're going to
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
take you to court we're going to do this
 
03:40:09.189 --> 03:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to do so now he has to
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
engage an attorney so now he has all
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
these additional expenses and at the end
 
03:40:13.950 --> 03:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
of the day the Battle of attorneys yeah
 
03:40:15.790 --> 03:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
those people because that we all knew
 
03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
from the start this was not a legitimate
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
service animal of course that whole
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
claim went radio silent but that doesn't
 
03:40:22.590 --> 03:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
absolve the poor business owner from
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
having to go through that entire process
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
no he didn't have to he could have
 
03:40:27.070 --> 03:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
dropped the case just as much as the
 
03:40:29.469 --> 03:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
other person dropped the case right sure
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
but usually you don't know who that
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
individual is right you just have an
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
well I guess I I was just looking at the
 
03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:36.630 align:start position:0%
well I guess I I was just looking at the
real

03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
real
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
world saying is that that if someone
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
showed up and and I Can See Clearly this
 
03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
is this is you know not a service dog
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
and say no I refuse to serve you and the
 
03:40:49.950 --> 03:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
person say I want to call the police and
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
say well fine but at this point would
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
you please exit my establishment and go
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
call the police do whatever you want to
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
do and we'll take it from there and then
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
that person would you know obviously
 
03:41:04.750 --> 03:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
walk down the street not byother the
 
03:41:07.070 --> 03:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
call police but if they actually did and
 
03:41:10.990 --> 03:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
the police showed up then the uh the
 
03:41:12.790 --> 03:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner could
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
say you know uh I
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
could look at the other the know
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that other person is still
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
sitting there and say I will uh if they
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't make you know drop this accusation
 
03:41:29.910 --> 03:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
I will pursue this other counter case
 
03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
which is that you're violating and then
 
03:41:33.229 --> 03:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
I would think at that point in time the
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
person say okay let's Let It Go Walk
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
Away I I I guess I'm just wondering is
 
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:41.080 align:start position:0%
because this is so un enforcable because
 
03:41:44.189 --> 03:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
we have no vehicle to solve this in
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
terms of law enforcement
 
03:41:47.309 --> 03:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't want to get involved in
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
it in either way nobody wants any part
 
03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
of this to be perfectly honest with you
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the challenge and so
 
03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
therefore I mean we can create a study
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee but I just don't know what's
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to come out of the study committee
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
and I think where the rub for the
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
business owner is so if they do all of
 
03:42:02.830 --> 03:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
the things you just suggest right which
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
I think would be the logical progression
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
you would follow right at the end of
 
03:42:07.870 --> 03:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
that discussion we still don't
 
03:42:10.389 --> 03:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a name address or any
 
03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
identifying factors of this individual
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
that we could then uh pursue a case with
 
03:42:17.710 --> 03:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
anyway right Mr chairman order do you
 
03:42:20.110 --> 03:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
want to pursue the case Mr chairman yes
 
03:42:22.510 --> 03:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you um okay
 
03:42:24.429 --> 03:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
in the first place there's nothing the
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
police could do on either side of a
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
claim like that the police have no
 
03:42:30.030 --> 03:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority criminal correct
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
so calling the police would not do
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
either side any good um in the second
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
place the claim for $30,000 was
 
03:42:40.110 --> 03:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
obviously not going to go anywhere and
 
03:42:45.510 --> 03:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
as you say it it did not uh so I think
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
we could write all kinds of new
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and it would still come down
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
to is this a service animal or not and
 
03:42:54.149 --> 03:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
unless you're
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
actually um you know on site or um the
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
um uh person with the dog had some kind
 
03:43:08.389 --> 03:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
of paperwork which mostly doesn't exist
 
03:43:11.149 --> 03:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
um it would be very difficult to decide
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
now the person denied could bring a
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
claim to the Human Rights Commission or
 
03:43:19.550 --> 03:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
to um the uh federal department of
 
03:43:22.110 --> 03:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
justice under the Ada but if it's not a
 
03:43:24.389 --> 03:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
service animal that claim will not go
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
anywhere the thing of it is there is no
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
such thing and I I am a lawyer as it
 
03:43:31.750 --> 03:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
happens um although I'm only uh licensed
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
to practice in Massachusetts um uh
 
03:43:37.469 --> 03:43:37.479 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as a self-
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
enforcing law you can't enforce it by
 
03:43:43.590 --> 03:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
saying Oh no you're you're wrong you
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
know pay the fine you pretty much always
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
have to go to some agency or to court so
 
03:43:52.830 --> 03:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
if the person is
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
lying um and there's a statute which
 
03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
says it's illegal to falsely claim that
 
03:44:03.309 --> 03:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
that an animal the service animal then
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
you can take that person to court under
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
that statute if the P if the if the
 
03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
um uh animal is a service animal then
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
the person who brought the animal can go
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
either as I said to the Department of
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
Justice or uh to the Human Rights
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
Commission or both uh but that's how it
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
would have to work and I don't think
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
there's any additional legislation which
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
is going to help it represent m l ju
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
just a quick question if if a service
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
dog is trained don't they get some sort
 
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
of a a designation a certificate they
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't they do not and there is no
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority there is no like
 
03:44:44.269 --> 03:44:44.279 align:start position:0%
official papers that you have to be
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
issued there is nothing
 
03:44:47.790 --> 03:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
that would solve the problem it would
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
but it would be a federal issue but
 
03:44:51.030 --> 03:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
there would have to be an agency that
 
03:44:53.469 --> 03:44:53.479 align:start position:0%
was authorized to issue the paperwork
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
either on a state or federal level and
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:02.149 --> 03:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
authorized right so ultimately where the
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
business owner ends up falling is if you
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
have a legitimate service animal and you
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
are denied service right there is a
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
recourse for that individual but as the
 
03:45:12.510 --> 03:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
business owner there is no
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
recourse well if if
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
I can't say much for the restaurant but
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
most restaurants they usually have your
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
name and your phone
 
03:45:23.309 --> 03:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
number you know when you make a res
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
small percentage of restaurants take
 
03:45:25.870 --> 03:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
reservations most of them it's first
 
03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
come first serve so you but a hotel
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
would know a hotel would know
 
03:45:33.070 --> 03:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
potentially yes okay so but I I guess
 
03:45:34.670 --> 03:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
what do you think could come out of the
 
03:45:36.750 --> 03:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
study committee I was leaving it to the
 
03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
really smart people in the room to come
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
back and tell me what could come out of
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
it we just had a good and then and all
 
03:45:44.229 --> 03:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
we could all I would say you know I mean
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
best I can give you interim study and we
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
can talk about this again some more but
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
at this point I I have no brilliant idea
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
other than I would just say you just
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
stare someone down and say okay you
 
03:45:57.389 --> 03:45:57.399 align:start position:0%
really want to go to court over this and
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
really we were just trying to impress on
 
03:46:00.750 --> 03:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
the committee just how much of a problem
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
this has really become for businesses
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
and I would say I am very impressed that
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
problem thank you I just listening to
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
your explanation of that scenario I'll
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
I'll add that I understand that it's a
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
problem as well uh but
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have the solution
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
to that problem I wish I did because
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
it's a problem for people who have
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities and who have genuine
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
service animals because it puts them in
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
a situation of having to argue that it's
 
03:46:32.429 --> 03:46:32.439 align:start position:0%
really a service animal because other
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
people have falsely claimed it correct
 
03:46:38.670 --> 03:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
okay and so uh speak loud and clear I
 
03:46:40.189 --> 03:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw out an idea and I know
 
03:46:42.630 --> 03:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
this might be for later um but in the
 
03:46:44.429 --> 03:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
case where the person with the pet was
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe it is fraudulent could
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees be granted to uh The
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
Establishment if they lose that that
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
would be the idea I'm throwing out there
 
03:47:01.149 --> 03:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
yeah great idea the Florida love yeah I
 
03:47:03.309 --> 03:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
again I think at this point I think um I
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
did the research and sent that
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
collection of information to you folks
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there's any great
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
ideas workable ideas but obviously
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
something like that that gives some
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
teeth to it but ultimately it goes back
 
03:47:14.479 --> 03:47:15.510 align:start position:0%
teeth to it but ultimately it goes back
to

03:47:15.510 --> 03:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:47:17.229 --> 03:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
is it enforcable to representative
 
03:47:18.990 --> 03:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hunt's Point and I'm you know this is
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
where we struggle honestly okay do you
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
have a copy in the bill what so who's on
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
your study
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee no idea yeah do you want to
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
pull it up what do you mean idea you
 
03:47:32.229 --> 03:47:32.239 align:start position:0%
created this wasn't our bill this is
 
03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
brought forward independent of us we're
 
03:47:34.830 --> 03:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
just here and support of it who who
 
03:47:38.309 --> 03:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill it one second pull it
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%

me

03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%

03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.710 --> 03:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
committees see I want to see who who
 
03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
they appoint is it a legislative study
 
03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%

03:48:10.880 --> 03:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
committee or does it get everybody in
his

03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:13.760 --> 03:48:16.269 align:start position:0%
 
brother

03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
brother
 
03:48:19.189 --> 03:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay three members of the House three
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate good luck for that
 
03:48:21.120 --> 03:48:26.710 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate good luck for that
showing

03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.670 --> 03:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
up so should be attorney there do you
 
03:48:30.870 --> 03:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
really want to to study kidding me or
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
you want to have hope that this Commerce
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
Committee can work this come up with a
 
03:48:38.990 --> 03:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
solution come September I leave it in
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.030 --> 03:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
sir okay that means you're TR you trust
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
that this committee can will come up
 
03:48:52.309 --> 03:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
with some way to to make the legal
 
03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
oblig if we could pass that it would
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
need to go to Judiciary if we did that
 
03:49:00.149 --> 03:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
we I the business Community particularly
 
03:49:01.870 --> 03:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality sector would be
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
appreciative of any support or help we
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
can get right so you would so that the
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant would be able to to stare the
 
03:49:10.110 --> 03:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
person in the eye and say by the way if
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
I have to pursue this case against you
 
03:49:15.149 --> 03:49:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh and I win I get the Le we're we're
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
going to get the legal fees are you
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
really want to pursue this right so um I
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
will say that um uh Department of Health
 
03:49:25.030 --> 03:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh food safety actually worked and
 
03:49:27.309 --> 03:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
generated a whole bunch of posters with
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
language that was developed I think by
 
03:49:30.110 --> 03:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice around this
 
03:49:31.870 --> 03:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
whole issue right uh We've helped
 
03:49:33.030 --> 03:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
disseminate them I know they've
 
03:49:34.830 --> 03:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
disseminated them to a bunch of lenses
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
Etc so again they're I think agencies
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
are getting pressure from industry to
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
help them do something um so just
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
recognizing that and and how we move
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
forward I I I don't necessar have a
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
clear answer okay what's it going to be
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
successful so the department you guys
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
want to weigh in and say anything about
 
03:49:51.479 --> 03:49:53.309 align:start position:0%
want to weigh in and say anything about
this

03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:50:02.349 --> 03:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon my name is Colleen
 
03:50:06.469 --> 03:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm the administrator for the food
 
03:50:08.070 --> 03:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
protection section within the Department
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and just to
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
Echo what Mr Summers said is this is a
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
has been a long
 
03:50:17.790 --> 03:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
um ongoing issue with at restaurants
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
grocery stores in particular we receive
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of consumer complaints each
 
03:50:23.510 --> 03:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
year that we have to follow up or
 
03:50:26.590 --> 03:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
patrons see um what's a non-service dog
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
in a food establishment is against our
 
03:50:31.469 --> 03:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
rules um however it's very difficult to
 
03:50:33.309 --> 03:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
enforce we go to follow up on the
 
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
complaint the the the service an or the
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
dog isn't there anymore um we can speak
 
03:50:40.510 --> 03:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
to the managers but it doesn't mean that
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
next time someone enters either a
 
03:50:45.189 --> 03:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
grocery store or a restaurant that that
 
03:50:47.149 --> 03:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
the the situation isn't going to be the
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
same you know it's definitely a lot of
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
pressure especially at a um the entrance
 
03:50:55.510 --> 03:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
of a store for someone to confront a
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
patron they don't want to lose business
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
it um so it's easier just to to you know
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
look away and and um instead of denying
 
03:51:07.070 --> 03:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
that person access when it's not a true
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
service animal and certainly they do
 
03:51:11.710 --> 03:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
post signs we've um participated in
 
03:51:13.630 --> 03:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
disseminating signs that are available
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
through the Secretary of State's website
 
03:51:18.670 --> 03:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
but um you know people can ignore those
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
signs and and unfortunately it it's it
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
seems like it's um only becoming more
 
03:51:26.429 --> 03:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
and more common for this to
 
03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
happen okay
 
03:51:33.309 --> 03:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
any thank you all right um so I I think
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
we should interim study this bill and
 
03:51:37.389 --> 03:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
and we'll take it up in September when
 
03:51:41.229 --> 03:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
we can hopefully have figured out a
 
03:51:45.309 --> 03:51:45.319 align:start position:0%

okay all
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
right onward and upward all right 1395
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
lives a home heating oil and propane
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
bills one right this one was the pr
 
03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
bills one right this one was the pr
repricing

03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
repricing
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
okayer yes just one and that
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
no they're for sale did did did they
 
03:53:19.630 --> 03:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
ever sell the
 
03:53:22.590 --> 03:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
business but is it is it selling
 
03:53:25.149 --> 03:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully coming to
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
happen I mean you think one of the good
 
03:53:30.189 --> 03:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
players is going to buy them out for us
 
03:53:34.030 --> 03:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
us so should we just inter room study
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
and to stay keep an eye on what's
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.030 --> 03:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
this okay yeah R speing to the
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
not according to the notes that I have
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
it was uh a real issue came up around
 
03:53:57.870 --> 03:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the tank being underground being
 
03:54:00.590 --> 03:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
able to get that tank out of there so
 
03:54:03.269 --> 03:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's not workable the way it is anyway
 
03:54:05.469 --> 03:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to do anything we got
 
03:54:06.750 --> 03:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
that right well in that in having a
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
berry underground Berry tank is actually
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
fairly unusual um and and I'm because
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
and I say that because I'm one of those
 
03:54:20.910 --> 03:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
people who who has several and uh and
 
03:54:22.349 --> 03:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
because most people just have above
 
03:54:24.830 --> 03:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
ground tanks unless you're trying to
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
heat your house with propane and then
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
you've kind of serious and and
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
theoretically you're you really have
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
when you do that you're you're selling
 
03:54:36.149 --> 03:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
your soul to that propane you you've got
 
03:54:39.070 --> 03:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
to have hopefully done you know know
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
know what you're getting into with that
 
03:54:40.960 --> 03:54:42.030 align:start position:0%
know what you're getting into with that
propane

03:54:42.030 --> 03:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
propane
 
03:54:44.870 --> 03:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
dealer so
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay interim study people comfortable
 
03:54:55.950 --> 03:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.309 --> 03:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
did second I'm sorry yes I will okay all
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:02.359 --> 03:55:05.309 align:start position:0%
 
study

03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
study
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:09.000 --> 03:55:10.590 align:start position:0%
 
did

03:55:10.590 --> 03:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
1430 electorates approved by the public
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
aties commission for residential
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
condominium property so n and I had a
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
nice conversation with the house clerk
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
about bills going to the right committee
 
03:55:26.830 --> 03:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
and this
 
03:55:30.269 --> 03:55:30.279 align:start position:0%
clearly this we're not this is somewhat
 
03:55:32.469 --> 03:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to come to this committee
 
03:55:35.269 --> 03:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
but that we have become uh by default
 
03:55:39.229 --> 03:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
the condo committee uh and I've uh
 
03:55:41.550 --> 03:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
reminded the house Kirk that we that
 
03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
happened because of we used to have a
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
bills seemingly every year that they
 
03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
were looking for a super lean and uh
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
which is a financial impact of that of
 
03:55:57.990 --> 03:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
condo owners are not paying their their
 
03:56:00.950 --> 03:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
condo fees and the condo association
 
03:56:04.269 --> 03:56:04.279 align:start position:0%
wants to place a lean um we did resolve
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
that issue and then now they do have
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
leans but it's only up to six months of
 
03:56:13.910 --> 03:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
of back payments um but having said that
 
03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
this particular issue uh really should
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
have gone to the energy yeah science and
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
technology and the issue is that if you
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
have common
 
03:56:28.389 --> 03:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
space if then that is a commercial rate
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
so representative spear I'm making a
 
03:56:34.510 --> 03:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
face could tell we received a uh an
 
03:56:36.790 --> 03:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that was pretty nice and
 
03:56:38.429 --> 03:56:38.439 align:start position:0%
addressed a lot of what we were
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about that maybe we could look
 
03:56:41.199 --> 03:56:42.229 align:start position:0%
concerned about that maybe we could look
at

03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
it well I guess I I did not read the
 
03:56:48.349 --> 03:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
amendment too clearly well one of when
 
03:56:51.309 --> 03:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
we discussed it it there was a problem
 
03:56:55.349 --> 03:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
with swimming pools uh some in this
 
03:56:57.630 --> 03:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
particular case it was the so what they
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
did was they took all that out okay and
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment is for septic tanks sewage
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh water supply things that you cannot
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
live in a house
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
without yeah but that's not the problem
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
but that's if they take all that out
 
03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
then maybe we could look at it so what
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
what so they're saying there is
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
something that they should be able to
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
get at a consumer rate yeah what was
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
left uh like I said the things that make
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
it a house they make it a home uh sewage
 
03:57:32.149 --> 03:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
and and water supply that kind of thing
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
right CU that's what the bill was all
 
03:57:34.950 --> 03:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
about was the water it was also for
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
common area swimming pools and stuff
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
like that it was more wide reaching but
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
in particular the problem that he was
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
focused in on is he here is that Mr
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
Swift here oh sponsor okay but that the
 
03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
the the issue that they he was focused
 
03:57:54.070 --> 03:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
in on was their water
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
supply okay so I absolutely know in my
 
03:58:01.389 --> 03:58:01.399 align:start position:0%
town there are houses that have a shared
 
03:58:01.399 --> 03:58:03.309 align:start position:0%
town there are houses that have a shared
water

03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:58:07.189 --> 03:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
supply and they absolutely pay the
 
03:58:07.199 --> 03:58:08.389 align:start position:0%
supply and they absolutely pay the
commercial

03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
rate for that so this bill would not
 
03:58:12.910 --> 03:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
just stop at
 
03:58:15.870 --> 03:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
condos if it would be part of reaching
 
03:58:18.269 --> 03:58:18.279 align:start position:0%
of all across the state of any Community
 
03:58:21.630 --> 03:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
or anybody neighborhood that had a
 
03:58:21.640 --> 03:58:23.710 align:start position:0%
or anybody neighborhood that had a
community

03:58:23.710 --> 03:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
well and that's that is opening a huge
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
worms am
 
03:58:32.159 --> 03:58:34.269 align:start position:0%
worms am
I

03:58:34.269 --> 03:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:58:37.469 --> 03:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
correct my yeah no you just need to talk
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the mic because sorry Manos I'm the
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill um I did um
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
obviously I can't draft an amendment
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a member of the
 
03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
committee but I did send around
 
03:58:52.149 --> 03:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday a suggestion that it' be
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
narrowed strictly to well pumps and um
 
03:59:01.750 --> 03:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh water um which I think I was here at
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing uh before the committee when
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
I introduced the bill and I think that
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
that addresses a lot of what I at least
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
heard as the committee's concerns and I
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
was not understanding your comment chair
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
WP about so it's not the committee
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
because the committee has we're we have
 
03:59:24.269 --> 03:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
no clue about this issue okay what we
 
03:59:27.510 --> 03:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
what we were explained by the
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
department okay and they are saying is
 
03:59:31.120 --> 03:59:32.110 align:start position:0%
department okay and they are saying is

03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
anybody who has a community water
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
service so let's take not condos let's
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
just take home
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
residential if there's six homes
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
and they all share one
 
03:59:52.389 --> 03:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
well that well is build at the
 
03:59:52.399 --> 03:59:53.750 align:start position:0%
well that well is build at the
commercial

03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
03:59:58.030 --> 03:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
rate may I respond yes um the bill is
 
03:59:59.229 --> 03:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
condos however I I heard the concern
 
04:00:04.630 --> 04:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
that perhaps it's in the wrong committee
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to have it referred
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
to science energy and technology and if
 
04:00:11.149 --> 04:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
that's the committee's will I'm
 
04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
perfectly satisfied with that okay
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you were to way beyond
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
that point so you'll just have to
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
reintroduce this bill next year and make
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
sure that you phrase it to make it look
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
like it should go to them and I would
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
say to you what you want to do is don't
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
limit the
 
04:00:32.189 --> 04:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
condos you want to broaden it to anybody
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
who has Community
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%

everything
 
04:00:51.070 --> 04:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%

so thank you members of the committee uh
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
Griffin robers uh State energy program
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
manager at the department of energy um
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
again the department does note its uh
 
04:01:11.469 --> 04:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill it does it as
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
introduced um would present several
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
likely unintended
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
consequences um as we discussed during
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
the public hearing um you are giving a
 
04:01:24.510 --> 04:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
certain subset of commercial entities
 
04:01:26.229 --> 04:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to choose what rate
 
04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
classification they fall under that does
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
not exist for any other entity in the
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
state utilities make that determination
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
based under their rate tariffs approved
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
by the Public Utilities Commission um
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know in this specific instance we
 
04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
have a specific Condo Association that
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
is registered as a COR corporation on
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's website that
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
runs several pumps that it owns and
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
those are charged at a commercial rate
 
04:01:54.550 --> 04:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
because they are in fact a business or
 
04:01:56.710 --> 04:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise now I understand
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
the argument that they serve um private
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
residences and that type of thing um
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the way that the condo
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
association has its billing and they can
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
certainly take it up with utility to
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
change maybe the um the account under
 
04:02:14.110 --> 04:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
the name of the residents but that cont
 
04:02:16.349 --> 04:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
Association owns those pumps and when
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
the condo association is clearly a
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise register with the
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state it is rightly charged
 
04:02:21.920 --> 04:02:23.269 align:start position:0%
secretary of state it is rightly charged

simply says if he if you as a customer
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
called up and said
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%

says fine you know we'll deliver and he
 
04:03:31.229 --> 04:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
says I want to pay by credit card and
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
they going to charge the credit card
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
now if the propane company if you ask
 
04:03:39.990 --> 04:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
the prop or in this particular case the
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
propane only delete delivered on
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%

okay well we're going to deliver it but
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
I can't guarantee you a
 
04:03:55.950 --> 04:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
price then then then all work if we pass
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that basically we're telling
 
04:04:00.630 --> 04:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
the propane dealer don't take the order
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
say call me back on Thursday yeah I
 
04:04:05.790 --> 04:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
thought it was if I order 100 gallons
 
04:04:08.429 --> 04:04:08.439 align:start position:0%
and I give my credit card over the phone
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's that day that the price you get and
 
04:04:14.429 --> 04:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
you would deliver that day yeah after he
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
kept saying he wanted delivery at a
 
04:04:19.389 --> 04:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
different day you can't do
 
04:04:21.550 --> 04:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
that you know what I'm
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
saying it's you got to you you know if
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
you you want a price you want a credit
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
card order this is 100 gallons and and
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
you deliver it as as soon as possible
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's nobody I mean I aren't too many
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
people say I want to deliver a week or
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
two weeks or now but in this particular
 
04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
case the awkwardness of the situation
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
was this propane dealer only delivered
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
to his town once a week so he's at the
 
04:04:51.670 --> 04:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
mercy of whatever that price will be on
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
Thursday yeah and that means that means
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
I would say to them I said don't charge
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
my credit card until Thursday
 
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
correct you know you have that priority
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
but then he can refuse
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
deliver well he wouldn't refuse to deliv
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
he's going to say I I understand I'm
 
04:05:12.670 --> 04:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
going to wait till Thursday and I'm I'm
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
going to be I just this vision of
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
someone you know seeing a price cuz I
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
know on my way to the state house
 
04:05:21.229 --> 04:05:21.239 align:start position:0%

04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
technology I'm trying to remember what
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
what was different about this one
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
representar this was
 
04:06:46.149 --> 04:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
this was kind of limited before they
 
04:06:48.189 --> 04:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
were do the original bill that we had
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
dealt with things like uh washing
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
machines and dryers and everything else
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we had this limited limit is
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
limited to things like computers and
 
04:06:58.590 --> 04:06:58.600 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh I still I know that the industry is
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
moving in the direction of allowing
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
things to be repaired are they you know
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
even apple is they they'll Supply
 
04:07:11.309 --> 04:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
certain Apple's still a sealed box you
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
can't repair anything inside
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
lot of these compies are fighting no no
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
apple actually is doing some stuff where
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
they're doing because there are some
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
laws especially in Europe but the point
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
of it is European governments forcing
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
them to yeah and whatever and and it and
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
because these companies are uh worldwide
 
04:07:34.149 --> 04:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
actually right right uh we're not the
 
04:07:36.670 --> 04:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
only people involved in
 
04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
it I I I still feel that this is a
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
market driven opportunity for companies
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
and not something we should be legisla
 
04:07:46.750 --> 04:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
down at the state level I
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what I
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
think okay anybody else anybody
 
04:08:00.670 --> 04:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
want okay represent spear second by
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
itl all those in favor raise your
 
04:08:09.389 --> 04:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
hand I assume you're going to raise your
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
hand yeah
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
right right six it okay
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%

04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%

so good afternoon members of the
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee my name is Seth Zaraki I'm
 
04:09:18.389 --> 04:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
the general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
04:09:21.950 --> 04:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
banking Department um this is a bill
 
04:09:23.189 --> 04:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
revising the law on the retail
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
installment sales of Motor Vehicles um
 
04:09:27.790 --> 04:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
which is admin this law is administered
 
04:09:29.149 --> 04:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
by the banking Department it will
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
substantially revise um RSA 361a in its
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
entirety really the the main idea of
 
04:09:37.790 --> 04:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is to U modernize that statute
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
to bring it in line with our other
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
statutes it's a rewrite of the whole
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
section um and we worked um in
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
collaboration with um industry experts
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
including the uh New Hampshire Auto
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association in drafting this
 
04:09:49.920 --> 04:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association in drafting this
bill

04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:09:54.670 --> 04:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
um so um happy to answer any questions
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:01.950 --> 04:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
said what does the bill actually do yeah
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
so I I think in general I would
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
characterize it in uh really three ways
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
um so 36 RSA 361a was first enacted over
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
60 years ago um and there have been peac
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
meal amendments to that statute over
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
time and we believe the statute would
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
benefit from a broader reorganization at
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
this time um these amendments will
 
04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
restructure RSA 361a so that it aligns
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
with the other state laws that we
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
administer um that govern the licensing
 
04:10:34.109 --> 04:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
of consumer credit entities um that's
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
the first one number two the banking
 
04:10:37.710 --> 04:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
department has observed a moderate
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of consumer
 
04:10:41.229 --> 04:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
complaints relating to car dealerships
 
04:10:43.630 --> 04:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um including those that
 
04:10:45.790 --> 04:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
are engaged in the business of uh retail
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
Sellers and sales finance companies
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
there was a um pretty big enforcement
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
action brought by the New Hampshire
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office in that
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
concluded in December
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
2022 um and this bill is designed to
 
04:10:59.950 --> 04:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
strengthen um some protections for
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
consumers who enter into retail
 
04:11:03.389 --> 04:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
installment contracts when purchasing
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles in New Hampshire um and
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
that will be done through among other
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
things regular exams and and enhanced um
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
credential standards for retail sellers
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
so um going forward this would result in
 
04:11:17.710 --> 04:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
examinations of um retail sellers on a
 
04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
regular um exam cycle by the New
 
04:11:23.950 --> 04:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire banking Department um and um
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
and like I said before we we worked on
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
this um rewrite in collaboration with
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Auto Dealers
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
Association in doing that sounds like an
 
04:11:37.630 --> 04:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
mulier thank you very much thank you
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
Sor yes sorry um so I had in my notes
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
that um they would be submitting an
 
04:11:53.710 --> 04:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
addition to the bill for an amendment do
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
we have that
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes we submitted that um
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
before the public hearing um the first
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
one back roughly two months ago and my
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
understanding was that was with the um
 
04:12:07.590 --> 04:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
that went to the office of legislative
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
services I don't see it on the website
 
04:12:09.920 --> 04:12:11.950 align:start position:0%
services I don't see it on the website
but

04:12:11.950 --> 04:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:15.309 --> 04:12:15.319 align:start position:0%
um we did submit
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.590 --> 04:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.520 --> 04:12:42.109 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:12:42.109 --> 04:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.119 --> 04:12:56.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right so what's in this amendment
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
looks like it rewrite the whole thing no
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
I guess not section one of the bill by
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
replacing no I'd be H I can I can speak
 
04:13:09.149 --> 04:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
to that okay okay yeah it does really
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
four things and again we worked on this
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
um amendment in collaboration with with
 
04:13:15.109 --> 04:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
the Auto Dealers Association um the
 
04:13:17.149 --> 04:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
first thing it revises the effective
 
04:13:19.109 --> 04:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
date the original Bill had an effective
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
date of July 1 of this year um this will
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
push it to Jan one of
 
04:13:27.469 --> 04:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
2025 um we believe um both the
 
04:13:30.030 --> 04:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
department and business would benefit
 
04:13:32.109 --> 04:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
from that six additional months to
 
04:13:34.990 --> 04:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
prepare um for the new law um it
 
04:13:37.309 --> 04:13:37.319 align:start position:0%
modifies the definition of significant
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
event in the statute um under under the
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
um under the bill lenses must report
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
report what's called significant event
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
so if there's a significant regulatory
 
04:13:48.429 --> 04:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
action against that lcy by another state
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
for example um they would have to report
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
it to the banking department and this um
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
this revises the definition of
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
significant event in the statute and we
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
really wanted to strike the right
 
04:14:02.429 --> 04:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
balance between requiring lenses to
 
04:14:04.590 --> 04:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
report um significant events but not
 
04:14:06.429 --> 04:14:06.439 align:start position:0%
being o overly burdensome on what they
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
need to report
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it modifies the section of Bill that
 
04:14:12.790 --> 04:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
pertains to the initial license term for
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
Li lies and really this deals with the
 
04:14:16.990 --> 04:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
situation where a new license is
 
04:14:18.910 --> 04:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
approved toward the end of the year in
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
November or December um this would not
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
require a ly that's approved in that
 
04:14:27.189 --> 04:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
two-month period to renew the license
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
almost immediately at the end of the
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
year P licenses that uh we administer
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
expire at the end of the year so this
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
would give those new licenses an extra
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
up to two months and then uh at the
 
04:14:41.149 --> 04:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
beginning of when they're first uh
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the department and then
 
04:14:45.109 --> 04:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
the last thing is there are some
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
technical and clarifying changes to the
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
examination Authority Section again this
 
04:14:51.870 --> 04:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
this this section in particular we
 
04:14:53.229 --> 04:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with the Auto
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association and it was really
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
just to um provide clarifying uh
 
04:15:00.070 --> 04:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
revisions to that section so that
 
04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
there's a clear understanding of what's
 
04:15:07.149 --> 04:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
process the amendment okay OTP OTP on
 
04:15:13.469 --> 04:15:13.479 align:start position:0%

04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
four represent M you're raising your
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
hand right
 
04:15:47.149 --> 04:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
much okay uh all right now relative
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
requiring notice to Consumers of
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles that require repair solely
 
04:15:55.950 --> 04:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
through a dealership and contain
 
04:15:55.960 --> 04:15:58.229 align:start position:0%
through a dealership and contain
proprietary

04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
proprietary
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
information uh I mean if anybody doesn't
 
04:16:03.389 --> 04:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
know that the computer computer's in the
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
in the car the new
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
car is not paying attention is that a
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
buyer beware issue I don't
 
04:16:11.920 --> 04:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
buyer beware issue I don't
know

04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
spear the only place I'm having problem
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
with this with this uh with the
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation I don't expect that
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
anyone should be able to fix the
 
04:16:33.469 --> 04:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
computer itself right but I do expect
 
04:16:36.510 --> 04:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
that they should be able
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
to buy the
 
04:16:42.269 --> 04:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
computer bu the but actually no I don't
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
you know something don't want to do that
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of setup that's
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
involved when I read my users manual
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of setup involved and
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
that's not front of the amateure you
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
need a lot of equipment to do that yeah
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
this I mean yes the nature of cars today
 
04:17:00.189 --> 04:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
is that they're incredibly proprietary
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
and yes they want you to take it back to
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
the service center and my assumption is
 
04:17:08.349 --> 04:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
the reason the reason why the the
 
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh you know the how much
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
money the dealer makes on selling the
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
car is very little and over the years
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's shrunk and trunk and trunk and is
 
04:17:19.109 --> 04:17:19.119 align:start position:0%
because they the manufacturers is
 
04:17:21.070 --> 04:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
telling the dealers you'll make it up in
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
surface but there's another real reason
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
there's another real reason if those
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
cars if those computers are not set up
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
right with the right mixture of air and
 
04:17:31.349 --> 04:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
the right mixture of gasoline and
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
everything else that it does you could
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
end up in a liability situation where
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
somebody dies and so I think that
 
04:17:41.309 --> 04:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
just you know I and I've worked a lot on
 
04:17:43.950 --> 04:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
Military uh or automob Auto uh
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
Automobiles and those things are very
 
04:17:48.630 --> 04:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
tricky to set up so I I don't think that
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's just something for an amateur to
 
04:17:55.229 --> 04:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
do but this okay yes this bill want if
 
04:17:59.229 --> 04:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
you recall wanted a label just sign yeah
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
but the label could be this long of what
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
is not right um shall I fix a label to
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
the rear window of the vehicle um that
 
04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
will require any repairs that can be
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
only made at a dealership so the list
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
can be quite long and then we talked
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
about what about you know motorcycles
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
and other other vehicles so this was
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
just that label the bill the way I
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
understood it a sign it's just a sign on
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
the door no no on the on the car right
 
04:18:31.760 --> 04:18:33.790 align:start position:0%
the door no no on the on the car right
right

04:18:33.790 --> 04:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
represent I was having a hard time
 
04:18:37.550 --> 04:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing wrapping my
 
04:18:39.510 --> 04:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
head around like what constitutes a
 
04:18:42.109 --> 04:18:42.119 align:start position:0%
proprietary part right like is it a a
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
single nut somewhere that's you need a
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
special wrench for right like how how do
 
04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
you determine the thousands of parts
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
that are on a vehicle right so
 
04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
unworkable to
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
BR now we know where all the cups are
 
04:19:03.149 --> 04:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
going um yeah I mean if there is going
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
to be a notice on the car and it talks
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
about proprietary information they might
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
also want to notti note that when you
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
have these computers they get
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
proprietary information from you about
 
04:19:18.269 --> 04:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
you and about the car personal
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
information they do cuz I heard it on
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
NPR today they know more about they know
 
04:19:27.070 --> 04:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
more about you than you know about
 
04:19:29.550 --> 04:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
yourself no they said for you know it is
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
it is an issue for some people don't
 
04:19:33.229 --> 04:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
want that isn't didn't I see Progressive
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
some of these insurance companies they
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%

04:19:38.269 --> 04:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
they'll know whether you're a speeder or
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.640 --> 04:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%

1122 okay what does the amendment say
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment said is limited to
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
National flood incidences and not to any
 
04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
man-made uh requirement you know not to
 
04:22:29.229 --> 04:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
any man-made flooding like some tenants
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
do some really bad things to houses oh
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that's eliminated and it's has to
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
situation so was Hampton
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
a national flood situation is Hampton
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
flood sure yes go over get yeah I would
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
say so yeah I don't know was it no it
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen for you don't let me read
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
the exact the feds don't make a ruling
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
for like a month or two months away let
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
me let me get you the exact words the
 
04:23:03.309 --> 04:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
bill only the the bill only refers to
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
situ notification when there's a
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
transaction when there's either a sale
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
or someone is um leasing the property so
 
04:23:13.790 --> 04:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no notice requirement
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
after this weekend's flooding for
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
anybody nobody has to provide any notice
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
of that unless they are going to sell
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
their home in the future or rent it or
 
04:23:23.399 --> 04:23:24.229 align:start position:0%
their home in the future or rent it or
rent

04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
rent
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
it so it's only uh it's only going to
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
the Future and you think that's okay so
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
that means sometime when I want to
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
sell that summer home I have in
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
handed that I have to tell them if I
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
know there was a federal flood in in my
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
in in in around my house there's two
 
04:23:47.870 --> 04:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's two requirements there's you you
 
04:23:50.590 --> 04:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
need to let a prospective
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
purchaser or renter know whether the
 
04:23:56.189 --> 04:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
home is in a flood
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
zone or whether whether there was any
 
04:24:02.109 --> 04:24:02.119 align:start position:0%
flood damage that occurred from natural
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
sources and that's the and that's the
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
and that's the change we made from
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
natural sources during the time that you
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
own the property what we were trying to
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
do in representative speak here you know
 
04:24:15.149 --> 04:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
raise this issue is trying to
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
distinguish between a flood that occurs
 
04:24:20.109 --> 04:24:20.119 align:start position:0%
because the sum pump broke or somebody
 
04:24:22.630 --> 04:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
poured sand down the toilet that clogged
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
up the uh septic system that's not
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
something that we're trying to address
 
04:24:29.349 --> 04:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
we're trying to just address situations
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
that are caused by natural events such
 
04:24:35.550 --> 04:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
as flooding from Tides river river
 
04:24:38.349 --> 04:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
flooding Etc so this has actually
 
04:24:39.710 --> 04:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
happened there are some people who
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
bought a house that was naturally
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
flooded the flood the flood was reported
 
04:24:46.309 --> 04:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper and everybody knew
 
04:24:49.349 --> 04:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
there was a flood and
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
and you're requiring the person who
 
04:24:56.109 --> 04:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
sells the house to disclose it and if
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
happens what happens to that person who
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
said t i that was 10 years ago and I
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
forgot all about
 
04:25:12.429 --> 04:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
it the same thing that happens if they
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
they we would be adding this to the
 
04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
sales the purchase and sales agreement
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the same thing would happen if they
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
fail to disclose information on on a on
 
04:25:23.149 --> 04:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
a purchase and sale agreement which is
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I don't know okay well someone
 
04:25:27.070 --> 04:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
who's been around for those those all
 
04:25:29.269 --> 04:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
those statutes but it's very what we've
 
04:25:30.790 --> 04:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
done is we've added it to the purchase
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
and sale
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
agreement similarly to the requirement
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
to disclose lead arsonic and
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
radon correct and that is based on the
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
person who actually had done those
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
tests okay how would I know I this is a
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
summer home I don't know what happens to
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
my summer home when I'm not
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
there well if it got flooded you would
 
04:25:55.950 --> 04:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
no what I'm saying is the flooding is so
 
04:25:58.349 --> 04:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
minor and this bill says you got I need
 
04:26:00.670 --> 04:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
to report it because there was a federal
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
notice everybody knew about it excuse me
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
everybody seemingly knew about it except
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
the person who's buying it seems to be
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
ignorant that there're that that they're
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
they live in a place like this well you
 
04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
you I want to back up for a second you
 
04:26:16.030 --> 04:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
asked me has this actually happened and
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
the and what I what I shared with you is
 
04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
some um input I received from a
 
04:26:23.830 --> 04:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
constituent of mine who lives in an area
 
04:26:27.630 --> 04:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
that floods routinely and in his um in
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
the note he talks about there were at
 
04:26:32.670 --> 04:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
least four people in his neighborhood
 
04:26:36.670 --> 04:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
who bought homes in 16 18 1920 and 21
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
who were never informed that there was
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
any that that there that they were in a
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
flood zone or they had had any flooding
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
until they went to the to get a mortgage
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
and at that point for a lot of
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
purchasers it it's too late because when
 
04:26:55.750 --> 04:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
they find out that all of a sudden
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
they're in a flood zone and they have to
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
purchase flood insurance and now all of
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
a sudden they've got a they've got a
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
budget for an additional five $110,000
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
extra in flood insurance so that that
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
screws up the whole economics of their
 
04:27:11.429 --> 04:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
home purchase so what we're trying to do
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
these people paid cash for their
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
house then went to the bank to get a
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
mortgage and the bank said oh by the way
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
did you know you're in a flood plane if
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
they paid cash and never got a mortgage
 
04:27:25.630 --> 04:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
they'd never know about it
 
04:27:27.870 --> 04:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
exactly so what we're trying to do is
 
04:27:29.670 --> 04:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help out those people
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
who bought a house who made that
 
04:27:35.109 --> 04:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
decision because anybody who did Finance
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
because I I most the mor most of the
 
04:27:40.349 --> 04:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
sales I see it's always pending
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
financing okay okay so you're now just
 
04:27:45.070 --> 04:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
saying oo well so now we're going to put
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
a statute in there for those people who
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
don't have that due diligence that the
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
even the bank could do that they
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't do before they bought it and
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to put in this statute about
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
by the way Hampton
 
04:28:01.229 --> 04:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
floods I think it had to do with
 
04:28:05.590 --> 04:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
Realtors as well right on real rather
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
than as much as I'd like to think I'm an
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
expert on this I'm
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
not um I did actually have a there are
 
04:28:14.189 --> 04:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
are a couple people that have joined me
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
today that are much better at this uh
 
04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
than I am and have much more experience
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
with them if I could have them come up
 
04:28:22.830 --> 04:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
that would be we in the meantime
 
04:28:25.149 --> 04:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative pelli has has a comment
 
04:28:27.389 --> 04:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very sensitive to this because I
 
04:28:30.670 --> 04:28:30.680 align:start position:0%
also represent the Sea Coast okay so the
 
04:28:33.510 --> 04:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing this forward
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
right we we have obviously we have
 
04:28:38.030 --> 04:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
issues with but it's not only flooding
 
04:28:41.309 --> 04:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
it's also drainage issues so I spoke to
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
five different Realtors on the Sea Coast
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to get their
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
perspective what do they tell what do
 
04:28:49.469 --> 04:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
they know how are they informing their
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
perspective buyers and every one of them
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
without you know I didn't give them that
 
04:28:56.070 --> 04:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
much information every one of them
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
referred to me to the um property
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms that they must fill out
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
and it's very clearly stated in
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
disclosure yes the current disclosure
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
forms what's not what's on the gray area
 
04:29:13.109 --> 04:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
is drainage which which is probably if
 
04:29:16.670 --> 04:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're trying to inform o uh potential
 
04:29:19.630 --> 04:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
buyers that there may be water issues
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
flooding is not the only issue that
 
04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
would cause problems with their home and
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
water issues so I do not live in a
 
04:29:31.389 --> 04:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
federally designated you know a flood
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
zone but every house on my street has a
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
su pump because we have drainage issues
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that's also something if
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to cover the perspective
 
04:29:46.990 --> 04:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
buyer that needs to be addressed but I'm
 
04:29:49.790 --> 04:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
not sure what it is that we're trying to
 
04:29:52.750 --> 04:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
add to the or what process we're trying
 
04:29:52.760 --> 04:29:54.309 align:start position:0%
add to the or what process we're trying
to

04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:29:56.750 --> 04:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
improve I may your expert you're got
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%

the unknown designation is selected
 
04:32:53.229 --> 04:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
brief anecdote just to answer your
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
specific question about someone doing
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
their due diligence uh a single mother
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
um Cashes in her 401K looks to invest in
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
a home to uh upgrade herself and her
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
children um finds a beautiful spot after
 
04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
engaging a realtor next to a a gorgeous
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
gurgling Brook the realtor uh helps her
 
04:33:14.910 --> 04:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
through the disclosure process in which
 
04:33:19.150 --> 04:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
the seller States unknown for flood um
 
04:33:23.470 --> 04:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
the buyer for whatever reason um wanted
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
to do additional due diligence went to
 
04:33:28.990 --> 04:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
her trusted insurance agent The Trusted
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
insurance agent looked up on a website
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
um through their insurance software as
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
to whether this property was in a
 
04:33:38.910 --> 04:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
designated flood zone or not and they
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
came back with a certificate that
 
04:33:43.869 --> 04:33:43.879 align:start position:0%
specifically said it wasn't so now two
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
people have reinforced the fact that it
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
was not and it turns out that they were
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
in error specifically because they said
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
unknown and then specifically because
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
the geoc coding for this property was
 
04:33:58.470 --> 04:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
incorrect um this person again cashed in
 
04:34:01.629 --> 04:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
her 401K did her due diligence made the
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
largest investment of her life to
 
04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
upgrade her her for her children um as a
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
single mother and then the nightmare
 
04:34:11.199 --> 04:34:12.670 align:start position:0%
single mother and then the nightmare
began

04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
began
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
because uh it turns out then then she
 
04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
was in a designated flood zone when she
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
went to refinance it was found out that
 
04:34:19.400 --> 04:34:20.230 align:start position:0%
went to refinance it was found out that
she

04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
she
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
was she wasn't able to afford the pre so
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
she did get financing well when she went
 
04:34:28.390 --> 04:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
to get financing she found out pay cash
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
it was incorrect she would have had to
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
pay the uh the flood insurance which
 
04:34:32.629 --> 04:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
then she wouldn't have been able to
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
afford that payment as a result she
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
could not leverage her investment to uh
 
04:34:41.390 --> 04:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
pursue other economic opportunities um
 
04:34:41.400 --> 04:34:42.949 align:start position:0%
pursue other economic opportunities um
and

04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
had had significant trouble now when she
 
04:34:48.269 --> 04:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
tried to take action against said
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
realtor and said other agency um sorry
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
no luck it was your own fault you were
 
04:34:57.789 --> 04:34:57.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to do the due diligence um had
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
that Realtor simply looked at a map and
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
done their job and they would have
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
clearly seen clearly seen that this
 
04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
property was in a designated uh flood
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
zone uh another brief anecdote again a
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
person a working family purchased a home
 
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
the property was in a designated flood
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
zone but it had been removed via a a
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
process called a letter of map Amendment
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
before they purchased the property um
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
they engaged again the seller had
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
engaged a realtor who again said unknown
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the sale and marketing of the
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
property um it was designated as not in
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
the flood zone because of this letter of
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
map Amendment now they purchased through
 
04:35:48.189 --> 04:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
um a governmental entity this loan was
 
04:35:51.070 --> 04:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
then transferred to a servicer who then
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
hired a vendor who made an error and
 
04:35:54.670 --> 04:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
imposed flood
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
insurance the uh customer was then not
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
able to make their payments um thus
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
ruining their credit and they are now in
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
foreclosure as a result trying to fight
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
against this specific option this law
 
04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
would specific Ally protect both of
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
these people as well as the commercial
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
landlord and investor that is doing
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
their due diligence but perhaps running
 
04:36:25.949 --> 04:36:25.959 align:start position:0%
into incorrect information um maybe
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps an online vendor that is
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
providing uh uh work based on a geocoded
 
04:36:33.629 --> 04:36:33.639 align:start position:0%
address that is not pinning or being
 
04:36:37.150 --> 04:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
located in the correct area uh I as a
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
professional I literally deal with these
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
stories three to four times a week and
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
they are heartbreaking to listen to and
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
the simple remedy would be to as the
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
realtor is marketing the property as
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
they normally would to Simply remove the
 
04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
unknown and have them specifically um
 
04:37:01.629 --> 04:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
look at as to whether or not that
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
property is located in that mapped flood
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
zone or not and then if there is an
 
04:37:11.269 --> 04:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
event you know then you as the homeowner
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
would simply disclose whether you are
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
aware as it says in the text um as to
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
whether you are aware or not and that
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
you would simply answer truthfully and
 
04:37:21.551 --> 04:37:21.561 align:start position:0%
if you are not there when that event
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
happens and you weren't aware of it
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
happening you would be able to answer
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
truthfully that that you weren't aware
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
of that event firsthand and and that you
 
04:37:28.959 --> 04:37:30.269 align:start position:0%
of that event firsthand and and that you
didn't

04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
know representative M later um it's very
 
04:37:36.750 --> 04:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
easy to access these government flood
 
04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
zone uh Maps very easy but you're
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
telling me that there often wrong so the
 
04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
maps themselves are not incorrect
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
now we have to look at this from you
 
04:37:52.830 --> 04:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
know 30,000 fet okay a flood insurance
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
rate map is is printed and produced by
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
FEMA and it is adopted by the community
 
04:38:00.910 --> 04:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
and what that flood insurance rate map
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
shows is it shows approximate risks it
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
will show areas that are included in a
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
special flood Hazard area that are
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
susceptible to a 1% store form discharge
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
it will show areas that are not included
 
04:38:17.949 --> 04:38:17.959 align:start position:0%
as well so it's binary right in or out
 
04:38:19.949 --> 04:38:19.959 align:start position:0%
but you have to look at it in the sense
 
04:38:22.709 --> 04:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
that it is showing you risk and if you
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
are close in a close proximity to that
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
area you know certainly it is something
 
04:38:29.310 --> 04:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
that you might want to look into more
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
pursue hire a professional to get more
 
04:38:34.029 --> 04:38:34.039 align:start position:0%
information all of the mapping is
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
available um for free on the FEMA
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
website and you can download every
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
single flood insurance rate map in the
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
entire country country and every
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
territory for free and View and consume
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
it where the errors arise is when you're
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
doing a geocoded database search so for
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
instance uh if you've ever used a GPS um
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
and you've put an address sometimes that
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
address you've plugged into that GPS
 
04:39:01.869 --> 04:39:01.879 align:start position:0%
will get you in the exact spot you want
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
to go sometimes it will get you very
 
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
close and sometimes it will take you
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
over the hill to Grandma's nowhere near
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
where you numbering was the opposite
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
I've seen that where the the address one
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
is on the south end of the road not the
 
04:39:17.189 --> 04:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
North End of the Road and and so this
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
occurs quite frequently when you're
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
doing a geocoded search and if you are
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
looking to check the status of a
 
04:39:25.629 --> 04:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
property that's in a flood zone and you
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
have an error in that geocoded search
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
where you're at the North End of the
 
04:39:30.189 --> 04:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
Road as opposed to the South End of the
 
04:39:32.670 --> 04:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
Road that could make a significant
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
difference obviously in the biggest
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
investment you may want to make in your
 
04:39:37.199 --> 04:39:38.510 align:start position:0%
investment you may want to make in your
entire

04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
entire
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
life so when I look in here and it says
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
civil action so the only you're saying
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
this would resolve the problem it
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't resolve the problem because the
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
person still has to sue are they suing
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
the realator or are they suing the
 
04:39:55.550 --> 04:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
seller of the property so let's say um
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
let's say you're you're a buyer you're
 
04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
an investor um let's go to your story
 
04:40:00.270 --> 04:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
let's take your one woman story that's
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm I'm I'm getting I'm
 
04:40:02.830 --> 04:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to answer I'm going to answer your
 
04:40:06.030 --> 04:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
question um so you you engage a realtor
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
and you want to know all of the due
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
diligence the realtor is going to do the
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
due diligence for you so the realtor
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
engages a third party to prepare this
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
flood report for you to is this a seller
 
04:40:19.070 --> 04:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
realator or a buyer re realator uh could
 
04:40:19.080 --> 04:40:19.948 align:start position:0%
realator or a buyer re realator uh could
be

04:40:19.948 --> 04:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
either saying who who's the one that's
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
liable in this case I'm getting to that
 
04:40:27.708 --> 04:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
in this case let's say it's the sell's
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
realtor so the Sellers realtor engages a
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
third party and they provide a report
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
and that report is not correct it is not
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
accurate okay so the liability based on
 
04:40:39.708 --> 04:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written would rest
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
solely on the vendor
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
that that Realtor relied on it would not
 
04:40:47.310 --> 04:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
rest on the shoulders of the realtor
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
whereas if this language wasn't in there
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
it is very very possible that that
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
liability would rest solely on the
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
shoulders of the realtor and that's not
 
04:41:00.270 --> 04:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
what we want obviously if you are a
 
04:41:02.590 --> 04:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
professionally licensed realtor and you
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
are relying on third- party information
 
04:41:08.190 --> 04:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
and you feel that that information that
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
you've paid for comes from a credible
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
source certainly there should be
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
liability on that third party that is
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
issuing that information and
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing it and that's what this
 
04:41:19.280 --> 04:41:20.590 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing it and that's what this
language

04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:41:23.310 --> 04:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
resolves and if there's no third
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
party uh if there's no third party and
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
someone made an error then obviously
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're liable for it sure who may I ask
 
04:41:33.270 --> 04:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
question person checked off unknown that
 
04:41:35.390 --> 04:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
unknown would go away with this bill no
 
04:41:38.110 --> 04:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm saying if that if the if the
 
04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
person checked
 
04:41:41.708 --> 04:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
unknown under the current Cent form
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
there's that unknown how does that solve
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
this if that person said if they checked
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
unknown if there was no third party
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
analysis that this this the story your
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
story which is what I originally
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
visioned is because we saw a lot of
 
04:41:59.230 --> 04:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
people just paying cash and then and
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
then financing afterwards so this person
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
bought the house paid cash the realer
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
got his commission the sale occurred and
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
then when they go to finance the bank
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
said oh by the way you're in a flood
 
04:42:10.638 --> 04:42:11.910 align:start position:0%
said oh by the way you're in a flood
zone

04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
zone
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
at that point if all they have is this
 
04:42:18.430 --> 04:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
form that she's got here that says
 
04:42:20.910 --> 04:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
unknown she's dumb out of luck right in
 
04:42:23.550 --> 04:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
this specific case that buyer did go
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
back to the realtor that she engaged
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
said hey what the heck and the realtor
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
said I didn't know not my fault okay so
 
04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
then so that means this bill would not
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
have solved her problem no this bill
 
04:42:35.670 --> 04:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
would solve her problem because it would
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
have removed because the bill removes
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
the unknown checkbox so you only have a
 
04:42:46.070 --> 04:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
a yes or a no and then in that case what
 
04:42:48.550 --> 04:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
the what the realtor would have done is
 
04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
they would have had to actually do some
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
due diligence that they were hired for
 
04:42:55.708 --> 04:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
as a buyer's agent to provide that
 
04:42:57.390 --> 04:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge and information to the buyer
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes or no okay they checked off no okay
 
04:43:05.310 --> 04:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
and now is it who when I if that this
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
woman who is she going to sue is she
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
going to sue the realator or is she
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to sue the person who sold it who
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
who she has to prove lied when they said
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
no so in this in this specific case if
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the realtor prepared that information
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and looked at it then the realtor would
 
04:43:24.750 --> 04:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
be liable if the realtor relied on a
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
third party that prepared Incorrect and
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
inaccurate information it would be that
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
third party that's liable we're assuming
 
04:43:34.510 --> 04:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
that the realator be offering up this
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
Pur and sale agreement that has the
 
04:43:40.510 --> 04:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
check no they're liable if that no is
 
04:43:43.390 --> 04:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
wrong only if they didn't rely on a
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
third party only if they didn't rely
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay if they relied on third
 
04:43:49.788 --> 04:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
party they're going to go Sue that third
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
part correct and this they didn't rely
 
04:43:53.230 --> 04:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
on a third party they relied on the
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
person saying no there's no never been
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
any flooding problem okay now the
 
04:44:00.628 --> 04:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
realtor is the one that's liable for
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
offering up this document and what is so
 
04:44:07.868 --> 04:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
that this court can then get civil is is
 
04:44:11.670 --> 04:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
going you then now suing she has to
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
sue the realtor of course I mean
 
04:44:15.868 --> 04:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of property by a
 
04:44:18.430 --> 04:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
realtor is is a pretty significant issue
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
I just don't hear a lot of those cases
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
well there there are significant there
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
are significant cases where Realtors
 
04:44:26.110 --> 04:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
will misrepresent property and that and
 
04:44:30.430 --> 04:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
that is in that case that is that that
 
04:44:30.440 --> 04:44:31.110 align:start position:0%
that is in that case that is that that
the

04:44:31.110 --> 04:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
realtor um is is guilty simply because
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
that you have to then demonstrate
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
evidence not you don't have have to
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the evidence the realer knew
 
04:44:46.030 --> 04:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
you have to demonstrate the evidence
 
04:44:49.990 --> 04:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the owner the seller did know right
 
04:44:51.868 --> 04:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
you have to prove that the seller did
 
04:44:54.910 --> 04:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
know because your the ENT was the no was
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
checked so now to go to a court you have
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
to then prove that that somebody did
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
know that it had a flooding problem th
 
04:45:05.230 --> 04:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct you would have to prove
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
that somebody did know that the property
 
04:45:09.910 --> 04:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
was in a designated flood zone and
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
typically that would not even in the
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
flood zone you just had to know there
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
was flooding right wasn't this thing
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is all about flood zone well well
 
04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
so the disclosure would be about whether
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
the property is located in a mapped
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
special flood Hazard area so FEMA prints
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
flood maps for each community and those
 
04:45:30.788 --> 04:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
flood maps are publicly available and it
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
will show whether or not a structure or
 
04:45:35.670 --> 04:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
property is located in that special
 
04:45:38.590 --> 04:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
flood Hazard area it's simple to procure
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
the map to view it to look where the
 
04:45:42.910 --> 04:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
property is and if the realtor
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
designates it
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
incorrectly they would certainly be
 
04:45:48.470 --> 04:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
liable for that unless they relied on
 
04:45:50.430 --> 04:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
that third party who would then be
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
liable for that may I ask a question Mr
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairman may I ask a question yes
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
represent Gibbs thank you
 
04:46:00.270 --> 04:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
when you refer to a third party is that
 
04:46:03.798 --> 04:46:04.868 align:start position:0%
when you refer to a third party is that
third

04:46:04.868 --> 04:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
third
 
04:46:08.350 --> 04:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
party uh the company that the realtor
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
hired to do the GPS search or is that
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
third party the actual seller or could
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
it be either one it it could be either
 
04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
one um it could also be let's say the
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
seller had financed uh through a lender
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
and the lender issued an incorrect
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
determination and the seller by no fault
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
of their own disclosed that they were
 
04:46:35.110 --> 04:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
not in a a mapped flood zone and the
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
documentation that they received from
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
their Bank showed that they were not in
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
a mapped flood zone but they
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
were uh then that again the responsible
 
04:46:47.070 --> 04:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
party for that would be the preparer of
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
that third party information the bank uh
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
no it wouldn't be the bank it would be
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
whoever the preparer of that third party
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
information is whether so probably we're
 
04:46:58.590 --> 04:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
back to the seller uh no not the seller
 
04:47:00.990 --> 04:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
again well but who who are we talking
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
about so the realtor they're suing the
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
realtor no no it wouldn't it wouldn't
 
04:47:08.910 --> 04:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily be the realtor so who would
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
it be it would be disclosed on whatever
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
that report or document is so if you
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
purchase a piece of property and you get
 
04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
a professional report on your septic
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
system professional report from whom
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
well if you get something on your septic
 
04:47:26.190 --> 04:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
system you're going from whom okay wa
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
let's let's start back let's let's take
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
a step back a second this whole thing
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
about the third party person is sort of
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
a red herring because you're going to
 
04:47:38.830 --> 04:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
that is really a plausible Deni that's a
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
deniability that makes the real not
 
04:47:44.830 --> 04:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
liable at the end of the day if I
 
04:47:47.788 --> 04:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly there your
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
this intention of this bill is the
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
realtor is responsible you're taking
 
04:47:56.430 --> 04:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
away unknown you're deleting the unknown
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
which I I guess that I have to read that
 
04:48:00.990 --> 04:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
in here you're deleting the unknown and
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
now the question is yes or no okay yes
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
there was flooding or no excuse me yes
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's within the flood zone or no it's
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
not in the flood zone that's a truth
 
04:48:15.390 --> 04:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
simple black and white either it's in
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
the flood zone or not in the flood zone
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that the third party is just a you
 
04:48:23.070 --> 04:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
know the defense for the realer if the
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
realtor said no and it turns out it was
 
04:48:30.270 --> 04:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
yes but he said yes only because he got
 
04:48:33.070 --> 04:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
bad advice he got bad from a third party
 
04:48:36.270 --> 04:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
end of the day the real who's liable for
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
this yes no question followup question
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes thank you
 
04:48:44.590 --> 04:48:44.600 align:start position:0%
um going back
 
04:48:47.470 --> 04:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
to uh who who was
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
liable um suppose that
 
04:48:51.440 --> 04:48:53.150 align:start position:0%
liable um suppose that
the

04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh that the seller genuinely doesn't
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
know um and the seller is the only third
 
04:49:03.230 --> 04:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
party if the seller was the seller of
 
04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
the property the per that's right the
 
04:49:06.990 --> 04:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
person who sell sells the property
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's no other professional report so
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
the realtor relied on the seller and
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
because it's not only I took a look at
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
the at the language um in in the
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and the language is not only
 
04:49:21.548 --> 04:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
is it in a flood zone but was there
 
04:49:24.070 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
flood damage during the time that the
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
seller owned the property so suppose the
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
seller had rented out the property or
 
04:49:31.230 --> 04:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
lent it to someone or for whatever
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
reason the seller was away when the
 
04:49:33.160 --> 04:49:34.190 align:start position:0%
reason the seller was away when the
damage

04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
damage
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
occurred and the damage was minor enough
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the seller comes back and you know
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
it it's just looks like ordinary wear
 
04:49:43.868 --> 04:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
and tear or something like that so the
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
seller genuinely doesn't know but the
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
damage occurred while the seller owned
 
04:49:51.750 --> 04:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
the property in that case who is
 
04:49:54.750 --> 04:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
liable correct me if I'm wrong Chris but
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
in my reading of the bill no one would
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
be because that seller would be
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
answering truthfully as it states in the
 
04:50:04.750 --> 04:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
language that that he or she did not
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
know that there had been flood damage I
 
04:50:09.030 --> 04:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
mean if they are answering truthfully
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
then then they wouldn't be held
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
to any liability for that okay and when
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
you refer to professional reports can
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
you give us an idea of who prepares
 
04:50:20.910 --> 04:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
these professional reports sure there's
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
all kinds of um outfits out there that
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
prepare them from uh engineers and
 
04:50:27.548 --> 04:50:27.558 align:start position:0%
surveyors to uh uh appraisers and
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
Realtors um there's an entire industry
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
of of companies that prepare flood zone
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
determinations for lenders and
 
04:50:36.750 --> 04:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners and uh real estate
 
04:50:38.708 --> 04:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
professionals um I know that there are
 
04:50:40.350 --> 04:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
multiple real estate professionals
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
spefic specifically on the Sea Coast
 
04:50:44.350 --> 04:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
that when they actually do list a
 
04:50:47.070 --> 04:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
property will engage a third party to
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
have that flood report attached to their
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
listing and you'll see um a lot of times
 
04:50:54.510 --> 04:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
and this is certainly with sophisticated
 
04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
Realtors on the listing it'll say uh no
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
flood insurance required or flood
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
insurance required and on the uh
 
04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure it will show a report from a
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
third party stating whether or not it is
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
or is not in or close maybe there's a
 
04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
risk analysis uh along with that and
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are a multitude of companies that
 
04:51:15.310 --> 04:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
provide this information and suppose
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
you're an ordinary person who doesn't
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
know anything about the the existence of
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
these companies could you then be liable
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
because you should have
 
04:51:26.070 --> 04:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
known they're working with their realtor
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
the realtor should be telling them this
 
04:51:30.628 --> 04:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
correct because typically it's the
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
realtor that is going to procure that
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
third party so for instance if there's a
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
boundary issue with a property and a
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
realtor suspects that perhaps there's a
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
boundary issue because the two neighbors
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
have been arguing um the realtor will
 
04:51:48.548 --> 04:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
help to have that homeowner engage a
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
land surveyor to potentially resolve
 
04:51:54.030 --> 04:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
that situation um you know the realtor
 
04:51:56.430 --> 04:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
will help facilitate a lot of this stuff
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
does that mean the realtor then is going
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
to be liable for that boundary issue uh
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
no absolutely not certainly if there was
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
an error in doing that survey was would
 
04:52:10.350 --> 04:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
be the surveyor's um accountability in
 
04:52:13.230 --> 04:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
that that sense uh and it would apply
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
simply to a report or disclosure uh for
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
a realtor that again either refers or
 
04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
relies on a third party to to prepare
 
04:52:24.910 --> 04:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
that information and prepare that
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
you here's here's my question an
 
04:52:37.070 --> 04:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
analogous somewhat analogous situation
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
let's say that there's lead paint and a
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
child's going to move into a house how
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
is that typically handled in um who'd be
 
04:52:45.868 --> 04:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
responsible if family moved in didn't
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
know that there was lead paint there I
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
mean I know it's a I believe it's a
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
federal law that if a building is built
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
prior to 1973 you have to disclose that
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
there could be lead in in that property
 
04:52:59.310 --> 04:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
um as far as liability beyond that I'm
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not equipped to speak to that
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's a separate lead disclosure form
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
but most people when they're filling out
 
04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
the disclosure form most sellers will
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
say I'm not aware of anything like that
 
04:53:13.070 --> 04:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
and they have to sign that but you know
 
04:53:14.948 --> 04:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
they it it's sort of fudge but just a
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
quick question if I'm the seller's uh
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
realtor and the seller doesn't really
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
know anything about that but but says no
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
on this question because there is no
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
unknown and I as a realtor uh go to to
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
the heo map get a map where it clearly
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
shows that this property is not in the
 
04:53:35.558 --> 04:53:36.708 align:start position:0%
shows that this property is not in the
flood

04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
flood
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
zone to me that that's uh they've done
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
their due diligence
 
04:53:43.708 --> 04:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't be liable if uh you
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
know if a 500-year flood comes around
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
would that be correct that would
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely be correct and that's clearly
 
04:53:54.190 --> 04:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.510 --> 04:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay just I mean one of one of one of
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
the things you when you talk about lead
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
I mean right now in New Hampshire
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
statute there's only three
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
requirements um to dis that need to be
 
04:54:07.548 --> 04:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
disclosed on a purchase and sale
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
agreement one is lead one is arnik and
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
one is on and what we would be doing
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
with this bill is we'd add flooding to
 
04:54:16.070 --> 04:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
the to the same put that it puts it in
 
04:54:16.990 --> 04:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
RSA so going to go representative pcil
 
04:54:22.548 --> 04:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
and then representative spear right well
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
I think I believe me I'm very sensitive
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
to this issue but you're saying that you
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
want a very specific map you want a
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
specific FEMA map you know signed and
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
dated so I think it might yes I
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
understand that but for you know
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
attached to your purchase and sale
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
there're what you're saying is that you
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
want the feea map not a third party the
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's disappointing that the insurance
 
04:54:53.310 --> 04:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
company had incorrect information so I
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
think what what I'm struggling with here
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
is where is the specific requirement for
 
04:55:04.990 --> 04:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
what map and detailing exactly when they
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
looked at the math and maybe have that
 
04:55:09.868 --> 04:55:09.878 align:start position:0%
attached to the purchase and sale
 
04:55:13.390 --> 04:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise this is so subjective I looked
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
here and it said no somebody else looked
 
04:55:18.070 --> 04:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
here it said yes and I think that gets
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
very confusing and I don't want people
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
suing each other because that will not
 
04:55:25.230 --> 04:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
resolve the problem so if you're saying
 
04:55:28.590 --> 04:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
I want a specific government issued map
 
04:55:31.548 --> 04:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
that is online we need dated and
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
attached to the purchase and sale and
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to the realtor to do that that's
 
04:55:38.310 --> 04:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
a different story but not every home is
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
sold by a realtor so I want to make sure
 
04:55:42.000 --> 04:55:42.948 align:start position:0%
sold by a realtor so I want to make sure
that

04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're solving solving this issue in in
 
04:55:49.470 --> 04:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
the best possible way so that there are
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
no subsequent lawsuits I I I agree with
 
04:55:54.430 --> 04:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
you completely and and I believe this
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill does that um it does not
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
specifically State you you have to have
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
a specific flood map it says you have to
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
disclose it says you have to disclose
 
04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
whether you are located in or outside of
 
04:56:13.230 --> 04:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
a mapped special flood Hazard
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
area well the it's it's not necessarily
 
04:56:17.470 --> 04:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
the data of the mapping that's the
 
04:56:20.628 --> 04:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
problem certainly its geocoded location
 
04:56:24.910 --> 04:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
problem on on a on an online site
 
04:56:30.590 --> 04:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
correct because it's a geocoded error
 
04:56:32.590 --> 04:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
it's pulling from a different that's
 
04:56:35.310 --> 04:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
right it's pulling from a different
 
04:56:38.910 --> 04:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
database what exactly what what are you
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to do I mean would you make a
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
real estate investment based on
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
something you know now is is incorrect
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want wouldn't you want a a
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
licensed regulated professional to help
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
guide you through the process to make
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
sure you're getting the that's why I'm
 
04:57:00.390 --> 04:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
hiring a realtor for 6% of the selling
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
want and now I have to have another
 
04:57:04.350 --> 04:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
engineer try to figure this out it's
 
04:57:04.360 --> 04:57:05.430 align:start position:0%
engineer try to figure this out it's
very

04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:57:07.230 --> 04:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
confusing but then would you want that
 
04:57:08.670 --> 04:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
Realtor to check
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
unknown certainly would want a
 
04:57:11.000 --> 04:57:12.350 align:start position:0%
unknown certainly would want a
definitive

04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
definitive
 
04:57:14.830 --> 04:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
answer yes because then I would be able
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
to pursue it further so if they check
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
yes no or unknown it's still you're
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
subject to the data that is available
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
sure but again it's not the FEMA data
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
that is that is incorrect it is the
 
04:57:30.270 --> 04:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
geocoded data you would be using what
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
how am I suppos so I want to go a
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
different direction with this bill okay
 
04:57:37.590 --> 04:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day we have let
 
04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
alone the he say she say or who's
 
04:57:43.310 --> 04:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
responsible going on and on um the
 
04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
question and we were just discussing it
 
04:57:48.830 --> 04:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
here is that when someone signs that
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
purchase sale
 
04:57:53.548 --> 04:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
agreement they're signing it based upon
 
04:57:56.670 --> 04:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
all the information is on there the
 
04:57:58.990 --> 04:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
question would be is could we add a box
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
at the bottom where the person
 
04:58:03.910 --> 04:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
signs and
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
says that they have done the homework to
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
find out whether it's in the blood flood
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
zone or not in other words put the
 
04:58:17.070 --> 04:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the buyer to do to
 
04:58:19.510 --> 04:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
make sure they got the right study they
 
04:58:21.670 --> 04:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
got the right thing we don't instead of
 
04:58:25.110 --> 04:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
in that way we're not creating Court Li
 
04:58:27.070 --> 04:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
me anything that creates litigation is
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
messy in my mind okay that if we put it
 
04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
on the responsibility of the buyer that
 
04:58:35.868 --> 04:58:35.878 align:start position:0%
they had done the proper search they
 
04:58:37.868 --> 04:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
have got the right information if they
 
04:58:40.750 --> 04:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
got misinformation from somebody then
 
04:58:43.390 --> 04:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
they can sue that person for the
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
misinformation because that they thought
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
they got it but that rather than getting
 
04:58:50.590 --> 04:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
realer and seller and getting all that
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
confusion in there let's just put an
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
onus on the buyer that they tell us
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
whether they have done the due diligence
 
04:59:00.590 --> 04:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
on one the flood zone or
 
04:59:03.990 --> 04:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
not and okay now this is just a concept
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm putting out now obviously we're
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
not going to solve this problem today
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is not going to get solved
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
today we can C be taking this up in
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
subcommittee again next Tuesday okay but
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're just throwing out some other you
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
know other ways to do it to simplify
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
this bill because I mean first of all
 
04:59:22.070 --> 04:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
this whole thing with the tenant thing
 
04:59:23.590 --> 04:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
in my mind you got to take that out I
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
mean we're you know landlord tenant
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another nightmare that we
 
04:59:28.670 --> 04:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to get get involved
 
04:59:31.030 --> 04:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill um I think that's we want
 
04:59:32.910 --> 04:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
to keep it simple this is about a real
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
estate transaction and whether the
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for some of us is is
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
buyer beware but the other is saying is
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
that to to expect to get good
 
04:59:46.390 --> 04:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
information out of a seller or the
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
realator of the seller or the third
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
party consultant of the seller just
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
makes it like a nightmare representative
 
04:59:54.760 --> 04:59:56.350 align:start position:0%
makes it like a nightmare representative
spear

04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
spear
 
04:59:59.070 --> 04:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
I thank you I bought my house 20 years
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
ago not that long ago I received no
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
notification about radon I received I
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
certainly never received anything like
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
this I got nothing What state were you
 
05:00:10.910 --> 05:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
here just right in nation when you
 
05:00:13.350 --> 05:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
bought the property yeah oh what did I
 
05:00:15.868 --> 05:00:15.878 align:start position:0%
live I came out of New York okay New
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
York does a very different thing than
 
05:00:19.628 --> 05:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
what we do here so you never saw one of
 
05:00:21.390 --> 05:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
these never saw one of these never knew
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
anything about radon the only way I
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
found out about radon is a neighbor came
 
05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
to me and said did your real estate
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
agent tell you about radon and I said I
 
05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
don't even know what that is and then I
 
05:00:33.868 --> 05:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
found out and we had the radon thing in
 
05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
so you've never seen this agreement
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
before never have seen it before okay so
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
now I can understand by or beware I
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand that notion but I resent the
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
fact that they not responsible to tell
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
us anything and I I I don't feel good
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
about that at
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
all I'm I'm an engineer so I knew that
 
05:00:55.470 --> 05:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
there were things that I had to get take
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
care of and I knew I had certain
 
05:00:59.070 --> 05:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but not everybody does
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
know that and I think it behooves us to
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
make these real estate agents take some
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
level of responsibility for giving us
 
05:01:07.948 --> 05:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
some level of information cuz I never
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
saw anything like this before well
 
05:01:12.590 --> 05:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
obviously you you had a private sale
 
05:01:14.110 --> 05:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
what did you sign a purchase sale
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
agreement you know you know what the
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
purchase sale agreement is versus the
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
deed no okay represent as a real estate
 
05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
agent this bill is much simpler than
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
people are making it out to be that's
 
05:01:32.750 --> 05:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
number one number two uh it's the seller
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
who initiates the disclosure now the
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
buyer has to accept that but all the
 
05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
seller has to do in my mind
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
in in conjunction with their selling
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
broker is find out whether the place is
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
in a flood zone now think if the buyer
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
wants to go out and hire a third party
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine but but if I'm
 
05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
the the seller's agent I'm going to tell
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
the seller we're going to look at the uh
 
05:02:02.110 --> 05:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
the FEMA flood map and there it says is
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
that you're not in a flood zone you
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
you've done it all if it says you are in
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
a flood zone you're going to have to
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
disclose it simple as that it's not that
 
05:02:13.030 --> 05:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
complicated it really
 
05:02:16.150 --> 05:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
isn't and and I think that selllers need
 
05:02:18.910 --> 05:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
to be pushed more into being a little
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
bit more honest I read too many of these
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
disclosures they I don't know I don't
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
know if we've ever had any problem there
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
they're just and they get away with it
 
05:02:29.310 --> 05:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
so this this representa gives
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislators speak first thank you uh the
 
05:02:36.430 --> 05:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill says more than that it doesn't say
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
just is it in a flood zone which might
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
be at least relatively easy to find out
 
05:02:44.230 --> 05:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
it also says has there been any flood
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
damage and that's where I think you run
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
into the problems that I mentioned
 
05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
before the am took some of that out the
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
amendment took some of that out the
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have in front of
 
05:02:58.868 --> 05:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
us it it didn't look like that but I
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
could be wrong if if the amendment took
 
05:03:02.628 --> 05:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
some of that out that would be better
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay yes
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
sir yeah you have to turn the mic on
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
there we go it's on um so I think this
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
goes beyond just the sale the
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
transaction too um we'll say right when
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
the what this bill would do also would
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
bring people to the town because town
 
05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
has additional regulations for flood
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
plane management so this would be an
 
05:03:25.070 --> 05:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have that dialogue with
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
said seller or buyer say what you can
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
and cannot do with your property after
 
05:03:31.470 --> 05:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
you buy it so that's more information
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's more opportunity to get out of
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
that information uh the buyer because
 
05:03:37.548 --> 05:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
what educate them about all the zoning
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the community especially
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the flood
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
because right not not all the not all
 
05:03:45.390 --> 05:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
the ores but specifically related to we
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
would tell them about that obviously but
 
05:03:49.470 --> 05:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
the flood plane um I can tell New Market
 
05:03:51.628 --> 05:03:51.638 align:start position:0%
there's only specific areas in town
 
05:03:54.070 --> 05:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
where you can build in a flood plane um
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
and other areas it's prohibited you
 
05:03:59.788 --> 05:03:59.798 align:start position:0%
can't expand so again we're giving more
 
05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
information to people who are making a
 
05:04:01.520 --> 05:04:02.788 align:start position:0%
information to people who are making a
huge

05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
huge
 
05:04:05.788 --> 05:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
investment so then that's opportunity to
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
have that dialogue so this bill would do
 
05:04:08.718 --> 05:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
have that dialogue so this bill would do
this

05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
I don't see that but
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay this build has put is is is gives
 
05:04:19.070 --> 05:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
people a false sense of repr you just
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
made it what you kept saying is this
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
person made a mistake this people
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
screwed up these people had the wrong
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
address this happen this happened okay
 
05:04:29.470 --> 05:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
all does if you did that then everyone
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
who buys this think that that they're
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
all set they're think they're all
 
05:04:34.230 --> 05:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
protected they don't have a flood
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
problem because that person checked off
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the box and they were wrong what's wrong
 
05:04:42.350 --> 05:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
with that no you're I mean you know
 
05:04:46.070 --> 05:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative U melier he he summarized
 
05:04:48.430 --> 05:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
it best I mean it's not that complicated
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is having a
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
seller share information about their
 
05:04:56.830 --> 05:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
property withy not be correct and that's
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
the seller's responsibility to make sure
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's correct whole problem you didn't
 
05:05:02.830 --> 05:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
solve anything you just told us all the
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
time that these people had the wrong
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
address or the wrong GPS location that
 
05:05:09.150 --> 05:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
the company and oh well it's okay they
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
could just that other company who's in a
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
better situation to resolve that issue
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
situation the seller or the buyer the
 
05:05:18.910 --> 05:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
seller who knows the property and where
 
05:05:21.948 --> 05:05:21.958 align:start position:0%
the property is located or the buyer who
 
05:05:24.150 --> 05:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that information I'm saying
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
the buyer has an obligation to do
 
05:05:28.110 --> 05:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
diligence and I'm not disagreeing with
 
05:05:30.030 --> 05:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
you but I have I'm also saying that the
 
05:05:32.548 --> 05:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
seller has an obligation to share all
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
the information they have about the
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
property to the buyer before they they
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
they complete that transaction we we
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
went through this when we you noticed of
 
05:05:44.390 --> 05:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
that list what was anybody ever died or
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
anybody had AIDS in that house I mean we
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
went through the same whole debate and
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
you go back and read those paragraphs
 
05:05:53.310 --> 05:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
and see what we did okay at the end of
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
the day we all know that you're not
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to go and tell the full story
 
05:05:59.750 --> 05:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to tell everybody you
 
05:06:01.590 --> 05:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
know the dirty little details of what
 
05:06:03.628 --> 05:06:03.638 align:start position:0%
happened in that house you're trying to
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
sell it you know but you don't want to
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
sell a problem no no see but you've got
 
05:06:11.230 --> 05:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why selling it so why don't
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
you just say I'm just going to Discount
 
05:06:16.150 --> 05:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
this price $100,000 because I know full
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
well that you're going to flood out
 
05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I have a
 
05:06:23.110 --> 05:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm going to oppose this
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the chair so in the scenario with
 
05:06:28.910 --> 05:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
this single woman who was given false
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
information and it blew up her whole
 
05:06:32.830 --> 05:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
investment do you think that she was
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
solely responsible for that when she got
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
false information that nobody should be
 
05:06:41.110 --> 05:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
liable here that she screwed up
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
did did she get the false the false
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
information should she be holding the
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
bag cuz somebody else screwed up I think
 
05:06:51.510 --> 05:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
that if that if you're buying a house in
 
05:06:54.830 --> 05:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampton and if you don't know to check
 
05:06:56.868 --> 05:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
whether that property is in a flood
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
plane or that what is the history of
 
05:07:01.150 --> 05:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
that property then I do think you're
 
05:07:03.990 --> 05:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
being irresponsible okay but I I follow
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
up follow up I have I having a scenario
 
05:07:10.030 --> 05:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
I have friends who bought a property
 
05:07:13.230 --> 05:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
along a river and they were stupid okay
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't they didn't I mean I'm being
 
05:07:16.548 --> 05:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
totally honest they were stupid they did
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
not find out that the freaking house was
 
05:07:22.548 --> 05:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
going to float away at some point s
 
05:07:24.830 --> 05:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
River and so the fact that they were
 
05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
dumb should they be hold up the whole
 
05:07:29.150 --> 05:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
bag or did the realtor have some and the
 
05:07:31.788 --> 05:07:31.798 align:start position:0%
seller have some responsibility to tell
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
these dumb
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
people killing me and and and there's a
 
05:07:38.830 --> 05:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
lot of other places tell somebody
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're dumb
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
they're not listening they're they're
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
away for this the winter I'd like to
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
call call the question excuse me there's
 
05:07:50.510 --> 05:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
one one comment that I I have to make I
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
came from out of state to move here I
 
05:07:55.628 --> 05:07:55.638 align:start position:0%
didn't even know there was such a thing
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
is right on I never would have looked
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
for it if you're coming from I don't
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
know New Mexico you might not think
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
about flooding you you just don't know
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't consider myself on the dumb
 
05:08:13.390 --> 05:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
list but maybe I am I didn't know if I
 
05:08:16.270 --> 05:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
bought a house anywhere along the coast
 
05:08:18.150 --> 05:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay any town along the coast it's not
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
just on the coast flooding I look at the
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
if you're buying a house along the coast
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
you have to consider flooding not fire
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
you're smarter than the aage repres if
 
05:08:31.270 --> 05:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the FEMA map it's not just
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
the coast I don't disagree that anybody
 
05:08:35.590 --> 05:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's buying a home in in Hampton
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
should ask the question because you're
 
05:08:39.470 --> 05:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
close to the marsh but what about the
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
person that buys a home in Claremont or
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
New Market I mean they're they're far
 
05:08:47.948 --> 05:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
away from the ocean they get affected by
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
right on the Connecticut River and the
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
house could float down the river Mr
 
05:08:53.230 --> 05:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
chairman would you believe 71% of the
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
planet is covered in
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
water okay what we're going to do is
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to take this up on Tuesday
 
05:09:01.830 --> 05:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
we'll reschedule this bill for Tuesday
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
and and that gives everybody the whole
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
weekend to think about how do we how do
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
we do this bill right but I can tell you
 
05:09:09.868 --> 05:09:09.878 align:start position:0%
right out of the block
 
05:09:12.510 --> 05:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
the landlord tenant thing is not uh
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
you're if you insist on trying to keep
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
that in this bill then that I there's no
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
way in the world I can find a compromise
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
for you that that just opens more caner
 
05:09:23.470 --> 05:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
worms that's a whole different set of
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
you know issues and and I'm sorry we
 
05:09:28.110 --> 05:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
can't you know you the purchase sale
 
05:09:30.190 --> 05:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
agreement has nothing to do with
 
05:09:32.190 --> 05:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant it's a totally different
 
05:09:34.590 --> 05:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
agreement and and we've excluded we
 
05:09:37.510 --> 05:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've B we've we've separated that
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
I mean the amendment the original Bill
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
the the bill that was originally filed I
 
05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
thought I saw it in the amendment the
 
05:09:45.390 --> 05:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that was filed originally was
 
05:09:48.430 --> 05:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
drafted incorrectly it lumped the
 
05:09:51.670 --> 05:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
renters and and purchasers together in
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
the the first amendment I shared with
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
you and this amendment that you have now
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
we've separated that and all that we are
 
05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
asking is that a flood disclosure be
 
05:10:04.750 --> 05:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
included in the lease agreement okay so
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
am I looking at the correct Amendment
 
05:10:10.750 --> 05:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
1122 1122 why do I see things in here
 
05:10:13.470 --> 05:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
that says tenant because we're still we
 
05:10:16.230 --> 05:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
still think that disclosing the same
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
information about flood risk to a tenant
 
05:10:20.830 --> 05:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
is appropriate if I'm just saying I
 
05:10:22.628 --> 05:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
can't I would not I can't that's a
 
05:10:25.470 --> 05:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
non-starter for me I and I I respect
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
that but I I would also say that it it
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
it it's important because there have
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
been situations where tenants have
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
entered into a lease they've gone to bed
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
and it's rained overnight and they've
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
woken up and the parking lot's flooded
 
05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
and their car is underwater y or the
 
05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
house is has molden okay all right so
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
just a question for you and and by the
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
way thank you everybody for your your
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
time and attention to this I I I really

check a box if you don't like the you
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
know the different three different
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
questions okay which is already in
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
statute right if you want to come back
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
with it at the at the end of the sign
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
where the person signs and they checked
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
off a box that they they have done due
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
diligence to find out whether there's
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
flooding and whether they they've
 
05:11:45.750 --> 05:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
checked the federal flood zone and that
 
05:11:48.430 --> 05:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
they're confident that they got a good
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
report okay if you come in with anything
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
you know but you know and if you come in
 
05:11:55.230 --> 05:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
with tenant I mean I no I I I'm I'm just
 
05:11:56.708 --> 05:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
trying to keep it simple get to the
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
point that you want to make and whose
 
05:12:01.470 --> 05:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility at the end of the day no
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
one should be buying a property that's
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:12:08.948 --> 05:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
flood nobody should be buying that and
 
05:12:11.310 --> 05:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
if they are buying it I sure hope they
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
got a good discount to build up put to
 
05:12:16.830 --> 05:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
lift the house up and put it on stilts
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
which is what I get to see in my summer
 
05:12:20.990 --> 05:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
community that every house that sells
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
down in mamic at Rhode Island is now
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
built with stilts
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
right what's
 
05:12:30.510 --> 05:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
up just to to really quickly address
 
05:12:33.070 --> 05:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
that um technically everyone is in a
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
flood zone it just has to do with your
 
05:12:36.670 --> 05:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
risk and if you were to drive down
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
through alad in 2005 you would see
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
houses on the side of a mountain that
 
05:12:43.788 --> 05:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
were literally washed away by flooding
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
that weren't in designated that's not a
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
good example because that was a man-made
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
cause that was a cber that got clogged
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and no no it wasn't it was it was a
 
05:12:54.910 --> 05:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
natural it was it was aad it was a super
 
05:12:56.750 --> 05:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
discharge there was a a higher than
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
normal amount of rain discharge and it
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
created flooding like people had never
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
seen and there were literally houses a
 
05:13:06.230 --> 05:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
different allstead flood than I know of
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
the one I know of where someone died was
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
because of a cver there were two floods
 
05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
was one in 2005 and one in 2007 both of
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
them occurred in
 
05:13:18.510 --> 05:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
allad right buildings that were affected
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
were literally on the sides of mountains
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
and you know all right all set could I
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
just say one last thing yes um to to
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
representative portelli's point I mean
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
about drainage I I I I get it I mean
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's a that that is an issue um and I
 
05:13:36.750 --> 05:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's an issue we want to
 
05:13:38.628 --> 05:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
try to address in this specific bill I
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
think that's another issue um so I just
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to dismiss it as not
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
important I just think it's um it's a
 
05:13:48.750 --> 05:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
diff it's a little bit different than
 
05:13:50.670 --> 05:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
than flood risk but you might want to
 
05:13:52.230 --> 05:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
think about that at some point that
 
05:13:55.788 --> 05:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
might to your point why don't we we got
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
to go when representative hunt de
 
05:14:00.150 --> 05:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
support bill will add that I'm supposed
 
05:14:01.948 --> 05:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
to go down to finance and Salvage
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana so we got to keep going here
 
05:14:09.310 --> 05:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
oh let's keep it here okay all right 149
 
05:14:11.548 --> 05:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
establishing a short-term rental
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%

05:14:44.670 --> 05:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
just don't want us to try to solve it um
 
05:14:46.670 --> 05:14:46.680 align:start position:0%

05:16:09.430 --> 05:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
establishments what what's what was the
 
05:16:11.310 --> 05:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
story with this
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
bill don't we have a a public works
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
effort that a building Cod didn't we
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
already pass a bill on this subject
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
matter we we delayed one because of uh
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
the building codes right we and so they
 
05:16:26.430 --> 05:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
established some building codes so why
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
are we dealing with this
 
05:16:30.990 --> 05:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
again I remember that that is correct I
 
05:16:34.350 --> 05:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
think this is an itl itl i okay I
 
05:16:36.990 --> 05:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was interim study says same
 
05:16:37.000 --> 05:16:37.830 align:start position:0%
thought it was interim study says same
as

05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
1173 yeah this bill is similar to a
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill a bill that we already
 
05:16:44.590 --> 05:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
passed that was the bill we passed last
 
05:16:47.070 --> 05:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
so it should be on to the Senate that's
 
05:16:49.030 --> 05:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
right you don't yeah so okay so we can
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
just itl this one y
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
okay unless we want an interim study in
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
case the Senate kills that one oh no it
 
05:17:01.110 --> 05:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
so Mike do you know anything about that
 
05:17:03.030 --> 05:17:03.040 align:start position:0%

05:17:46.590 --> 05:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
Chris okay so this is another issue
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:56.910 --> 05:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
I I spoke to the
 
05:17:59.788 --> 05:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
department and uh begged them to fix
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
this problem so that we can not have to
 
05:18:06.910 --> 05:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
deal with this bill but so um hopefully
 
05:18:09.470 --> 05:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
this solves the issue I'm not sure the
 
05:18:15.548 --> 05:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:15.558 --> 05:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
right okay perfect all right so you'll
 
05:18:24.270 --> 05:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
look on two sides she's bold faed what
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
you need to know because this turns out
 
05:18:30.030 --> 05:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
to be a 14 page
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
rules not five
 
05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
page okay so the D you can see now that
 
05:18:38.830 --> 05:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
what how we have the definition who's a
 
05:18:40.030 --> 05:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
bed and
 
05:18:42.788 --> 05:18:42.798 align:start position:0%
breakfast and then uh over on you can
 
05:18:45.548 --> 05:18:45.558 align:start position:0%
lick your finger I don't care and then
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
BB is what a snack is is now allowed so
 
05:18:51.750 --> 05:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
we took out if you remember me before
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we had the discuss the the rule was
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to be um you know no more than six
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
snack six times a a month and and uh uh
 
05:19:03.230 --> 05:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
but now we're we're getting focused in
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
on exactly what is it uh that there
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
is is allowed to be
 
05:19:10.200 --> 05:19:12.070 align:start position:0%
is is allowed to be
made

05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
made
 
05:19:15.430 --> 05:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
so wasn't there a discussion
 
05:19:18.510 --> 05:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
about I'm sorry who who I'm sorry I have
 
05:19:22.110 --> 05:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
some notes that say that we would that
 
05:19:24.750 --> 05:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
where meals are to take out snacks and
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
the definitions of of of what is
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate would be left to rules
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
correct so do you want to come in and
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
explain to her how this works so because
 
05:19:44.350 --> 05:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:47.868 --> 05:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
uh I think the key the key word that I
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
noticed when I looked at this was U
 
05:19:55.708 --> 05:19:55.718 align:start position:0%
reheating commercially made food so that
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.230 --> 05:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
stofers that would be okay sure hi I'm
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
Abby Rogers I'm the legislative leis on
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
for the division of Public Health
 
05:20:08.350 --> 05:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
Services um I just wanted to share that
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
the Department was made aware of
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
Representative Lehman's concern on
 
05:20:14.230 --> 05:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
Outreach to the department before I
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
guess it was last session on this issue
 
05:20:18.510 --> 05:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
and so we preemptively had our rules
 
05:20:20.470 --> 05:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
open so when you see that L that very
 
05:20:23.350 --> 05:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
long rule this is only a portion of that
 
05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
so what we changed in the role to
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate um on behalf of his
 
05:20:29.750 --> 05:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
constituent who is a a owner of a bed
 
05:20:31.830 --> 05:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
and breakfast was to expand the
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
definition of bed and breakfast uh to um
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
allow the service of a snack for late
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
arriving guests who may come late to the
 
05:20:39.868 --> 05:20:39.878 align:start position:0%
bed and breakfast and they missed the
 
05:20:42.070 --> 05:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
breakfast piece um also adding a
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
definition of snack in the rule so
 
05:20:45.708 --> 05:20:45.718 align:start position:0%
that's clear so that's what we did in
 
05:20:48.910 --> 05:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
the rules and the rules uh passed uh
 
05:20:51.628 --> 05:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
Jael car on February
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
16th okay so you want to answer my
 
05:20:57.390 --> 05:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
question reheating commercially made
 
05:20:59.590 --> 05:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
food right so does that mean I can
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
reheat a stoer meal because they took it
 
05:21:03.788 --> 05:21:03.798 align:start position:0%
out of the freezer and microwaved it can
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
that be pered yes that means that it's
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
not prepared at the bread and bed and
 
05:21:10.510 --> 05:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
breakfast in definition of something
 
05:21:12.628 --> 05:21:12.638 align:start position:0%
that just needs to be reheated and not
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
prepared there or cooked in the bed and
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
breakfast facility that's my
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
understanding okay so it no oh yeah the
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill yeah the itl yes yeah right
 
05:21:28.590 --> 05:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh would that affect um PL and
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah um Mr chair and thank you
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
for being here today sure um would this
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
apply it says bed and breakfast would
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
that apply to an BNB type
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
or no okay no so under 143 A9 that's our
 
05:21:46.230 --> 05:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
rule making for bed and breakfast
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
there's a specific license for licensure
 
05:21:48.160 --> 05:21:48.948 align:start position:0%
there's a specific license for licensure
for

05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you sure okay represent Cole
 
05:21:55.868 --> 05:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
was there a discussion between a home
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen versus a commercial kitchen
 
05:22:02.470 --> 05:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
about this bill too so we we in the
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
conversation what we're talking about is
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
how a bed and breakfast if they wanted
 
05:22:11.548 --> 05:22:11.558 align:start position:0%
to have have meals they would then have
 
05:22:14.510 --> 05:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
to be required to put in a commercial
 
05:22:17.548 --> 05:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
kitchen so if they're not if in this
 
05:22:20.350 --> 05:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
case this particular person that you
 
05:22:23.910 --> 05:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
know they he was going on how how great
 
05:22:26.910 --> 05:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
her kitchen is but it didn't it it
 
05:22:30.910 --> 05:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
failed in septic and in sinks I think
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes right didn't have enough sinks and
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right septic and so
 
05:22:37.390 --> 05:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
therefore you know that that did they
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
would have to spend
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
20 grand to upgrade their septic system
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
and upgrade to to be able to be a
 
05:22:46.830 --> 05:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant or have a restaurant quality
 
05:22:48.548 --> 05:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
commercial quality kitchen if they if
 
05:22:50.470 --> 05:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
the definitions have been squared away
 
05:22:52.708 --> 05:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
in rules yes we don't really need this
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
anymore that is correct okay okay
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
so representative spear second by
 
05:23:00.030 --> 05:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves in expedient
 
05:23:00.040 --> 05:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves in expedient
to

05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.708 --> 05:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
legislate any discussion on the
 
05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
motion see none all those in favor raise
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:17.150 --> 05:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
5 who's
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
on I know so I'm not why not because
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
colear and oh I see why was I thinking
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
that you were voting before okay all
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
right one two three four five
 
05:23:39.310 --> 05:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
six okay
 
05:23:41.868 --> 05:23:41.878 align:start position:0%
great so in the mshot we only had one
 
05:23:43.350 --> 05:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.360 --> 05:24:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
unresolvable

05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:37.320 --> 05:25:07.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:07.320 --> 05:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.040 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
for
