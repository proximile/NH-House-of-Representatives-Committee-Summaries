here today thanks everyone um this is
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
our fourth meeting I believe and uh I
 
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
just want to take time to say I
 
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone uh having made the
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
effort and uh contributed to the
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this will probably be our
 
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
last uh official subcommittee meeting
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
there may be some offline work regarding
 
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.470 align:start position:0%
there may be some offline work regarding
a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
report uh to present to the larger
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
election law committee but in terms of a
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
formal working session uh this will
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
probably be it I
 
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
think yes sir uh Mr chairman I think we
 
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
have to have a uh formal meeting to
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
approve the report ah okay so then I
 
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
think that's a one of the niceties that
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
they want okay then then we
 
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.550 align:start position:0%
they want okay then then we
will

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
um we will have
 
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
a let's so let's take a moment and
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
our we had a lot of extra time there are
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
there are several options that present
 
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
themselves I
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 align:start position:0%
we were able in the
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
Fuller election law committee able to
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
make our way through a number of bills
 
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
last week at a faster Pace than it
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
expected I think that's possible for a
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills would the sub would
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
people be available for after the
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
election law committee meeting for a
 
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
meeting to discuss the subcommittee
 
00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.909 align:start position:0%
meeting to discuss the subcommittee
report

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
does it make sense to go before so that
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
the bills could be discussed with a full
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
committee based on a report that's
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
not right that doesn't give us much time
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
to do the report do we need to do the
 
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.189 align:start position:0%
to do the report do we need to do the
report

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
before because I'm I'm thinking we might
 
00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
could do like a verbal one and then
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
do I I just don't know that we have to
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
have the written one to the full
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
committee right by Tuesday or whatever I
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what the rules are so
 
00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 align:start position:0%
logistic logistically just thinking this
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
through a little bit the the the thing
 
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
that we would need to do is that any
 
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments to
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
the bills before us would need to be
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
ready by Tuesday for the executive
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
committee with regard to the report
 
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.350 align:start position:0%
committee with regard to the report
itself

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that we could issue it
 
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.629 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that we could issue it
afterwards

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
we this subcommittee being familiar with
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
all the discussions could make the
 
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.749 align:start position:0%
all the discussions could make the
necessary

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
amendments to bills as we see fit and
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
then uh have that we could
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps give a verbal report I
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
like that idea
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
of I just don't know that
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
we'll I don't I don't know that we'll
 
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
have time to complete a report and
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
um but to answer your question oh I'm
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
sorry no that's okay I and I know like
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
on the side I was just going to
 
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
recommend that you know we could we're
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
not meeting till 10 a.m. on Tuesday if
 
00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:34.879 align:start position:0%
we met at 9: like today on Tuesday if we
 
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
had to have anything finalized before we
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
go into our session perhaps that might
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
be something we can
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
entertain if you think that's enough
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
time to at least kind of have some type
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
report I was just going to say um that
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
yes to answer your first question I am
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
available after Tuesday although after
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
what do we got 20 bills 21 I I can't
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
remember the number that's on the list
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we we might
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
be but I like uh representative
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
Burnham's idea
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
maybe at nine I can do that too but I
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
live five miles away so I don't want to
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
speak for anybody who's going to drive
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
more than 10
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
minutes would noticing be an issue at
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
all I I don't know the rules on that we
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
could notice for 9:00 on Tuesday we
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
could meet for an hour and then we could
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
recess and then continue the meeting
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
afterwards as
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
necessary that day I
 
00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:45.509 align:start position:0%
necessary that day I
suppose

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
um again I I really appreciate
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's efforts to help bring this
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
across the finish line that that's a
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
long day on Tuesday but that may prepare
 
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519 align:start position:0%
us for Thursday so
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh so that should be that yes
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative C I'm just looking at the
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
calendar and U Thursday
 
00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:14.550 align:start position:0%
calendar and U Thursday
March

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry Thursday April 3rd is the
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
last day to report all remaining HBS and
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure whether this list for next
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
Tuesday is the final list or whether we
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
have one more executive session
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
are those are those second committee
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
bills uh some of them are FN so they
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be and the no but I meant that
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
date is that for second committee bills
 
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
or is that for but that's for all bills
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
the last day to act
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
on um House Bill oh I'm
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
sorry Thursday March 27th is the last
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
day to act on house bills not in a
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
second committee that's in that's
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
crossover date right so so crossover is
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
April 10th but they have to be acted on
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
by the Full House right
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
so theoretically so what that was the
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
27th yes so theoretically we
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
could it's possible we could do
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.110 align:start position:0%
 
before

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.069 align:start position:0%
 
18th

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
18th
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
actually this one probably is our last
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
the 18 is probably our last one because
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
the other would only be 3 days before um
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
the deadline which is not enough time to
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
notice right my understanding is that's
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
everything because um uh the chair asked
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
me to give him a list of what I thought
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
we had left and I probably asked
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham too and then I
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
think um our assistant Robin Bach also
 
00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
gave him a list so I think that's how he
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
put that together trying to capture
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
everything that we had left now we have
 
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
already exec a couple of the bills were
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee list
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
yep no that's okay all right well I
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
think so I I
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's up to us to try and adopt
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh any amendments we can do that
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
individually uh we don't have to do that
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh based on what we've
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
learned from here but I
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
um I did want to do a couple of things
 
00:11:58.269 --> 00:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
oh first I just want to always uh I
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
forget this sometimes so I want to read
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
the mission statement was um at the
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
direction of the chairman of the
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
election law committee this bipartisan
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is tasked with evaluating
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
consolidating and reconciling various
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
2025 house bills concerning voter
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
registration and the impacts of
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
non-resident voting accordingly the
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will review the proposed
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
legislation with attention to
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
constitutionality any necessary
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
alignment with federal election law and
 
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.710 align:start position:0%
alignment with federal election law and
legal

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
precedence the subcommittee will
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
consider historical context and
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities to clarify current
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
regulations the subcommittee will issue
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
a report to summarize its findings
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to do is uh
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%

the uh meeting of the subcommittee and
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
then I'd like to go over
 
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800 align:start position:0%

HB

00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
385 and um I do have an amendment but
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
it's not all that uh and I handed out
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
last week what I was trying to get as an
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and marked up the sheet so but
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill was to essentially
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
overturn uh HB 1569
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
and put us back where we were before
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
that bill was passed and so uh what I
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
did if you look in your purple book b
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I didn't do all of the OS was mostly
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
but they did a great job um it was to go
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
back to what's in our purple book so I
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
know it looks really long but 1569 was a
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
big Bill itself and kind of completely
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
over um um you know overhaul the bill so
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
in order to put it back the way it was
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
um that's why the Bill's so long and
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I can go through it Page
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
by page if you want but that that is the
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
goal and uh I don't think we need to
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
take a vote that the subcommittee does
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
not want you to do that right I I I
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that you would but um you
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
know I just made that lovely offer and
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so I have copies of the full
 
00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I did get them back that from
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
OSS and I can pass those around and I
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
have them ready for Tuesday and um so
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
there we um have that so um so that's
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
the that's the short version I'll go
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
but uh no no I see uh I see we have the
 
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
honor of Representative Lynn joining us
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
did did you want to speak to us today or
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
iot yeah
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
yeah oh I need
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
here oh thank you um did these are the
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
one two one two three those are that's
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
the full Amendment okay without the
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
markup all right thank you which I can
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
give you again but I'd have to go
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
upstairs to make get copies right right
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
right um okay but I gave last week last
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
week and so I I did because the chair
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
asked me to go through and um compare it
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
and see if I miss anything and so the
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
changes that are on page 17 and 18 those
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
were the changes that when I compared it
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
so okay so that's it did you know that
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
your bill is actually longer than 156
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
yes I know because putting everything
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
back in putting everything back in made
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
it longer but yeah all right uh very
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
good so um all right so
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
what uh what I'd like to do right now
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
too is just
 
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.910 align:start position:0%
too is just
um

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
discuss one bill that is mine actually
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
and just explain some concerns that have
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
been brought to my
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
attention uh last week when we
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
were uh meeting we did not have a full
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
the and so we the the subcommittee did
 
00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:05.429 align:start position:0%
the and so we the the subcommittee did
not

00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh formally meet during that time when
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
we were waiting for a full Quorum but uh
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
outside of the
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee there was some testimony
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
from Mr Clement totz and Mr
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh regarding uh House Bill
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
289 and I'll just relay a couple aspects
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
of that and then I'd like to get into
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion points paper that I've
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
distributed to the subcommittee here so
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Clement totz of the ACLU noted
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
that so House Bill excuse me House Bill
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
289 is regarding domicile qualifications
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
for voting and make some changes
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
to the uh RSA 651
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
654 colon 1 Roman numeral 1 and 1
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
a and had some statements about
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh domicile being claimed if a person is
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
a legal dependent under custody at
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
address at an address outside the state
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then also add some
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
residency rules as established by the
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
University of system of New Hampshire
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
and Mr Clement totz made note that from
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
a uh couple of perspectives that
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
the uh tax perspective is not under the
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
control of the voter
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily and there was some concerns
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
about the confidential confidentiality
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
of tax returns how would this be
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
enforced um H how there there's no
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
payments being made to New Hampshire
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
therefore New Hampshire does New
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have a right to those tax
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
returns and those sorts of
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
things uh and
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
taxes uh perhaps not always uh proof of
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
physical presence but um and even the
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
tax law allows for temporary absences
 
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.310 align:start position:0%
tax law allows for temporary absences
due

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
due
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
student um requirements
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
so there is there are those aspects that
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
he communicated so he he thought the the
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
aspect of a legal legal dependent under
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
custody at an address outside the state
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had issues with it both from
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
sort of a uh privacy aspect a
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement aspect and just uh
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional aspect because it's not
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
under the control of the voter whether
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
or not um a person were were to claim
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
that and then Mr O'Brien made note that
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
the university system of new Hampshire
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
establishes residency based
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
on or establishes residency at the time
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
of application is that did um actually I
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
you just Mr O'Brien just walked in so
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'll um if you wish to come up and uh
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
specify that again as a formal testimony
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
Mr O'Brien that would be
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
great sure thank you Mr chair uh I'm
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
going have to find the actually you real
 
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
quick but my name is michaeel Brian uh
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
with strategies representing my client
 
00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
America votes um and on the UNH website
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
um as it talks about in state tuition um
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
the first sentence is residency is
 
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
determined at the time of admission for
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
degree students um and
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
so again uh tying in situation to voting
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I could you know be in I could rent
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
an apartment right in New Market uh for
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
four years but if you tie qualification
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh to instate tuition uh I wouldn't
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
qualify if I didn't necessarily you know
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
if I um because at the time of admission
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that there's that's actually a
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
problem right if I live and rent a place
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
for four years maybe that turns into six
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
years who knows but I'm I am eligible to
 
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
vote right like that is very clear um
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
and then their admission standards this
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
goes back to the same conversation that
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Clement totz uh had brought up which
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
is to say um the sentence that it
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
continues to read uh to qualify for
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
instate tuition status a student and or
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
his or or her parents if a dependent
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
must physically reside in New Hampshire
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
and so this again is tying someone it
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
ties your right to vote to someone
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
else's ability to claim you as a
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
dependent um and that is problematic for
 
00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:51.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons again as was State m
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
cloi i my right to vote is mine I can't
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
control if my necessarily if my parents
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
claim me as a dependent if they don't um
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's a decision for them not
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
a decision for me but um that is not how
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
we determine voting laws for good reason
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
right obviously you get very messy if
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
someone else could determine where you
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
were able to vote um and probably a lot
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
of us wouldn't like that very much uh
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
and so uh that is you know it's right
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
off their website where I pulled this
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
from um but the the rules for being in
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
state tuition in un are far stricter um
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
for for uh for them than it is what our
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
rules to register to vote are or would
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much are there any
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Lane I don't
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
really have a question per se but I
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
recall that we had somebody here from
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
UNH their lobbyists and I think she
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
testified in much of the same vein that
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
you did do you were you here when she
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
was here and I can't even remember what
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
I can barely remember yesterday at this
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
point uh so uh I don't I'm not sure what
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
I will say is I and I said this to uh
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
the chair uh last week um you know I
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
have I think I said committee this is my
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
I think 12th or 13th year in front of
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
the election law committee uh in in this
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the house um through through my
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
work and I have seen a version of this
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh Bill uh a number of times uh and
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
there was actually one in the Senate
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
earlier this year too and I don't want
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
to be very clear that I do not represent
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
the the university system I have no no
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
ties to them and so but I do know from
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
hearing this you know one of obviously
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
the concerns is um that if uh a student
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
received inate tuition solely because
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
they registered to vote and not based on
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
the rules it would cost the university
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
system I mean it would it would bankrupt
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
the university system it feels like I'm
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
not going to again I'm not speaking for
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
them and I want to be very clear um but
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be a huge cost um to
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
the state so um that's a a separate
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
issue but it is tied and I I'm sure that
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
20 no thank you thank you and uh anyone
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
interested in that can look for the
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
testimony for the Senate bill to to find
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
out the pertinent facts of that that was
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
uh it was Comm testified and the amount
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
was discussed it was quite High um so
 
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.190 align:start position:0%
was discussed it was quite High um so
okay

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
um seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
very much Mr BR thank you and I'll be
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
here for all right
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
great all right at this point um I'd
 
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.549 align:start position:0%
great all right at this point um I'd
like

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
to uh go over a a a
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
a paper it's a four-page paper for those
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
who are looking in here that that I've
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
labeled discussion
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
points and it's it's my attempt at
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
really trying to consolidate all the
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
information that we've heard as well as
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
a number of the court cases that have
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
been identified by our researcher Mr
 
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.549 align:start position:0%
been identified by our researcher Mr
Allen

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
Allen
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
and trying to uh put all this together
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
as best I
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
could uh for the subcommittee's review
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
so let me just give a broad introduction
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
then I apologize we don't have any any
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
other copies available um suppose we
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
could get some more made if people are
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
um so what I sort of identified
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
from the court cases the the research
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's been done the testimonies that
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
and the first one is is proof of
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh I'll just introduce them
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
at a high level first and then go into
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
detail on all of them the second one is
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
the standards for
 
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
identification the third one is
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
non-resident voting or vote non-resident
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
voting and then the fourth one is really
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot applications and and
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
just to
 
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
to uh I might refine those titles a
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
little bit later um for the final report
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
but uh basically what I've done is I've
 
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
but uh basically what I've done is I've
outlined

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
a series of of aspects of each
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
issue uh identifying it as a problem
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
statement what are the adverse impacts
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
what is the proposed solution what are
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
changes and then what are the RS essays
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
that need to be changed and then what's
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
the supporting legislation or legal
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
cases and there might be some other
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
information on the form as well
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
depending upon the
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
topic for proof of
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh the current RSA requires
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
documented proof of citizenship for
 
00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:20.909 align:start position:0%
documented proof of citizenship for
registration

00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
and to some extent that is New
 
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
and to some extent that is New
Hampshire's

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
absolute right as a sovereign uh State
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
here is that we can require that only US
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
citizens or and this is this is law only
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
US citizens can vote in federal
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
elections there's a court case about
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
that very
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
specifically and New Hampshire has a
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
right to restrict voting in state and
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
local elections to US
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
citizens however per the national voter
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
Rights Act from 1993 in the rules of the
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
election assistance committee only and
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm quoting here the applicant signature
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
attesting under penalty of perjury that
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
the applicant is a United States citizen
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
is required for federal elections
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
so they don't have four Federal
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
elections in order to comply with the
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
national voter Rights
 
00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:18.919 align:start position:0%
Act an applicant does not necessarily
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
need at that
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
citizenship um
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
so that makes that the only
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
qualification where an applicant May
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
self attest to a
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
qualification but for the purposes of
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
federal election so that that self
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
attestation has to be accepted by New
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for federal elections per the
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
national voter Rights
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
Act um so so what's the adverse impact
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire must allow signature
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
attestation for federal
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
elections um the defend of proof of
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
citizenship does not have to be provided
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
on Election
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
Day and so for federal elections some
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
voters will not have provided full
 
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
qualification

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
qualification
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
um so how how do we how do we deal with
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
that my so this is what I'm
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
proposing is that we sort of establish
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
fully qualified voters and provisionally
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
qualified voters Prov fully qualified
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
voters will have provided all documented
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
or will have provided documented proof
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
for all the qualified voter
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
criteria a provisionally qualified
 
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
voter will not have provided all the
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
documented proof required to be fully
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
and applicants must provide document
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
identification for
 
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.230 align:start position:0%
identification for
registration

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh and if they don't have
 
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.070 align:start position:0%
uh and if they don't have
that

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
um at least for federal elections I
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
think we have to minimally provide a
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
provisional ballot of some sort for that
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
election and if app applicants do not
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient documented proof of
 
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.789 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient documented proof of
their

00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
qualifications

00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards they would be removed from
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:47.710 align:start position:0%
 
checklist

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
so provisionally qualified voters May
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
attest for the voter qualification of
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
citizenship for a federal
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
election and and I would propose that
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
voters to self- attest citizenship in
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
federal elections are permitted to vote
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
by federal only
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
ballot that is a practice in a a number
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
of states
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn did you want to
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
make a comment to the subcommittee
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
please you're welcome to do so we we
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
would welcome your Sage
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
advice I'm not sure how Sage it is but I
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is I I think and
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
I certainly stand to be
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
corrected I think that we're not subject
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
to the National vote we're ex we're we
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
are we are not covered by that as I
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
understand it because I mean one of
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
the that's C candidly that's one of the
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the foundations of uh 1569 that we
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
passed last year if we you know I'm I'm
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
well aware that states that are subject
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
to the National voter registration act
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
for citizenship that there's that case
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
a Supreme Court case it says if you sign
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's good enough to just sign
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
the affidavit
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
but as I understand it we are not we we
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
are one of I'm not sure how many states
 
00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
I I knew at one point but I've forgotten
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
there are a few States including New
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are not subject to that
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
are exempt from and so I think that it's
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's based on that based on the fact
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
that we are not subject to the National
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
voter registration act we are not
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
subject to that
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of you know that the only
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
way you could that it's sufficient to
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
prove C US citizenship to just sign the
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit it um if if I if I may ask a
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
couple of questions of you are you are
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
are you uh willing to take a few
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
questions or at least raise some
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
comments here sure I no I me I I didn't
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't expect to be doing this but I'm
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
happy to I'm happy to try sure I I I
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate the ad hoc participation so
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh very very much
 
00:33:07.629 --> 00:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
appreciated um so certainly the uh
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
National voter Rights Act from 1993 has
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
certain requirements um the the
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
most the the requirement that most
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
people are familiar with is what they
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
call the Motor Voter aspects where you
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
are automatically registered to to vote
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
vote with your application for a
 
00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:32.629 align:start position:0%
vote with your application for a
driver's

00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
license to my
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that part as as you
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
correctly said does not apply to New
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we had conditions
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
already in place and we have uh
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
registration on Election Day and
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
therefore um those conditions allow us
 
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.430 align:start position:0%
therefore um those conditions allow us
to

00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
exclude ourselves
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
from the Motor Voter aspects of the
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
national voter rights
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
act however I and again I I stand to be
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
corrected if I if um if you want to do
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
some research over the weekend uh is
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
that it's it's my understanding that
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
because there are uh Federal elections
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
aspects in the National voter rights act
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
require it's this aspect of citizenship
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
you don't require documented proof you
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
can just sign off and that that aspect
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
might still apply that's that's what
 
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.190 align:start position:0%
might still apply that's that's what
my

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
and that you know maybe I've divided the
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
question here but inappropriately but I
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
think that's my understanding
 
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.150 align:start position:0%
think that's my understanding
from

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh looking at is that aspect would still
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
apply to us I could be wrong about that
 
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
so you know I I guess what I would you
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
know I I as I said if I if I had you
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
know if I had known we were gonna have
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
this discussion I would have but my I
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
thought that the excl usion that there
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
was a section of the national voter
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
registration act that
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
said this act doesn't apply
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
to you know or or these states or
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
something like that this act doesn't
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
apply to these states I as I recall and
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
again I wish I hadn't I don't think that
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
it said like that it
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
said you know sections one and two and
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
three or something of this act don't
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
apply I thought it just said this act
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
okay so I I understood that to
 
00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:08.150 align:start position:0%
okay so I I understood that to
mean

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you know this that the national
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
voter registration act simply didn't it
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
didn't apply to um to the the states
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
that were exempt um but I again I wish
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
um you know I wish that I had um I wish
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
I had something in here in front of me
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
um to to and I guess you know and I I
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
have to say I if I mean I have if the
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
national voter if if the part of the
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
national voter registration act that
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
says you can um you can satisfy
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship by signing an affidavit if
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
that applies to New Hampshire then then
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I have to say 1569 is unconstitu
 
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
U I don't think if if because it says
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
you have to provide documentation and
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
and at least as to Federal elections I
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
think I'd have to concede that it was
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but I I don't think
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
that that's the case and I guess I would
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
I would have
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
if if that was the
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
case during the debate because you know
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
1569 was hotly contested I would have
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
thought thought that during the debate
 
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.670 align:start position:0%
thought thought that during the debate
on

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
1569 somebody Mr Mr Clem Clement wit
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
from the ACLU or somebody that opposed
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
it would have said wait a minute this I
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
and I know they made various arguments
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
that the law would be unconstitutional I
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
understand that and I understand there's
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
a LW but I don't ever recall them saying
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
wait a minute you can't do this because
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
the the we're not exempt from the
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
national voter registration act as to
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
this provision if they had said that
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
that would have been I mean that that
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
case the case over I cuz I would you
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
know concede that that's that if if if
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
the requirement that you can you know um
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
you can satisfy citizenship by an
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
affidavit applies to New Hampshire under
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
the national voter registration act then
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
at least for federal elections we don't
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
have any choice we have to comply with
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
that I I as I say I don't think that
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's right and I think that if the
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
opponents of 1569 had such a slam duck
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
Dunk argument for why they why it was
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional they would have made it
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't recall ever hearing that
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
argument so I think that that may not be
 
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.910 align:start position:0%
argument so I think that that may not be
the

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
case uh than thank you very much yes I'm
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
sorry uh representative
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
my question sure um having been one of
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
those opponents uh we did raise a
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
concern about the this this act and
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
we're afraid that it would in fact take
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
away that 1569 would take away the
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
granting of the exception that we have
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
from the national voter reg Rights Act
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
and that because of that uh we would
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
then fall into the requirements of
 
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
national of the act and we were
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
concerned because the state worked so
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
hard to get the exemption um that then
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
we would be in the Motor Voter act and
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
we would be falling into this and we ask
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
for an opinion but we're never given it
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
but but I'm sorry respectfully
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative that's a different
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
argument that that is a different
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
argument I and I don't disagree with you
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
you did make that you did make that
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
point but that's that's not an argument
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
that the act the national voter
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
registration act applies to us right now
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
as to this provision and and therefore
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
you can't do this that's like saying
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
well some other provision um you're
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
you're basically if I understood the
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
argument and I think I did it was you
 
00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.510 align:start position:0%
argument and I think I did it was you
are

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
making um you are
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
making it so honorous to register on
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
Election Day to have election day
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
registration that in fact in in effect
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
there's no longer any same day
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
registration because you've made it too
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
honorous and therefore if if a court
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
were to conclude that they might say
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
well that means that you don't have you
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
know longer effectively have same day
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
registration and therefore the
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
conditions of your exemption don't apply
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
that I you know is that an argument yeah
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's an argument maybe you'll win it I I
 
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
have my my suspicions about whe that
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
that may not Prevail but I could be
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
wrong but that's a different argument
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
than the one I'm talking about I know
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
but we did raise this act I all I was
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
trying to say is we did raise concerns
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
about this act and had asked for or some
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
guidance um and it we never got it from
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
um from either uh from the AG's office
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
or from um the sponsors sure sure no I I
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
hear you all I'm saying is you know if
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
if if the if the issue that has been
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
raised by the by the chair here was um
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
if that were the case I would have
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
thought that you uh you know or or
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else would have said when this
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
this is crazy why are you even going
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
forward this the the we're we are
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
subject to this provision of the
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
national voter registration act and
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
therefore you can't do this and that and
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
and and if they had if that argument had
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
been made to me I would have said you're
 
00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely right you we you know we
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
can't do this but I I I don't think that
 
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.950 align:start position:0%
can't do this but I I I don't think that
that's

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
correct representative C thank you for
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you had mentioned
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh possibly unconstitutional was that
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
actually in violation of the
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution or uh just not in
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federal uh Voting
 
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.390 align:start position:0%
compliance with the federal uh Voting
Rights

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
Act no well I mean it it's there there
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
sort of a in other words what I was what
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
I was trying saying a moment ago is
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
if the section of the national voter
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
registration act that allows a person to
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
satisfy the CI the US citizenship
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
requirement simply by signing an
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
affidavit if that section applies to New
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then under the supremacy
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
clause of the US Constitution we could
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
not not comply with that at least for
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
federal elections we could not not
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
comply with that and if we passed a law
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
that didn't comply with it it would
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
violate the supremacy clause of the
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution and therefore would be
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
representative new thank you um even
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
assuming we New Hampshire is fully
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
exempt would it be allowable for us to
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
basically recreate that Federal only
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
registration affidavit requirement
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
within our
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
laws other words I I think yeah I think
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
we probably in other words I I suppose
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could say even though we
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
are not subject to the National voter
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
registration act at all um we are going
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
to um at least for Fe we're going to
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
draw a distinction between federal and
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
state elections and say that for at
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
least for federal elections or I suppose
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
you could say you know in terms of if
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
we're not subject to the law to the
 
00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
federal law I suppose we could say
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
either for only Federal elections or
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
really even for all elections you could
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
say even though we don't have to do this
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
this is what we're going to this is what
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to do you know for the
 
00:44:04.349 --> 00:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
reasons that we had the debate on 1569 I
 
00:44:04.359 --> 00:44:05.549 align:start position:0%
reasons that we had the debate on 1569 I
would

00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
say you know I would oppose that I would
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
say that was a bad idea but you but
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
could you do that yes the only other
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is I I would really
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
strongly suggest this and I I would hope
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
this might be something there' be
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh agreement on I think it
 
00:44:26.829 --> 00:44:26.839 align:start position:0%
would be a really bad idea even if you
 
00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:28.839 align:start position:0%
could do this to draw a distinction
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
between federal and state elections you
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
know I think that's what a Arizona which
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
is subject to the National voter
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
registry that's what they did and if if
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
you know if you re if you look at what's
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
going on there there's it's it's it just
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
seems kind of crazy of having the two
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
you know the the elections are held on
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
the same day but some you you get to
 
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.829 align:start position:0%
the same day but some you you get to
vote

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
for these you know the federal Offices
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
under one criteria and State offices
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
under boy I I do not think that's a good
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
idea and I would hope that you know
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
there would be bipartisan support on on
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
not doing that I don't disagree with you
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
on that um and uh as a new
 
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative this term I'm not as
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with the whole debates on
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
1569 uh since I wasn't around for that
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
session but I appreciate the the
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
viewpoint on all that thank you very
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
well a as you uh correctly stated the
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
the law does say um I pulled it up and
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
it does
say

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh Nona there is a section in there
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
talking about non-applicability to
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
certain States
 
00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
certain States
and

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
um uh the first provision is where there
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
is no vote
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
registration requirement for any voter
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
state um and I I think there's one state
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
that falls under that category one of
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
the North Dakota perhaps I think yeah
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh then the second Clause under that is
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
a state in which under law that is in
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
effect continuously on or after August
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
1st 1994 or that was enacted on or prior
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
to August 1st 1994 and by terms has come
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
to effect upon the enactment of this act
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
so long as that law remains in effect
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
all voters in the state must register to
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
vote at the polling place at the time of
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
voting in the general election for
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
um if I if I could ask just when it says
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
under law that is in that is in effect
 
00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:59.829 align:start position:0%
under law that is in that is in effect
continually

00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
law you know what I my my recollection
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
is that what the Congress was concerned
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
about and I think a legitimate concern
 
00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:15.710 align:start position:0%
about and I think a legitimate concern
was

00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
um they didn't they didn't want they
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
were comfortable saying that whatever
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
the states were that either didn't have
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
voter registration that W North Dakota
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
whatever or the states that allowed same
 
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.790 align:start position:0%
whatever or the states that allowed same
day

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
registration if
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
that if if they had a sort of a history
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
of allowing same day registration as New
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did um uh as of I I think the
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
date that's referred to in there is the
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
date that the national voter
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
registration act would become effective
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
um that um those States they wanted to
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
exemp but I think what they wanted to
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
avoid is States deciding oh we don't
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
want to be subject to the new law so
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
we'll now change our law to allow same
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
day registration I think that's I I
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
think that was what they were trying to
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
get at is if you've already done this
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
you know for a long period of time fine
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
we'll exempt you but we're not going to
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
allow new states to decide to to exempt
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
themselves by passing new laws so so uh
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
just to clarify then the aspect that
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
that is probably talking about is really
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
the same day regist election day
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
registration I think that's you know it
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
was the way you read it it was worded it
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it was worded maybe a
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
little awkwardly but I think that's what
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
it was saying is that same day say uh
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
you can register on Election Day yeah
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
that um yes that that sounds correct so
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
um all
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
right any other
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the subcommittee not at
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
this point okay thank you thank well
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks so much appreciate it
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
again I appreciate the ad hoc uh
 
00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.109 align:start position:0%
again I appreciate the ad hoc uh
impromptu

00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
impromptu
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um Mr O'Brien I see you are
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
eager to
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
approach the microphone with some of
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
these questions as well uh Michael Brian
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
party strategies with America votes um
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
so yes we have a full exemption from the
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
NV so start there um continually does
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
reference election day registration and
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh Maine for instance
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
repealed their ele registration shortly
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
after 2010 I believe they then lost
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
their exemption from the nvra and then
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
they put it back but they still can't
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
get their exemption back so now they
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
fall under both they have same day but
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
they also fall under the NV so once you
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
remove um the ability for every voter to
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
vote on Election Day um your uh exension
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
from the NV is immediately either put at
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
risk or rescinded it has to go I mean
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's a process obviously but that's
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
part of it um to the federal having two
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
elections Point agree with
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative that it's a bad idea uh
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
we'll say we cannot do that we have one
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
checklist in this state we all of our
 
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
our laws govern all of Elections we do
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
not have like Arizona the ability to
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
bifurcate our elections and we should
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
not bifurcate our elections um but as of
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
right now as we stand we could not say
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
rules for federal and rules for state
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
like Arizona does we have one rules for
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
all of our elections minus of course
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
Town meetings which we don't classify as
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
elections right and so um uh and so
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
there um that is I just want to be very
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
clear on that that's also not an option
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
also just briefly you were pointing
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
about provisional ballots because we had
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
this debate about 418 a couple of years
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
ago uh the Constitution says that the
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
ballots have to be counted at the same
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
time uh and that's defined as like you
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
can't like you know even if you're
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
counting at 6:00 am and you started at
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
11: pm or 9:00 p.m. or whatever time you
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
can't you know go home and come back and
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
finish counting and so provisionals have
 
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
always been uh uh deemed to be something
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
we cannot do here um because of that
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
because we can't not count someone's
 
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:11.799 align:start position:0%
ballot and then turn around five days
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
later or whatever the case may be Inc
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
count them so I just want to be clear
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
with the committee on that as well and
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'll say is on 1569 and
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
the law that was passed we just had our
 
00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
first election on Tuesday uh where this
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
law was in effect um the campaign for
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
voting rights um had observed
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
in I'm going to say 10 to 15 20 spots
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
across the state um we are aware of 46
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
voters that were turned away um from
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
being able to register or be able to
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
vote um on Tuesday which is really high
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
for the number of places that we were in
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
and for the type of election this is
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
right so town meeting uh day you think
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
mostly As voters who are you know aren't
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
you're not getting a lot of new
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
registrants on town meeting day right
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't a presidential election where
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
there are lots of folks coming in um
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
including uh a woman from Hampton who
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
brought both of her kids she also had
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
her ID she had her birth certificate but
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
it did not match her uh her uh ma a name
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
and so she was unable to vote because
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
her birth cerificate did not match and
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
so uh because of that she was turned
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
away um this uh to representative Lane's
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
point I think does she was not allowed
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
to register on Election Day does this
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
put us in violation of NVR of the of our
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
exemption NV NVR right it might it
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
certainly I would hope would Len pause
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
to think about should we be I mean I
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's reasonable to
 
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
believe this woman was trying to create
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
fraud uh commit fraud showing up with
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
her two kids in all of her documents
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
except one document that linked her
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
previous name to her current name that
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be a pretty crazy thing it feels
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
like for me to do um and so we have now
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
seen this in what is generally a pretty
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
small election and it had a pretty
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
outsized impact um and so just want us
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
to be aware of that as we think about
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward and what we want to try
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we obviously have we can
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
debate Ro of fraud probably the end of
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
time with I imagine some folks in this
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
committee but what we do know is that
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
proof of fraud is pretty limited um and
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
I would I would without having to Second
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
think thing about this at all never have
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
we seen 46 cases of fraud in one
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
election certainly not in a town meeting
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
election and we just saw 46 voters
 
00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
turned away at a town meeting election
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
um and so as we weigh what is an
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
outsized impact right I just want us to
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
be aware and think about that so happy
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
to glad I was able to hopefully clear
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
some of those questions up that we had
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
um and and obviously happy to answer
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
more if I can but you you are willing to
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
take a few questions sure of course um
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um of those 46 cases
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
how many were women versus men uh I
 
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:49.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the data in front of me but
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to try and see if we have all
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
of that we just had observers there
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
right so they were watching they were um
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
to see and I don't know what their notes
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
look like to be totally Frank yeah and
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
that's only those 46 were only where you
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
had staff correct so there were many
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
other locations corre that were not
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
staffed so this n the true total number
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
could be much higher correct and I would
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
expect that it would be okay and and we
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
said this before but what we saw in
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
Kansas when they did the proof of
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship as as a requirement was
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
about 30% of Voters in the 2-year span
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
who registered and I think that's 12,000
 
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
who registered and I think that's 12,000
voters

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
were turned away from registering um it
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
is why the other thing I will say about
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
this it is not just the court said that
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
you can't require citizenship a uh um
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
federal court uh circuit court
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
because the it is it takes too too long
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
to get a passport and it is often too
 
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:45.640 align:start position:0%
expensive to get a passport so it's not
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
just cost but also time right um we know
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
it can take four to six weeks sometimes
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
longer than that to get your passport
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
and so if a voter wants to vote and
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that document it takes them
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
a long time
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
when the court looked at that and those
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
30,000 they the state's own expert who
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
went through the list to see how many of
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
those folks were citizens found that
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
over 99.9% of them work and so they
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
turned away 30,000 voters almost all of
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
whom by the state's own expert of that
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
law said yeah these were citizens and
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
they should have been allowed to vote
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so and that tracks with the reason I
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
bring that up is because that tracks
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
with the numbers that we saw on Tuesday
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
where you're not having a ton of folks
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
register right again it's a town meeting
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
day this is not same day registration is
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
not super high on this day but you would
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
see of eight people who attempted to
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
register two of them were turned away of
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
seven who attempted to register three of
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
them were turned away we pretty
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
consistently fell and that 25 to 30% of
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
people turned away which is totally in
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
line with what we saw in Kansas when
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
Kansas passed uh a similar although
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
actually less stringent law than what we
 
00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:47.039 align:start position:0%
solved with 1569 and so um I'm not
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
totally surprised by those numbers um
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
they are in line with what historically
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
we would expect based on other states
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
do you know if all of those uh
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
individuals were turned away simply for
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
the qualification of citizenship I do
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
not know again I do know that two were
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
turned away because they didn't have
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
their ID on them to vote so of the 46 I
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
know that 44 of them were turned away
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
because they lacked a registration
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
document I do not know if it was
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
strictly citizenship or if there was
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
another document they were missing again
 
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
I can try to get that for this committee
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
if we have it I am not
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
aware and I don't want to mislead
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
right so they these are individuals who
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
had not been previously reg or two of
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
those individuals were individuals who
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
had not been previously registered and
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
they had no identity papers no so those
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
two that I'm referencing sorry are
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
previously registered voters who showed
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
up and did not have their ID on them um
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
to to vote so they were on the roles
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
previously obviously I could have signed
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
the affidavit I would have had my
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
picture taken I would have gone through
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
that whole thing um and as someone who
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
has shown up once to the polls without
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
their ID on them um I sympathize with
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
that um I'm happy to it's always an
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
embarrassing story but driving back from
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
the peterb players to francistown New
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you imagine it's a lot of
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
back roads and a lot of uh a lot of
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
darkness and I took the wrong turn and
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
then made a u-turn on the on the road
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
that I was on because I needed to go
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
back and all of a sudden flashing lights
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
were behind me uh the cop I think
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
expected to find a drunk teenager but
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
found uh a you know a dad uh with his
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
wife who just returned from a show I
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
explained he he let me go I put my
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
license in my jacket pocket that I was
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
wearing because I was going to see a
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
show and so I dressed up a little bit
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
that was a Sunday on Tuesday I went to
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
go vote pulled out my wallet my ID
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't there right uh I got my picture
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
taken I went through the process I did
 
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:41.559 align:start position:0%
all of that um that's the voter we're
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
talking about they showed up they pulled
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
out their you know wallet whatever um
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
and they did not have their ID on them
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
and they were told they were not allowed
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
to vote so those are previously
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
registered folks but who who no longer
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
could sign the affidavit due to the
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
law okay
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
you're are you claiming that
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
providing identification is a burden I'm
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
not I'm I'm ask I'm just telling the
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
committee what we saw on Tuesday um and
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
asking the committee just to think about
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
as we move forward whatever
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation come from the sub
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
commmittee the full committee
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
that when you pass laws that affect
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
folks you know rights to vote
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
right that the consequence of that can
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes and this is a I think this is
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
just part of the overall discussion that
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
is had right is and I think what Mr
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
Clement to said right is what is what is
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
the cost versus the
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
benefit and so I'm not saying that you
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
know we shouldn't have laws and people
 
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:56.559 align:start position:0%
should just be able to you know do
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do but I am saying
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
to think about for instance with all
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
these absente te voter bills that we're
 
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.950 align:start position:0%
these absente te voter bills that we're
seeing

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
right if there is a voter who is
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
Homebound and we heard this from
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
disability Community right that there
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
are voters who use affidavit ballots
 
00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%
because they struggle to be able to get
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
to a clerk's office or leave their house
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
or do the things they need to do if we
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
are uh affecting their right to vote
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
what is the counterbalance to that and
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
is is that is taking the vote away from
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
a duly legitimate voter right is that
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
being made up for by whatever law that
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
again 46 voters in a town meeting
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
election or 44 to register is just I
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
mean the number I expected totally
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
honest I thought we see five maybe 10
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
for the type of election that this is 44
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
46 that we know of again has it blew me
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
away that the number was that high and I
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
just think it again it shows what is
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
the the impact appears greater than what
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
we were trying to solve because we know
 
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
the affidavits were never producing
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
those kind of numbers right occasionally
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
you would catch a person who committed
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
fraud and they were then prosecuted for
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
that act but we never saw 46 in an
 
01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
election or anywhere close to that right
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
I bet in the last 20 elections we didn't
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
see 46 and so Impact versus what you are
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
you know purporting to try to stop I
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
think it's just an important thing to
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
keep in mind as we as we move forward
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't think we yet know the
 
01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
nature of those 46 cases so we don't
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
know if they lack of proof of
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship or yeah all we know is they
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
were turned away right they showed up
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
and were told no you were not allowed to
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
vote right so I
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
think so if they were not able to
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
prove uh domicile if they were not able
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
ble to prove citizenship if they were
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
somehow not able to provide their
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
Identity or their age then those are the
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
voter qualifications cor so if if any of
 
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
those criteria were not met they would
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
have been turned away correct y so um
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay so I
 
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.069 align:start position:0%
okay so I
think

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
um while the caution is is heard and
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
well advised I think we also need to
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we understand exactly why
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
these individuals were turned away and
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
what what the situation
 
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.630 align:start position:0%
what what the situation
was

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
right Mr chair yes I just want to point
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
out that when uh
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State uh testified I can't
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
remember if it was on 1569 or 1370 I
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
kind of get them confused sometimes but
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
he said that removing qualified voter
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
affidavits for citizenship would affect
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of New Hampshire
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
voters who could not otherwise be
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
quickly verified as being previously
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
registered through the centralized voter
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
day base so yes we need to wait to see
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
I I agree on those 44 before we rely on
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
that but we also have testimony from
 
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
secet state from a year ago that he knew
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
that it would affect tens of thousands
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
of people when if they put in the
 
01:02:39.039 --> 01:02:40.789 align:start position:0%
of people when if they put in the
citizenship

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
qualification just that's all I'm
 
01:02:44.359 --> 01:02:45.990 align:start position:0%
qualification just that's all I'm
saying

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
well I just want us to remember that
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
that he said that it's it's a good point
 
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.589 align:start position:0%
that he said that it's it's a good point
um

01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
um I um and granted it was a local
 
01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799 align:start position:0%
election I'm not sure that 46 or
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is uh amounts to
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
yet but that was a general so um
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
usually um there's my my experience is
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
a 4:1 turnout ratio for or maybe 3 to
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
one sometimes
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
for um General versus a local election
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh we ended up
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's still I don't I don't know that
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're hitting that tens of thousands
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
threshold quite yet but not that that's
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
a I didn't expect that we would on town
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
meeting day I right not that that's not
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
that that sort of threshold is
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
acceptable but I think what's important
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
is that we we need to understand why
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
these people were turned away and um
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know we always have to
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
balance um we always have to
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
balance uh the necessity to
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
conduct our elections in a manner that
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
provides confidence to the voters that
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
we're conducting it with integrity and
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
that we're doing the necessary steps to
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
prevent or mitigate potential fraud and
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
I I I people often bring up the question
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
about fraud and I think the the the
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
greatest problem with fraud is that it
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
is fraud you it's U they're uh trying to
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
deceive I think
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
what's most easily prosecutable and that
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
we see the AG constantly doing is those
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who choose to vote in two
 
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.029 align:start position:0%
individuals who choose to vote in two
places

01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
places
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
are EAS are most easily caught so one of
 
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
the aspects of
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
of of this whole fraud fraud discussion
 
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.510 align:start position:0%
of of this whole fraud fraud discussion
is

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
detectability and a someone who votes in
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
two places has increased the likelihood
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the detectability of Fraud and I
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
think that's that's the nature
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
of uh some of the aspects of why why we
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
don't see perhaps larger aspects of
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
discovered all right so
 
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.069 align:start position:0%
discovered all right so
[Music]

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
um m m yes I understand that we you're
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
never going to have a system that is
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
100% just because it's human and we're
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
all human and if somebody really really
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
wants to commit fraud they will find a
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
so I think we just need to be careful
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't take a sledgehammer and
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise tens of thousands of
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
people because we think maybe 10 15 44
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
people are going to sneak through and
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
and do it because it is the right to
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
vote and there is a balancing act and we
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
just need to be thoughtful about how far
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
are we going to go to exclude people in
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
order to maybe prevent those other 44
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
people from voting I don't know but I
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
just think we need to all keep that in
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
mind when we go through all of these
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
bills you know what what are we trying
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
to to do and is it really in the best
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
people well I um I
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
I I I think this the state does not have
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
a any interest in disfranchising people
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
but I do think the state has obligations
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the uh elections are
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
are held with Integrity so and and to
 
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
are held with Integrity so and and to
not

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
create anything that is overly
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
burdensome for voters but
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
um I mean that certainly cases like
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
Crawford versus Marian clearly discussed
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
um all
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
right yes representative vernham yes
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to make a
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
comment so I had the privilege to work
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday as a ballot Clerk and in the
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
short time that I was doing that uh we
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
had two uh voters that came they were
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
new new residents of the town and
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
showed their driver's license
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they weren't on the list
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
so they were told that they needed to go
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and give um additional information to
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
the supervisor of the
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
checklist uh one of the two I believe
 
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
had to go home to get that information
 
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
but in both instances they were fine
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
they were they wanted to comply to what
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
the law was they didn't you know have a
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
problem with that and then they did come
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
back and they were able to vote so I
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
think that that is working so that was
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
just I wanted to just share my actual
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
experience in my at my table for my
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
short time that I was able to be there
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
that the same two people that were
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
rejected to get their ballot did the
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
process and then came back even if it
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
was 45 minutes later they were fine to
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
to comply so thank
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
you representative C I was just
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if it'd be worth our while to
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
formulate a couple questions for the
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to get us a response
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of um the the number of people
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
who were turned away and he may have to
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
solicit that information from town
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
moderators to find out um and
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
also uh his take on um our exemption to
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
the uh federal regulations
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe some other questions as
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
well yes thank representative new um I
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to put words in your mouth
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
but your previous statement sounded like
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
you were saying that you believe that
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
fraud is in existence in the state and
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the problem is we're just not
 
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
catching it in which case wouldn't the
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
proper solution to that
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
be providing more funds to the agent 's
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
office and increasing their fraud their
 
01:10:02.189 --> 01:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
voter fraud department so that we can
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
catch those cases that might be out
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
there rather than cutting the ability to
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
vote since as representative Lane said a
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
fraudster is going to be a
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
fraudster um and then it's a matter of
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
catching them which the registration
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
process the voting process won't catch
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
the people that you're referring to it
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
would be the later investigations in the
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
AG's Department would be the way to
 
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.270 align:start position:0%
AG's Department would be the way to
solve

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
solve
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
that just a
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
thought yeah I um thank you
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
think I think both the Secretary of
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
State and the AG's
 
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.709 align:start position:0%
State and the AG's
office

01:10:53.709 --> 01:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
deal I think they deal with if I may two
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
types of problems that
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
occur that potentially challenge
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
election Integrity one is is
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
non-compliance simply someone is not
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
following the basic rules in a in a
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
proper way and you know we see this a
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
lot with
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
electioneering aspects or other um down
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
in Hudson we had uh a number of
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions raised because a private
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
entity put up
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh electronic signs that appeared to be
 
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
very similar to what the town uses and
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
and several people contacted myself and
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
another representative who also happens
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
to be a selectman I'm on the budget
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee but um for that town but um
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
contacted me and another uh
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative about these signs they
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
thought there was improper election
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
heing going on and you know after
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
investigation um
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
my fellow representative from Hudson
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
determined that no in fact it was a
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
private entity who had hired it and they
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
were doing everything properly and um we
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
communicated that to the AG's office and
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
actually got a response within a day
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
from uh the infamous Dick Tracy and uh
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
that was a pleasure getting that uh
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
email and we were able to you know at
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
least uh you know alert them that if any
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
one complained from Hudson this was the
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
situation going on and this this should
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
be a low priority because we had already
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
helped them with a a number of aspects
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
of what would have been an investigation
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
so to me
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
that is is what I would classify as a
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
non-compliance situation I think they
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
deal with that probably 90% of the time
 
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
I think the fraud is as I said before
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
the detectability aspects of it
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
are uh much more challenging in and the
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
most obvious detectability aspect is
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
when a person votes in two places
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
because then whether it's two places in
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or as we've seen in recent
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutions someone in Massachusetts
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and someone in uh New Hampshire so or
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere in Massachusetts somewhere in
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
um so I I think a lot of their focus and
 
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
um so I I think a lot of their focus and
efforts

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
is uh you know perhaps
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
in addressing those aspects and and
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's not
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
in uh increasing the detectability of
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
fraud uh you know for for lack of a
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
better State I haven't thought this
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
through so I'm just kind of speaking
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
offand but I think that
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
is uh something to be considered I
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
um in the industries I work in um I do a
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
lot of data and Integrity Audits and
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
I've actually had the pleasure or
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
displeasure of discovering fraud and
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
having to then document that and uh
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
having those companies having to take
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
actions against people who were
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
committing fraudulent actions um for
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
monetary gain and so um it the and the
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
problem in those cases is is the
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
detectability literally
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
takes money mons or years to discover
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes and
 
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.750 align:start position:0%
sometimes and
that's

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
um a certain number of events have
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
to accumulate before you can detect a a
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
sequence of data points that show
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
something is off we've got an anomaly
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
here then you have to investigate the
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
anomaly and then you have to go further
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
into uncovering what you know Chron you
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
have to do the forensics to determine
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
what was done and and then it and only
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
then you have you begin to tie is there
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
a motive or an incentive for this person
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
to have done it to then prove the fraud
 
01:15:12.669 --> 01:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
it is a very long and cumbersome process
 
01:15:15.149 --> 01:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
I I know this at least from a data
 
01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
Integrity standpoint having been
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
involved in several of those
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
myself um having said that um I would
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
imagine that
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
the AG's office and the Secretary of
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.470 align:start position:0%
right
[Music]

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
um if it's okay so I think I I've got
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
I've received good feedback on on this
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
consider uh uh for these standards for
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.709 align:start position:0%
 
two

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
um yes before we move on I just want to
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
say that one of the um potential
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
Solutions um even if we're not or we are
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
whatever if we're going to do the nvy
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
was it NV National voter Rights Act
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
if is that and I think I think it was
 
01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
actually Mr I don't know if it was Mr
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
Clemen I can't remember who Pro who
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
first proposed this but the government
 
01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
holds the uh CI the birth certificates
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
and evidence
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
of and we are the government secretary
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
of state has the ability to
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
allow the clerks I think think to get so
 
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
at least for probably all the males over
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
18 who were born in New Hampshire we
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
could just give it to them or make it
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
available to them or I don't know just
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
pull it up and see if it's there and
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
solve that problem so nobody has to run
 
01:17:16.990 --> 01:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
around and get it and you know
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
thankfully those people had it at their
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
home but you know I I know I have mine
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure my husband has his at
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
so I just wonder is there a way that we
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
as a government and somebody said
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday in one of the speeches we are
 
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
yesterday in one of the speeches we are
the

01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
government so could we not make it a
 
01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
little bit easier for people to get this
 
01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
um and and get acquisition to it and if
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
those Federal databases ever become
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
available then you know we'll be able to
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
get to those too but is there some way
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
we could consider that we could help
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
people get these um and particularly
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
with maybe neighboring states or others
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
in the solutions and I don't know if
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's too radical to embrace it this
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
time but it just seems an easy
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
solution and then at least reduces the
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
number of people that have to worry
 
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
number of people that have to worry
about

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
C and following up on that it would seem
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
to me that it would also be possible for
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
the secretary to uh at least for the
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
women who were born in the state and
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
married in the state to be able to track
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
marriage uh that's an excellent idea as
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
well um both of those are excellent
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
if we if the state has the wherewithal
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
to make some of this process easier for
 
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
voters to prove their citizenship then
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
we should Endeavor to do that um it you
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
that you know people who have moved from
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
out of state who may not have that
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
information there
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the I forget what where I read it
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
actually um I think there was some court
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
order it may have been Arizona versus
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
the intertribal council or it may have
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
been one of the other cases um but there
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
was a series of databases that
 
01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
secretaries of States could could um
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of not Eric sorry um
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
but um that would allow them access
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh birth certificates and things like
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
or at least uh documentation or uh proof
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
of citizenship so I think there are some
 
01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
of citizenship so I think there are some
other

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
aspects um that might be helpful so
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newsome you had a comment
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um this is of course just pure
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
speculation but with the current
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
administration's attempts to get rid of
 
01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:20.229 align:start position:0%
administration's attempts to get rid of
Birthright

01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
Birthright
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh potentially in 18 years
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
birth certificates won't even the
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
evidence of citizenship so we may have a
 
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:33.639 align:start position:0%
whole another round of issues um just
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
again that's pure speculation and down
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
the road and well beyond the scope of
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
this committee today but just wanted to
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
point that out as
 
01:20:40.719 --> 01:20:42.669 align:start position:0%
point that out as
a

01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
thought yes there are there are many
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
many countries that do not have
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
Birthright citizenship so um that is
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh although I never like kicking the can
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
down the road I I am glad that I won't
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
have to worry about that aspect I I hope
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
I hope to be very much uh
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
retired um by that if Lord willing I'm
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
still alive
 
01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah would you like to speak I'm
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay please go ahead
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
represent we and members of the
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horan I'm here
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
on behalf of secure democracy and
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
something that representative Lane just
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
triggered something in my head um so
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
secure democracy in West Virginia
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
instituted a law that allowed their DMV
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
to share their uh Records with the
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office something
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
that already exists in New Hampshire on
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
a limited basis I have language that
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
would let me back up the DMV when you
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
get your real ID scans your documents
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
and keeps them
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
63% uptake on real ID Which is higher
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
than the national average so they have
 
01:22:07.629 --> 01:22:07.639 align:start position:0%
people's birth certificates you know
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
Social Security numbers whatever they've
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
done to approve their prove their
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship they have that and they know
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
if it's that document versus a green
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
card I have language that as soon as I
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
get back to my computer I can send to
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
the committee that would allow the
 
01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
secretary of State's office and the DMV
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
to share that information and the
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office could add a
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
column to the voter check list yes
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
they've proved citizenship or leave it
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
blank if not it would be very simple
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
they're already sharing that information
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to director morasco over at
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
the DMV he said it is not a problem to
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
add that information shared to the
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office so if that
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
is something this committee is willing
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
to explore I'd be happy to share that
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
language with you and then it expands it
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the onethird of people who were
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
born in New Hampshire and it would apply
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
to anyone who has a secret who has a
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
real ID we've also made the language an
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
opt in so that way if because we have
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
the right as uh individuals to delete
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
information if you want to delete your
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
photo so that way only the people who
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to share their information that
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
way would would be able to would be able
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
right um I think the subcommittee would
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
very much welcome your suggestions um
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
and if you would uh Endeavor to send
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
that to us I can do it in the next five
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
minutes that would be awesome I I think
 
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh so um if you would send it to the
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'll send it to the five of you y that
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
would be great um we would very much and
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
if you could also copy chairman Barry
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
and he already has a copy of the
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
language okay all right great
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you um thank you very
 
01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:56.430 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you um thank you very
much

01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
all right um yeah I think clearly when
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
someone is eligible to be a vo or if we
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
can do if the state can do whatever is
 
01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.270 align:start position:0%
can do if the state can do whatever is
possible

01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
to assist them in demonstrating that
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
then I think that's a good thing so we
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
want to we want to help out our voters
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
our legitimate voters uh as much as
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
possible all right uh
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
any I have asked this before any further
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
comments on the proof of citizenship
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
right all right the second one is the uh
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.310 align:start position:0%
 
identification

01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
um clear uh there are right now there
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
are some uh allowances for other photo
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
identifications that are not issued by a
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
government agency either by a state or
 
01:24:59.239 --> 01:25:00.669 align:start position:0%
government agency either by a state or
federal

01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
agency um and
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
so there are some questions that have
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
been raised in some of the bills that
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
we've are evaluating as to whether or
 
01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.350 align:start position:0%
we've are evaluating as to whether or
not

01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
and without going into the details
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
behind why there's some concerns that
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
um just say that a a New Hampshire
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
issued ID would indicate both the
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
domicile qualification being met and as
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
well as the identity
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
aspects and the age of course um if you
 
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
show up with a New Hampshire driver's
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
license and a passport or a birth
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
certificate you you there would be no
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh and so I think
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
just uh there is there are some merits
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
to having uh government issued
 
01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.669 align:start position:0%
to having uh government issued
identification

01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
identification
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
forms and I think one uh possibility is
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of that sort of
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
concept and to adapt our rsas to uh to
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
do that we have at least uh one bill
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
maybe two I I forget that address this
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that would be a good idea
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
the the the question is um I I I think
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
that should be something that is
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
done both at the time of registration
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
and at the time of obtaining a
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
ballot uh there are
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
some uh just in looking at other states
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
some states where
 
01:26:59.070 --> 01:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
if a person forgets their identification
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have an affidavit but if if
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
two or more people know them they are
 
01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.430 align:start position:0%
two or more people know them they are
able

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
able
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
to uh sign an affidavit as witnesses
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
that they know this person and their
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
that identity established by their
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
attestation by their Oaths actually um
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
so that's one alternative method that is
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
used when someone does not have a
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
identification for the purposes of
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
obtaining a
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
ballot we use
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
believe

01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
and I I'd like to hear from the
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about any concerns or other
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
considerations that
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to using a government
 
01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.629 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to using a government
issued

01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
ID representative new um on your um very
 
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
thorough four-page handout for the
 
01:28:10.189 --> 01:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
discussion points you list that the the
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
quote problem statement is that the
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
current identification requirements for
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
qualification permits various forms of
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
identity of
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
identification and I challenge that that
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
is in fact a problem
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
um that the ENT the identifications that
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
we allow
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
today require the photo signature and
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
other requirements and it's just not a
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
opinion uh thank you for that comment I
 
01:28:48.199 --> 01:28:49.870 align:start position:0%
opinion uh thank you for that comment I
think

01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.189 align:start position:0%
think
um

01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah perhaps I did not state that
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
problem State this is the problem of
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
having long session days and then trying
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
to do this thing uh trying to prepare
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
this information late at night in
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
preparation for a subcommittee meeting
 
01:29:10.109 --> 01:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
the next day um so sometimes uh the
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
thought process is perhaps not fully
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
captured I think I think it's the
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
subjectivity of reasonable evidence so
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
let me try and answer some of your
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
points which I think are are valid based
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:29:26.270 --> 01:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
statement I've made but let me try to
 
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
explain that further elaborate on that I
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
think there is some Sometimes some
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
subjectivity to what is reasonable
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
evidence I think there are also some
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
some concerns
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
that other types of identification being
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
used may not have the same standards
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
that the government uses to establish
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
identification and
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
therefore um there are some concerns
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
aspect um
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.470 align:start position:0%
and and
so

01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh I I think and th those are sort of my
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
my my two points is that some entities
 
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.629 align:start position:0%
my my two points is that some entities
issuing

01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
issuing
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
identifications do not necessarily have
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
the same government standards or and not
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
are not under government control and
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
therefore not under our control and out
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
of our control
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
um uh for the purposes of identification
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the to some degree the subjectivity of
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable evidence um and and we may
 
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
need you know do we need to in fact make
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
that less subjective and more
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
objective uh perhaps
 
01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.189 align:start position:0%
objective uh perhaps
um

01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
so I think the proposal uh the what I
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
would propose is that we do require
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
governmen issued identification
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
forms uh
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
I I
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
do we do need to uh the current rsas do
 
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
allow for the photo and things I I still
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
think we have to have some aspects where
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
provide that identification information
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that the Secretary of State doesn't
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
have to go chasing it down or anything
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
like that so okay yeah representative
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
Lane um are are we talking
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
register because they're very different
 
01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:39.210 align:start position:0%
issues right right so right now to
 
01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:40.470 align:start position:0%
issues right right so right now to
[Music]

01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
to so I I think those are two activities
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
that both require
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
identity right so the I
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
think you know registration requires you
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
prove four things once you're registered
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
you only need to require you only need
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
to prove your
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
identity so I
 
01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.070 align:start position:0%
identity so I
don't

01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.470 align:start position:0%
don't
um

01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:10.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
I so I'm I'm fine with that I still
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
think in in both
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
situations um I I don't think a person
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
should ever get a ballot if they can't
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
be identified i i i and we're not we're
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody suggested that I
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
guess what we've what we've been
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about and what we've heard is
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
not to conflate the requirement for um
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
for registering for domicile for
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
approving domicile with the question of
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
ID and for example when I first moved to
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
my uh move I moved all of 10 miles
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
within conquer but I went to a different
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
Ward so I had to go in and my ID to
 
01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.109 align:start position:0%
Ward so I had to go in and my ID to
identify

01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
myself uh had my old address on it I had
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
registered with the DMV but I was too
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
cheap to pay for the
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
new uh one so they had it in their
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
records so when I went to hand my ID it
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have the same address on it so I
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
took a utility bill just in case there
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
was any issue because I'm on this
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee and so um but um but that's an
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
instance where you know I just pulled
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
out my driver's license I didn't really
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
think about it you know
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
so I think for ID purposes it's a very
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
different scenario and I think for the
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
students who have their student IDs on
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
them all the time particularly if they
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
don't have a driver's license um so I
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
mean I didn't have a driver's license
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
when I was in college because I didn't
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
car so um it it just means it part of me
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
is like look at what the purpose is if
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to prove identity to give
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
somebody a ballot who's already
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
registered it doesn't have to be
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
government issued it just has to prove
 
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
that they are who they
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
are and and and I think we had a lot of
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
that and you're you're specifying that
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
for obtaining a bellot as opposed to
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
registration exactly so same day
 
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
registration that would not be
 
01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.310 align:start position:0%
registration that would not be
acceptable

01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
though I didn't say that I was just
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
addressing one thing at a
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
time um yes yes indeed
 
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
I um so I I think I mean that is that is
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
the challenge if we can just speak
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.119 --> 01:34:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
registered

01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
registered
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
then I I think there are I think there
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
are some challenges there right um
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't think
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
we're we we're not creating the two
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
classes of citizens I mean that's
 
01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.189 align:start position:0%
classes of citizens I mean that's
the

01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
um get to you in just a moment Mr BR um
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
I yeah we're not creating a a you know
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
two classes of citizens because we're
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
ostensibly requiring definitive proof of
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
identity for
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
registration and and I think I think it
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon New Hampshire to ha
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
have that kind of
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
requirement um
 
01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
and if if in
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
fact you know someone in in your
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
situation who you know uh who
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
who or who has a situation similar to
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
what you dis discussed is that they
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a governmen issued driver's
 
01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.709 align:start position:0%
don't have a governmen issued driver's
license

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does have a non-driver
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
identification card that is
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
obtainable U much as we suggested for
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
the birth certificates and marriage
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
certificates within the state we should
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
look into making that
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
available um
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
at at no cost at no cost or nominal very
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
nominal cost um
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
to to be a you know to be able to
 
01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.270 align:start position:0%
to to be a you know to be able to
definitively

01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
definitively
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
do that but I think again I I would
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
require that for
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
registration and and it it may be
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
possible to have uh other forms of
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
identification but I but I for
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
registration purposes I think it is
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
really keep that
 
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
really keep that
threshold

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
high for the purposes of the state
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
conducting the election with
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
Integrity without I don't think that
 
01:36:59.239 --> 01:37:00.830 align:start position:0%
Integrity without I don't think that
necessarily

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:05.030 align:start position:0%
necessarily
creates

01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
a uh a a burden there are there are many
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
places where where government IDs would
 
01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:12.430 align:start position:0%
places where where government IDs would
be

01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
required uh where in your example you
 
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
know you could not use a student
 
01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.229 align:start position:0%
know you could not use a student
ID

01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
ID
 
01:37:20.239 --> 01:37:21.790 align:start position:0%
ID
um

01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
so Mr O'Brien did you have a comment for
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
us that's very quick sorry no no that I
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
we welcome your input this is not a uh
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
we are we don't claim to be the bearers
 
01:37:36.189 --> 01:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
of all knowledge um uh so we're we're we
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
are certainly welcome to have input from
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much Mr
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
chair for again for the record Michael
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
O'Brien with party strategies here on
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
behalf of America votes um couple things
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
just want to as we think about ID
 
01:37:48.669 --> 01:37:48.679 align:start position:0%
specifically to represent Lance point
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
also under the law right now right so if
 
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
I produce a non-government ID I also
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
have to produce
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
a government document because I have to
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
produce my birth certificate or my
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
passport so and my passport would
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
obviously cover also identification but
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
my point is there is like it's not like
 
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're producing something that
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
the government has has given to you in
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
order to register to vote um I would
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
argue that for instance uh UNH is
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
covered under a government ID because it
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
is a state institution and therefore uh
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
is produced by something the state
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
governs so if we're saying the UNH ID is
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay but the Dartmouth ID is not okay
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
I don't really know how that works or
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
why that would be acceptable I also like
 
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
darkmouth is a really big employer here
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're a big part of this state as is
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
bae as is right we have like a lot of
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
these employers I guess my question to
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
back up I would just say that you are
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
always producing something now to
 
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
register to vote that is a government
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
know I mean obviously a mod if I showed
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
up with my 5-year-old's picture of me
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
and I said here's that he drew and I
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
said here's my ID I think the moderator
 
01:39:02.109 --> 01:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
would say I don't think so uh right also
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
my my K like love him a five not not
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
this is I don't think it's his career
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
path so but you know I I guess all I'm
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
trying to say here is there is
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
a um you do have to show some government
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
documents in order to register to vote
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
already and also uh that we should trust
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
our moderators I I think they are being
 
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
judicious in what they accept that they
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
understand that you know the the ID must
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
be reasonable in order to prove and that
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
we are showing other government
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
documents to register um beyond the ID
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
and yet 46 people were turned away so
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have an ID but
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's but that's a different or because
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a one of the proofs one
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the one of the for proofs which is
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
different than again showing up with
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
again I show up with an ID from you know
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
I used to work in the state house right
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
if I have my state house ID I don't
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
think I ever had St house was TR I did
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
for a minute right I showed up to that
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
would that not have counted even though
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's like I'm a state house employee and
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
would like there's it just feels like we
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
and and I would challenge the community
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
to think about and to ask and I and I am
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
fairly certain the answer to this is no
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
has there been a case anywhere where
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
someone showed a an especially New
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire an ID from bae or from and
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
they weren't who they said they were
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
that they had somehow doctored the
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
picture to change so it matched their
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
face but provided a name of someone who
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
who was on the checklist like what are
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
we at the end of the day what are we
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
getting at here who do we think we are
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
what problem do we think we are solving
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
do we think that people are showing up
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
with non-governmental IDs and saying I'm
 
01:40:37.149 --> 01:40:37.159 align:start position:0%
such and such that they and they are
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
pretending to be a different voter who's
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
on the checklist are they registering as
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
a different voter what is the ultimately
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
what is the problem we're trying to
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
solve who is this person that we're
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
trying to stop from doing
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
something I just it feels very all of it
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
feels like the any ID from a large
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
business from a school from a whatever
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
the case uh is is enough evidence that
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
you are it's got your picture it's got
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
your name that is the evidence we are
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
looking for and then you either have to
 
01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
produce other documents that match right
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
with your name and these other things or
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
you already have done that through the
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
registration process right I I do I
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate those comments I do think the
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
standards that the DMV exercises are
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
um and the the identification that they
 
01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
um and the the identification that they
provide

01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
um may be more than than
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh may may provide more information than
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
some of the company identifications or
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
company cards and stuff like that so um
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I would say B consistent incon
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
well but there yeah and and I'm again
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
that I would necessarily count uh the
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire system as a
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
government agency I'm not sure they call
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
themselves that I don't think they do on
 
01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.669 align:start position:0%
themselves that I don't think they do on
their

01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
websites um and even though there are
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
people who sit on their boards who
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
are also are uh government a agents and
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh that sort I'm again I'm not I'm not
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
quite sure about that uh if we could
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
classify University of New Hampshire
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
system as equivalent to the Department
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles or things like that so
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm not sure about that line of
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
reasoning but that is an interesting
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
much representative C wishes to speak so
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
I will yes uh in terms of the proposed
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
changes I was thinking um two things one
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
that there may be justification ation
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
for at least certain circumstances or
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
all circumstances of
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
somebody uh getting a non-driver's ID of
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
not having to pay at all um so you know
 
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's limited circumstances or
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
all circumstances for for
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
this uh voting aspect it doesn't matter
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
what so long as the person can get one
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
the other one that uh representing Lane
 
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
just happened to to talk about was the
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
change of address without having it on
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
the on your driver's license I moved
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
from Kean to conquered and then from
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
conquered to Laden and in both cases I
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
did not get the updated license but I
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
never ran into a problem with it it just
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
didn't happen to be an issue for me um
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
but you know representative Lane had it
 
01:43:54.109 --> 01:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
addressed no I I remember changing
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
addresses from Nashwood to Hudson and
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
sticky you know with the new address on
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
the back and it was like okay I I I
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
admire and deeply appreciate the prudent
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
cost-saving measures implemented by New
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for such measures
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
so I I think with that in mind um that
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
that is something we need to consider
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
of easily detected voter fraud because
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
of an address change for that reason is
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
is you know
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
um we we need to find a way we we should
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that if there are address
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
changes that have occurred that we
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
account for you know some evident you
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
know you can if if you're not
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
pre-registered let me think about this
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
if you're pre-reg I think the laws
 
01:44:59.950 --> 01:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
already account for just switching you
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
can notify someone I'm already
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
pre-registered here I I need to switch
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
possible all right any other comments on
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
the standards for
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
identification I I guess I'm still not
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
sure when you say standards for
 
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
identification is this just forgetting
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
Ballot or is this to prove residency
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
because there in my mind they're two
 
01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.950 align:start position:0%
because there in my mind they're two
different

01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
issues I I would say uh thank you again
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
for that comment I think the
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue is for registration
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay I because I
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
think it is incumbent upon New Hampshire
 
01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
to have qualified voters
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
we are able to do that I you
 
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.870 align:start position:0%
we are able to do that I you
know

01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
um yes representative c i I think that
 
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
in in U in answer to representative
 
01:46:11.550 --> 01:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
Lane's comment there I think we do need
 
01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.830 align:start position:0%
Lane's comment there I think we do need
to

01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
identify two different standards of
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
identification one for registration and
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
one just to verify that you get a ballot
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
I even if they end up being the same
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
right no but no that that that is an
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
excellent point Thank you for stating
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
that I think that that really is a good
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
point we need
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
to um I'm not
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure it's intuitively obvious we have
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
um the registration aspects we have
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
identification um requirements and I
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
think we we probably have something
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
similar but we should make sure within
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
the rsas that
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
that those two
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
activities are understood as
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
distinct and
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
sequential and
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
a very objective standard required for
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
registration I don't want to say that
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lesser one for obtaining a
 
01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.109 align:start position:0%
there's a lesser one for obtaining a
ballot

01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:47:35.119 --> 01:47:38.350 align:start position:0%
ballot
but

01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
um if they're collect if they're getting
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
a ballot in
 
01:47:42.639 --> 01:47:47.109 align:start position:0%
a ballot in
person

01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
um and they're already
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
registered we we need you know there
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
might there might be the the two
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
standards might be the same they might
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
be different we need probably need to
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
kind of think about that over the
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
weekend make amendments and and present
 
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
it uh to the committee on Tuesday but
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative plane I don't want to
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
beat a dead horse necessarily
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
but I I come back to the fact that we've
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have no evidence that this is a major
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
problem are if people are not confident
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's been a special
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
commission the governor the secr two
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
secretaries of State have said we have
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
safe and secure elections nothing's
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
perfect but to require everybody to
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
assume that everybody has easy ability
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
to get to one just to get to a DMV
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
station um office and
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
and it just seems that we are putting St
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
requiring things that we don't need to
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
because there's not been a problem why
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
do we have to eliminate and fix fix a
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
system that doesn't appear to be broken
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
we I and I you know again I know how you
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
quiet thank you for your comments repres
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
please and do the introduction as well
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh Kate Horan I'm actually putting on
 
01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
another hat I also represent the New
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties so
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
when you are thinking about absentee
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
voting please remember everyone in your
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
nursing home votes absentee not everyone
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
in the nursing home has a photo ID and
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
they may or may not have all of their
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
documents they may be with another
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
family member and right now under the
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
law a nursing home administrator can
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
verify someone's ID so please just think
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
about that because if you require
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
additional documents that means more
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
costs and more work for not only the
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
nursing home but also those in the jail
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
because if you restrict it just cuz
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
about 80% to 90% % of the people who are
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
in your County correctional facilities
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
are their pre-trial they aren't
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
convicted so they still have the right
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
to vote if I happen to live in
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester if I run oh yes did you say
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
80% are pre-trial
 
01:50:43.229 --> 01:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
yes because we only the counties only
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
accept people who have been sentenced to
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
a year or less or are pre-trial so 80 I
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
think the last time I talked to
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County out of
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
pre-trial so I'll just give you an
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
example I happen to live in Manchester
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
if I commit a crime in exiter I'm going
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
to be held in Brentwood the
 
01:51:11.229 --> 01:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent is not going to allow me
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
to leave to go get my birth certificate
 
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
and my documents to vote nor is the
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester Town Clerk going to come to
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
Brentwood to verify my identification I
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
will point out County Corrections in
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes are in a unique
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
position we know who these folks are
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're like oh John Smith
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
is just in bed 18 we know who they are
 
01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
they're likely on Medicare and Medicaid
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
they've been verified by the federal
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
government so please when you guys are
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
looking at those requirements for
 
01:51:45.069 --> 01:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
absentees I suggest you pull your county
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
delegation hat out and put it on and
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
think about the costs that it will
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.629 --> 01:51:57.639 align:start position:0%
and I see a couple questions that I'm
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take yeah I'm just making sure
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
I get this on my notes um because it is
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
it I mean those
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
are that's a good question uh
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham yes thank you uh
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um do
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
you know how many
 
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
um uh inmates actually do vote I absente
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
ballot and I do I'm aware of nursing
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
home this is the first I've heard about
 
01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have numbers but I do know what
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
the superintendant have told me is if
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
they still have their voting rights um
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
then if they ask for an absentee ballot
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
we facilitate that occurring and
 
01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
happening now are some people in the
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
jail for a couple hours are some people
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
in there for significantly longer I know
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County had someone who was in
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
their pre-trial for over two
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
years presumably there would have been
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
an election in there at some point and
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
if he wanted to vote he still had the
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
vote okay uh thank you for taking my
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
question um would you uh distinguish
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
between the County nursing home and
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
other nursing homes that are in the
 
01:53:24.189 --> 01:53:24.199 align:start position:0%
various would not I would suggest that
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem for all 73
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in the state there 73 of
 
01:53:31.149 --> 01:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
them yes and 11 are County nursing homes
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
Coos has
 
01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:35.910 align:start position:0%
Coos has
two

01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
U oh I just was going to point out that
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
um in some cases of misdemeanor somebody
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
may be in there
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
for um uh prison term convicted but are
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
still eligible to vote
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
correct and also um we already have in
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
the RSA somewhere and I don't remember
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
which one it is um considering that the
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
person inside the prison is is
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
considered away from their Hometown
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
correct that is an that is an option on
 
01:54:24.430 --> 01:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
does the subcommittee have any other
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions so um just on the nursing home
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
so because of the Medicade or medic
 
01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare um there's a vetting
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
and identity processing that goes on for
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
people when you when you apply for
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid you have to provide
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
documents Social Security numbers things
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
like that um
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
you our concern is right now so a lot of
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
people who are young adults their
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
parents may have their birth
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
certificates rather than themselves that
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
switches when someone enters a nursing
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
home often times that the nursing home
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
will not hold a birth certificate or a
 
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
marriage certificate or anything like
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be held by the family who
 
01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.790 --> 01:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't think the federal
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
government's going to give out
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
money unless they're very sure that that
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
person I I'm just having applied for
 
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare and having gone and having had
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
to work with Medicaid applications it's
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
honorous they're very detailed and
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
so but no system is perfect
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
I I would suggest to the committee that
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
you consider keeping the exemptions for
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrators to verify
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
someone's identity because again we know
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
who's in the nursing home it's not like
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's Joe Smith because obviously County
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
nursing homes hold the sickest of the
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
sick and the poorest of the poor they
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
still have a right to
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
vote but we know who they are we aren't
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
holding John Doe in the county nurs
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
home because if we don't know who they
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
um they all vot they all vote by
 
01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.470 align:start position:0%
um they all vot they all vote by
absentee

01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
ballot I think
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to say all some you
 
01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
know there are people in the nursing
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
home who can come and go as they please
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
and they can they can go and vote they
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
may not so the uh Hillsboro nursing home
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
is in GF toown they may have maintained
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
their voting rights their domicile in
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
Amherst where they lived and that is
 
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
their their right to do that but they
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
can switch it to gof toown because that
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
live um
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
could you explain that to me um so if
 
01:57:29.069 --> 01:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
they were if they were previously
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
domiciled in and you said Amhurst let's
 
01:57:34.510 --> 01:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
use that example and they're now as a
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
resident of Hillsboro County they're now
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
in the Hillsboro nursing home even
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
though they no longer have a physical
 
01:57:42.639 --> 01:57:43.950 align:start position:0%
though they no longer have a physical
presence

01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
presence
 
01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.830 align:start position:0%
presence
in

01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
in uh Amherst some families choose to
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
cond because let's say the person
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
just physically resides at the Hillsboro
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
County nursing home but they go and they
 
01:58:00.270 --> 01:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
spend every single day with their family
 
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
in Amherst and they're in the community
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
in Amherst and they're still very active
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
in Amherst that's where they want to
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
vote and they as long as they still have
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
a physical address there so let's say
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's the family home they can they can
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
still vote there if they move their
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
physical address to gtown they need to
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
vote in gtown I okay that's that's what
 
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
in case anybody is listening I just want
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that's clear is that
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
because doile is defined by physical
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
presence cor Therefore your explanation
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
then of someone who uh maybe resides
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
overnight yes in a gtown nursing
 
01:58:41.709 --> 01:58:41.719 align:start position:0%
facility um but in fact uh establishes
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
most of their physical presence correct
 
01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
in the town of Amherst in this
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
example meets the doile correct
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
qualification in that circumstance so
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was helpful I
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
believe representative C has
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative C thank you I have a
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for you and this is
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
probably more of an opinion than
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
anything else uh people who are uh uh
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
disabled and confined to their home not
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
a nursing home but just a private
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
residence uh how would you um think they
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
handled I think current the current
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
standard is sufficient because they're
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
leaving the ballot is going to their
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
home why should they need it's
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
unlikely the likelihood of fraud I think
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
is very
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
low and I don't speak for the disabled
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
Community but I believe that they would
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think it we've heard
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
other testimony and it's the the issues
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
with absentee ballot
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
of confirming the that the
 
02:00:15.390 --> 02:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
vote was done by the identified voter
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
and not their neighbor uh or someone
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
like that and that uh and and parallel
 
02:00:26.669 --> 02:00:26.679 align:start position:0%
to that is the chain of custody
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
confirming that in fact
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
that um vote was done it was sealed in
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
the proper ballot and
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
properly uh notorized
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
as as
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
needed U by
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
RSA and that that way we're not treat
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
someone who votes in person has their
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
activities observed and you can track a
 
02:01:00.030 --> 02:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
chain of custody by just witnessing the
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
person walking to the various uh points
 
02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
um that is lost with the use of the
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and so how do you
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
can treat both ballots
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
equivalently and and so I think there
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
there is that aspect and so I think part
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
of what election law has to wrestle with
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
is how do we make sure that that
 
02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
is uh Equitable and the same standard is
 
02:01:29.239 --> 02:01:29.910 align:start position:0%
is uh Equitable and the same standard is
is

02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.669 align:start position:0%
is
maintained

02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
02:01:36.669 --> 02:01:36.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think that's that's the main
 
02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
concern that we have I would argue Mr
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
chair putting back on my secure
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
democracy hat and taking off my County
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
hat for a minute sure um that just
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
because you require someone to provide
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
IDE as in absentee ballot doesn't mean
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
someone else didn't fill out that ballot
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
proof even if you're sending in
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
identification with that absentee ballot
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean my neighbor still
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out the
 
02:02:08.830 --> 02:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
ballot right right and and if if that
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
did happen we should we should be aware
 
02:02:14.069 --> 02:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
of that and we should have that we
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
should properly witnessed and notorized
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
and so I putting my County hat back on
 
02:02:24.189 --> 02:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
fortunately the Secretary of State
 
02:02:31.629 --> 02:02:31.639 align:start position:0%
um governs the notaries and so there
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
might be something we can do about that
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
many states have made it a provision
 
02:02:43.709 --> 02:02:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
notorized so I think but not a required
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
service what's that but not a required
 
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
service is it do they they require the
 
02:02:58.109 --> 02:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
notaries to sign those they disallow
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
charging but they do not
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
require the notary to take that action
 
02:03:06.990 --> 02:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
for those ballots it's two two different
 
02:03:10.069 --> 02:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
issues one is charging for it one is
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
doing the
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
action the notary still has the option
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
not to do the opt not to do that action
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
it okay I'm not
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to remember of what I've
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
read if that's true in all states I'm
 
02:03:28.589 --> 02:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
not sure that
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
is uh due to anti-slavery Provisions in
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
the Constitution I doubt a state can
 
02:03:38.069 --> 02:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
force somebody to take an action and
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
work for no
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
payment perhaps for you can't for you
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
can't for you can't force pro bono I'm
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
sure that there are many people who are
 
02:03:49.679 --> 02:03:52.270 align:start position:0%
sure that there are many people who are
notaries

02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
notaries
 
02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
do it for free but I do not think we
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
cance them to do it for free and we can
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
also authorize other people besides
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
notaries to do it such as these people
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
in the nursing homes um and um and and
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
like we authorize the town clerks
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
because they're not a lot of the Town
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
clerks are not officials yeah election
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
officials are not official notaries so
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
so we could authorize other people so
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to be truly
 
02:04:23.709 --> 02:04:23.719 align:start position:0%
notaries and get that little official
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
stamp I think that's what I'm trying to
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
suggest is that if you're going to
 
02:04:31.149 --> 02:04:31.159 align:start position:0%
require a notary that please include the
 
02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
county superintendent and the County
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home administrators as
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
authorized approvers because they know
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
are because the town clerk is not going
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
to drive over in my example where I get
 
02:04:49.229 --> 02:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
arrested in exiter and I'm held in
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
brenwood the Manchester Town Clerk does
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
not have time to come over and verify my
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
identity the correction superintendent
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
should be able to say yes she is who she
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
says she
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
is agreed I I
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
think right uh representative C I was
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
just thinking we were just dealing with
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
a bill for providing vouchers for uh
 
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
people to get their uh um birth
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
certificates and things like that maybe
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
that could also
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
include uh
 
02:05:25.709 --> 02:05:25.719 align:start position:0%
getting a notary to witness somebody who
 
02:05:25.719 --> 02:05:29.790 align:start position:0%
getting a notary to witness somebody who
cannot

02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.589 --> 02:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
travel yes I I think um again I'm trying
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
to I do believe that there are some
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
states that maybe they have a nominal
 
02:05:40.599 --> 02:05:42.629 align:start position:0%
states that maybe they have a nominal
fee

02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
fee
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and I I think it was in Crawford
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
versus Maran where they did not consider
 
02:05:50.270 --> 02:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
that to be an onerous burden on the
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
voter but uh nor did it um in case
 
02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
anyone was wondering nor did it cross
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
the threshold of a pull
 
02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:01.709 align:start position:0%
the threshold of a pull
tax

02:06:01.709 --> 02:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
um so all right there
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
so I I
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the aspect that there are
 
02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
specific individuals that could be
 
02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
deemed for absentee ballots in these
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
particular situations election officials
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
who would have the responsibility and
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
authority to be able to authenticate a
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
person um and without requiring a notary
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for those who are in
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
other situations traveling you know out
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
of state on business for example
 
02:06:48.669 --> 02:06:48.679 align:start position:0%
something like that um where again that
 
02:06:51.629 --> 02:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
that burden doesn't seem to be
 
02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to the privilege of
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
um any further comments on issue two
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
that aren't that haven't already been
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
said de yes not only it's been dead it's
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the horse does not complain
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
enough that's right um all right so
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
let's move to issue three the
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
non-resident voters
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
so again uh in my and this as
 
02:07:45.069 --> 02:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
representative Newsome has already
 
02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out my problem statements may
 
02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
not always be perfectly worded but I
 
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
will endeavor to um
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
um to lay out the problem so we have
 
02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
persons who use outof state
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
identification but they have a
 
02:08:01.549 --> 02:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
legitimate New Hampshire
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
domicile um and but once they either
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
register or vote um and we heard testony
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State about this
 
02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
they are obligated to fulfill the
 
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
resident requirements and and there have
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
been advisory opinions from the Supreme
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
Court about that as well as um the 2020
 
02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
case of Casey versus New Hampshire
 
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State there
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
were uh five questions asked of the
 
02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court they declined to answer
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
the third one but they did answer the
 
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
other five and uh or the other four of
 
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
those five and one of them certainly uh
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
one if not more of them alluded to the
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
fact that yes once someone votes and
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
exercises that
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
domicile um for voting purposes then
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
they are obligated to fulfill the
 
02:08:52.079 --> 02:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
they are obligated to fulfill the
resident

02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
obligations

02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
um however we we do know from testimony
 
02:09:02.669 --> 02:09:02.679 align:start position:0%
that this that we heard in the Full
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
House on House Bill 133 is
 
02:09:09.669 --> 02:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
that um for those people who did use
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
outof State
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
identifications um there's only been an
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
80 or a 20 to 25% something around those
 
02:09:23.069 --> 02:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
numbers don't hold me to exact numbers
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
please but only a very very minor
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
percentage of those
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
voters who have used an outof state
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
identification have Then followed
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
through on those residency requirements
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
and that is a problem that is a
 
02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.270 align:start position:0%
and that is a problem that is a
non-compliance

02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliance
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
so um you know what's the the problem is
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
that our voting list potentially have
 
02:09:49.950 --> 02:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
people who have not fulfilled their
 
02:09:52.549 --> 02:09:52.559 align:start position:0%
resident obligations
 
02:09:56.669 --> 02:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
and if certainly if someone does this
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
repeatedly this this is a a willful
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
disregard of the residency requirements
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
and I think something that could in fact
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
constitute voter fraud you you're always
 
02:10:09.709 --> 02:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
looking for voter fraud there you go I
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
I've laid out a possible case for one
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
one possible case yes um which I would
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
May argue but we'll get to that later so
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
and and we do know we do know in the
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
last election that there were
 
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
4,812 outof state driver's licenses used
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
and so um again I think that's I'm sorry
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
what was that number again
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
4,812 I believe that is correct um about
 
02:10:35.599 --> 02:10:37.069 align:start position:0%
4,812 I believe that is correct um about
approximately

02:10:37.069 --> 02:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
approximately and
 
02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.709 align:start position:0%
approximately and
um

02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
so you know if we
 
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
have only 20% of that
 
02:10:49.549 --> 02:10:49.559 align:start position:0%
complying that would
 
02:10:52.549 --> 02:10:52.559 align:start position:0%
be uh now I'm required to do high level
 
02:10:56.549 --> 02:10:56.559 align:start position:0%
math here about a thousand yeah so about
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
a thousand so that
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
would if these people failed to continue
 
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
to act and continued to vote there there
 
02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
you would have and had a requirement to
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
get a license and had a requirement to
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
get a
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
license or had already had a
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
license um
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
then uh such persons would
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
be um potentially again I get a series
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
of circumstances that have to they all
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
have to come together it has to be a
 
02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
perfect storm of
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
concurrences um and I I'm redundant
 
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
there sorry uh they even so at those
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate uh case of voter fraud or you
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
maybe may be inadvertent and unaware but
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh ignorance is not uh excuse I
 
02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
suppose all right so what is the
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
proposed solution at least from my
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
perspective well I think first it it's
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to increase awareness
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
of the residency requirements and
 
02:12:14.719 --> 02:12:16.270 align:start position:0%
of the residency requirements and
implications

02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
implications
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
and um I think it's also important that
 
02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
we identify residency requirements on
 
02:12:24.669 --> 02:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
the voter registration forms that that
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
people sign but without making the forms
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily complex I think the you
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
know the court case for
 
02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
sb3 I believe had uh comments along
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
those lines that that sp3 had created
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
complex registration forms and therefore
 
02:12:44.719 --> 02:12:45.549 align:start position:0%
complex registration forms and therefore
made

02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
it uh difficult for voters to understand
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
um you know we we simply need
 
02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:59.709 align:start position:0%
um you know we we simply need
to

02:12:59.709 --> 02:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
um provide simple statements about uh
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
your your active uh registration and
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
voting uh requires that you fulfill New
 
02:13:14.910 --> 02:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state residency requirements
 
02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
which may
 
02:13:15.670 --> 02:13:17.229 align:start position:0%
which may
[Music]

02:13:17.229 --> 02:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
include uh transferring a current
 
02:13:25.629 --> 02:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other similar activities
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
something along those
 
02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:31.629 align:start position:0%
something along those
lines

02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things that we
 
02:13:34.199 --> 02:13:35.109 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things that we
could

02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
do uh in the and make it more clear in
 
02:13:42.669 --> 02:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
the RSA about these sorts of
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
implications um is to Define some of
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
these uh aspects in under eligibility
 
02:13:52.119 --> 02:13:52.910 align:start position:0%
these uh aspects in under eligibility
and

02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
then um uh specified in the voter
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
qualifications and registration forms in
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
those sections of the RSA as well again
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
without making them unnecessarily
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
complex so as to make registration a
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
burden but um so I would I would propose
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
something U maybe under eligibility to
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
add something to the effect of the
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
active registration or voting requires
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
the register or voter to comply with the
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
residency requirements for New Hampshire
 
02:14:24.750 --> 02:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
compliance with New Hampshire residency
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
requirements is considered a verifiable
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
Act of intent to make the place
 
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
designated by the registrant to doile is
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
claimed and then failure to comply with
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
the residency of requirements of New
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law invalidates any claim to
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
establish a physical place of presence
 
02:14:43.069 --> 02:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
with an intent to make that place a
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
domicile and re renders the registrant
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
as unqualified for the purposes of
 
02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
voting in future elections until as such
 
02:14:53.229 --> 02:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
time the residents requirements are met
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
continued failure to comply with the
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
residency requirements of New Hampshire
 
02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
law is considered a willful violation of
 
02:15:02.109 --> 02:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
the election laws of the
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
state again I think again I've tried to
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
laid out a series of circumstances where
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
one is you know for whatever reason they
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
haven't complied but compliance is not
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily fraud and we had that
 
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier today and I'm I'm not
 
02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.270 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier today and I'm I'm not
looking

02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
looking
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
to cast dispersions on someone who has
 
02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
not been compliant as if they were
 
02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
committing fraud I'm simply trying to
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those two levels but
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
someone who continues to violate this is
 
02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
really at that
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
point not just merely not complying but
 
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
actually in you know committing voter
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
fraud at that point and so I think we
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
need to be clear about this under the
 
02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
eligibility aspects and then uh make the
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
proper uh changes to the voter
 
02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
qualification registration form sections
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the RSA in order to address that um
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
and so I would propose uh for example
 
02:16:02.669 --> 02:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll try and provide some
 
02:16:07.589 --> 02:16:07.599 align:start position:0%
amendments to uh my bill 289 to remove
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
the aspects that we discussed earlier
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
today but then to add these sorts of
 
02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
residency requirements under eligibility
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
again not again
 
02:16:22.990 --> 02:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
explaining you know dool is what is
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
needed to qualify but
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
that that act of voting or registration
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
then kicks in residency requirements
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
because I think that's
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
fair representative Lane I I guess I
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't agree with you um I'll
 
02:16:39.709 --> 02:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree I do not think
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
that the fact that you um if you satisfy
 
02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
and register and you show domicile and
 
02:16:48.270 --> 02:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
done everything the fact that you choose
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
not to get a New Hampshire driver's
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
license or that you choose to not get uh
 
02:16:58.429 --> 02:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
the non driver identification should not
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's not should not make take away your
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
right to vote which is the most
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
important right you have if you make
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
those choices it in no way is saying
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
that you're committing fraud all you're
 
02:17:14.910 --> 02:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
doing is not complying with other laws
 
02:17:17.790 --> 02:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and if if they want to
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
share that list with DMV and DMV wants
 
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
to go after those people for the for a
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
violation of that law go at it but you
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
don't take away people's right to vote
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
simply because they don't go out to DMV
 
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
and get a driver's license or what other
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
residency requirements are I don't even
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
know because one of my questions was
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
what are the other residency
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and I'm not trying to be
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
funny I I just honestly don't know if
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
there are other ones that were that I'm
 
02:17:51.910 --> 02:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
not aware of um and you know like
 
02:17:54.270 --> 02:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
registering your car maybe a lot of
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
people don't have the
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
money to register their car and so they
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
are forced to take the chance um that
 
02:18:05.309 --> 02:18:05.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get caught and and
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
I guess you know we all learn from our
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
own experience but you know I worked in
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
legal aid for nine years I mean my
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
clients they they can't I mean trying to
 
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
come up with 50 extra dollars at the end
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
of the week was a huge burden taking
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
time off to go to the clerk's office or
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
to go to DMV and stand in line for two
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
hours is just something they can't do
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
they're most of them are taking care of
 
02:18:35.950 --> 02:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
somebody or they're me they have mental
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
health issues I mean there's a myriad of
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances that you know fortunately
 
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
most of us don't have but a lot of
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
people in this state do and it's been
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
consistent stantly I can't remember who
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
did this survey but most people in the
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
United States and I don't know I can't
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
remember the percentage but it's a
 
02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
really high percentage of people who
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't have 400 who a $400 expense
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
unexpected they can't cover it so which
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
is why I get so worked up about the
 
02:19:15.389 --> 02:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
passport and all these extra cost
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people in our state do
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
not have those and but that doesn't mean
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be able to vote and so
 
02:19:25.349 --> 02:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
the more barriers and the more
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
requirements we put up the more people
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
we are not allowing to
 
02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:31.830 align:start position:0%
we are not allowing to
vote

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:19:34.509 --> 02:19:34.519 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't I think we have to
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
think very carefully before we start
 
02:19:38.669 --> 02:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
saying oh because you didn't get a
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
driver's license or you didn't register
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
your car you are not g to you were not
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to be allowed to vote I'm not sure
 
02:19:48.590 --> 02:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
that would stand up in court but you
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
know I'm not a lawyer anymore so I I
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know but I just think we
 
02:19:55.389 --> 02:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
have to think about those things before
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
we go off and say oh let's do
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislation about this so and one of the
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
things I was thinking about with a lot
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
of these bills is should we retain
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
them and because I mean realistically we
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
have what two weeks a week five days not
 
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
much time to to improve these bills in
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
light of all that we've heard so do we
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
select a few to retain and work on them
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
and get them at least to the point where
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're not having to listen to me say
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
this over and over
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
you yes representative C uh we we do
 
02:20:38.190 --> 02:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
need to consider the possibility of
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
people not having any photo ID at all
 
02:20:44.670 --> 02:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
and it's not actually a requirement for
 
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
living to have an
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
ID uh if they don't drive if they don't
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
own a car car if they don't need to go
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
buy a beer you know they just don't need
 
02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:57.670 align:start position:0%
buy a beer you know they just don't need
an

02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
ID and that's they can legally live
 
02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
way yes
 
02:21:11.790 --> 02:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
we again I we we run up against that
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
kind of non-driver identification
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:21.359 --> 02:21:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
vernham I just had a comment to make
 
02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
because I mean with all these
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
identification Social Security and all
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
of that I when uh my children were still
 
02:21:36.590 --> 02:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
young and my oldest was about to get a
 
02:21:39.389 --> 02:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
job a summer job I realized I could not
 
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
find their social security cards in the
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
midst of my whatever I don't know what
 
02:21:47.950 --> 02:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
happened because those are issued based
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
upon the birth certificate right that
 
02:21:52.469 --> 02:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
all kind happens at the same time and
 
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
then you don't use them unless you have
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
insurance that you need to write down
 
02:21:58.590 --> 02:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
their social security number and that's
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
about it that I know could recall uh
 
02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
maybe if you sent them to school I'm not
 
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
sure but because I homeschooled but um
 
02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
however so when I when I lost in my
 
02:22:13.710 --> 02:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
house there's social security guards and
 
02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
I knew I had to get this cuz in a few
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
months she was going to start a job and
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
she would need that so I took my
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
children to the Social Security office
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
which just getting inside was a
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
complete circus with my children so um
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
the problem that I came to is that I
 
02:22:37.309 --> 02:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.030 --> 02:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
children I had their birth certificate
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
with my name on it and their name on it
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
but I did not have a photo
 
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
ID which was kind of interesting because
 
02:22:50.670 --> 02:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
I thought well I mean I homeschool told
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
them I didn't need a photo ID or a
 
02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
school ID for them so
 
02:22:59.830 --> 02:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
um I can see why this is like an issue
 
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know proof of verification but this
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
was a this was and this I had to go back
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
a couple times they were not willing to
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
just give them a copy of their social
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
security card so um but I think that
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's important why I say this it's it's
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to make sure that
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
we're verifying people who are are who
 
02:23:22.510 --> 02:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
they say they are when they're voting
 
02:23:25.269 --> 02:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's just as important what that answer
 
02:23:28.269 --> 02:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
is what that what the final solution is
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure because we kind of just run
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
around and beat every possible uh idea
 
02:23:38.269 --> 02:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
but um it is it is very difficult to
 
02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
prove someone's
 
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
identity even if they were to create one
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
themselves CU then that's not really
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
government or legitimate however I think
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
could it be possible that and I know
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
this might be I'm just throwing it out
 
02:23:57.710 --> 02:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
there but wherever they are and I'm not
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
I'm excluding the county issue but
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
wherever the people are residing is that
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
something where they can maybe have some
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
type of identity from the clerk's office
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
I mean we get their we're registering
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
there we pay for our dog licensing which
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
is coming up and all this stuff like is
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
this another possibility that you know
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
if we are visiting there and you know
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
most people have driver's license most
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
people have ident this would be a rare
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
few but did did this did this topic come
 
02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
up about possibly having some type of
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
verification through the clerk's office
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard it somewhere I can't
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
really recall but is this do you think
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
this could be a
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
possibility I think it was Mr uh Clement
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
totz who brought it up in his testimony
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
at one point I don't remember which Bill
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
he was testifying on but I think that's
 
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
where I kind of got the idea when he
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned something like that but I
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't know for
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
sure I I know I heard it so thank you I
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure but and and the thing is
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
like birth certificates you can get real
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
easy now because it's all been logged in
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that pretty much right like it's on a
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
database are exceptions yeah okay
 
02:25:17.309 --> 02:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
there's always exceptions not everybody
 
02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
lives the same I get it but I mean that
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
is a available um you know so if there
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
are those documents available in the and
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
we can have something available at the
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to verify I don't know if
 
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's another option to
 
02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
consider representative new um according
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
to my notes that was on house built 618
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
when we heard that idea and I don't know
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
who it was from but it was 618 I have in
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
my not it might have been you bring it
 
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
it might have been you bringing it up at
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
the time too but it was worthy enough
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
that I wrote a note about it so so I I
 
02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
think uh and I'm doing this from memory
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
but if I if I'm not mistaken in some of
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
the court cases that we heard about um
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion that at one
 
02:26:10.750 --> 02:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
point there were some states that
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
limited or or that you know historically
 
02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
limited their Wards to 250 people so
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
someone could ostensibly know everyone
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
there uh those days perhaps are gone um
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
but I think um even so I think you know
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting aspect of if we're
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
wanting someone to be identified at a
 
02:26:40.469 --> 02:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
ward then what can we do to facilitate
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
the identification at that Ward through
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
the town clerk that or the clerk's
 
02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
office there that that is an interesting
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
so all
 
02:27:00.190 --> 02:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
right represent new some followup there
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you on um slightly different well
 
02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
for on the sheet um believe it or not
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm actually G to have something good to
 
02:27:07.070 --> 02:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
say about
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
it on uh under proposed solution you
 
02:27:11.790 --> 02:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
have the increased awareness of Resident
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
requirements and
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
implications um I think that's a great
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
idea and I don't know if it would be as
 
02:27:20.429 --> 02:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
simple as a handout that the ballot
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
clerks could give somebody when they do
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
use that out of state ID that's a great
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
idea uh something like that would be
 
02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
great um and then getting back to
 
02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's comments about how
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
a DMV
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
violation shouldn't rise
 
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
to the where where the penalty should
 
02:27:41.950 --> 02:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
not be to remove your right to vote I
 
02:27:43.469 --> 02:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
guess another way that I was kind of
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that through and an analogy
 
02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
would be that you get a speeding ticket
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
right and you're no longer allowed to
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
possess a firearm
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
interesting that it's a DMV violation
 
02:27:56.910 --> 02:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
and a constitutional right being taken
 
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
away and I like that analogy actually I
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
I doubt anyone would feel confident and
 
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a speeding ticket
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
taking away your right to gun ownership
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
right I know I wouldn't want my guns
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
yes I I do
 
02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that how do we deal with this
 
02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
issue of ongoing
 
02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
non-compliance that's the challenge and
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's the the DMV and I don't
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
know if there are ways to communicate
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
that back and forth through local level
 
02:28:36.910 --> 02:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
reports up to the Secretary State who
 
02:28:38.590 --> 02:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
then talks to
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
DMV um and again the other problem is
 
02:28:45.030 --> 02:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
that as the testimony we heard is
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
that just because you don't get the New
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license doesn't mean
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
mean you're not in
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
compliance that we that there are
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances of not driving in
 
02:29:00.910 --> 02:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
the state not owning a car in the state
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
where you can be residents domiciled
 
02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
whatever words they all are um that may
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be the same um even
 
02:29:12.269 --> 02:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
with all that you still don't need to
 
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
have a New Hampshire driver's license
 
02:29:16.469 --> 02:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
and I think as representative C said you
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't need an ID to live your life so
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
again not getting
 
02:29:26.269 --> 02:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
one it is not Prima evidence of
 
02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
violations so it it is a challenge and I
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
02:29:33.269 --> 02:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
know what the answer is and I certainly
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
don't think we can come up with an
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
answer in the next week uh to to make a
 
02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh a bill amendment to to solve that
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
this this term
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
so it's funny we've by law we've
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
combined the concepts of domicile and
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
Resident but then we need to continually
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
separate them in for enforcement
 
02:30:18.359 --> 02:30:20.429 align:start position:0%
separate them in for enforcement
purposes

02:30:20.429 --> 02:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
oddly enough because as you said
 
02:30:27.309 --> 02:30:27.319 align:start position:0%
it the doile can be
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
maintained and someone
 
02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.389 align:start position:0%
maintained and someone
[Music]

02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:32.349 --> 02:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
can again
 
02:30:36.670 --> 02:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:39.309 --> 02:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
maintained for voting purposes they
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
still have their physical presence but
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:50.230 --> 02:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
requirements at that point is has to be
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
sort of distinguished from the
 
02:30:55.550 --> 02:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to
 
02:30:58.670 --> 02:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
vote yeah the the way I think about it
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
is what is the definition for voter
 
02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
registration or voter residency as
 
02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to other types so DMV residency
 
02:31:14.269 --> 02:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
UNH residency so that that term can be
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
used in a lot of different context and
 
02:31:19.990 --> 02:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't always mean the same thing and I
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
think it's we T I know I tend to want to
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
put lump things like resident means
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
resident and every single the same thing
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
in every single situation but that's
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
really not what we have and I think
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's why they finally gave up and said
 
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
Domino domicile and residents with
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
respect to voting are the same but but
 
02:31:45.150 --> 02:31:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's not the same when you look at DMV
 
02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
or un UNH you know whether you're going
 
02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
to get to pay instate tuition or not and
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
there's probably other requ other ones
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
out there I just don't know um but
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's we shouldn't fall into the Trap of
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
trying to say that the word resonant
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
mean or residency or whichever one we're
 
02:32:10.030 --> 02:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
using means the same thing in every
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
context and that's and I think
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's part of the education process for
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
everybody um and I think handing out
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
that thing might be a good idea and to
 
02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
educate people and it could also be that
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
um the SOS and
 
02:32:30.269 --> 02:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
DMV um can work together to to do
 
02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
something like that I don't know if they
 
02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
have a link or not I I can't figure that
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
out I think they do I think that I think
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
also that house bill 133 was meant to
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
address some of these aspects so
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
um all right all right so I think um but
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.429 --> 02:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
Residency has multiple
 
02:32:59.439 --> 02:33:04.590 align:start position:0%
Residency has multiple
definitions

02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
um or or or you that's not the right way
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
to say it maybe is you can you can have
 
02:33:11.399 --> 02:33:13.230 align:start position:0%
to say it maybe is you can you can have
multiple

02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
residences um but for voting purposes
 
02:33:18.309 --> 02:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
you can't have multiple
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
domiciles um
 
02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's confusing so
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:33:31.750 --> 02:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
SE I know we have a a u provision in the
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
RSA stating that uh voting uh doile for
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
voting purposes but that always sort of
 
02:33:41.950 --> 02:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
annoyed me because as I see it you can
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
only have one domicile for all your
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
purposes and you can change it whenever
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
you need to but at any one given time
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
you can only have one and that but
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's just my feeling I don't know
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
whether there's any legal basis for that
 
02:34:01.389 --> 02:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's very interesting if you
 
02:34:01.399 --> 02:34:03.070 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's very interesting if you
read

02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
read
 
02:34:06.190 --> 02:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
through like for instance tax
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
law you can have someone who has a
 
02:34:11.070 --> 02:34:11.080 align:start position:0%
temporary absence from an address for
 
02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:13.830 align:start position:0%
temporary absence from an address for
education

02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
purposes um and you can have I think
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's a reference where you can have a
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
do I think this is in the rsas as well
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
you can have a domicile for voting
 
02:34:26.429 --> 02:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
purposes and also have a temporary
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
absence from that
 
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
domicile um that's
 
02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:34.230 align:start position:0%
domicile um that's
yeah

02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:34:37.389 --> 02:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
Services yeah arm Services yeah armed
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
services usually the one that most
 
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
people ring up are people who go do
 
02:34:42.750 --> 02:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
residencies doctors who go do
 
02:34:45.550 --> 02:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
residencies and it's the other example
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
they always come up with I can't
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:57.269 --> 02:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I think it's
 
02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh and and because the state each
 
02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
state implements these things
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
independently with just having to align
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
as as required with Federal requirements
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
if they're applicable or
 
02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:17.349 align:start position:0%
if they're applicable or
not

02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
um again it's it's it's
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
very confusing uh for that reason
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
because you you I think
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
you I don't think other states are
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
wrestling with they don't use the word
 
02:35:33.870 --> 02:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
dool let me put it that way there there
 
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
are other states that don't use the word
 
02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:38.030 align:start position:0%
are other states that don't use the word
domicile

02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
domicile
 
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
so um and and maybe that's part of it we
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
need to think about how we how we uh
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
change that I think that's what really
 
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
is behind the suggestion by Mr Richard
 
02:35:53.469 --> 02:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
for moving toward a New Hampshire
 
02:35:53.479 --> 02:35:55.670 align:start position:0%
for moving toward a New Hampshire
citizen

02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
voter all right any are there any other
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
comments on the non-resident voter
 
02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
issue they haven't been said before that
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
this hasn't been said before I'm not
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the term non-resident voters
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
is very is good because if you're not a
 
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
resident you shouldn't be voting so it
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
kind of implies
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
so I would just
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
say I don't know I don't know what title
 
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
I would come up with but when I first
 
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
read it I went how can we have
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
non-resident voters if they're a
 
02:36:31.349 --> 02:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
non-resident voter then they're
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
committing fraud well I you know how how
 
02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
can we have voters who use who are
 
02:36:38.190 --> 02:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire who use out of
 
02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire who use out of
state

02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
identification because they're just
 
02:36:43.309 --> 02:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
proving who they are they're not proving
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
that they live they can prove how that
 
02:36:46.990 --> 02:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
they live in New Hampshire in other ways
 
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.309 --> 02:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
possibly representative C possibly the
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
title could be uh voters with
 
02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:06.950 align:start position:0%
title could be uh voters with
non-resident

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
identifications yes
 
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
I uh I inherited that title uh because
 
02:37:17.429 --> 02:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
that was the subcommittee's title given
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
to me just so you know so so just um I
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
do try and be very careful in my wording
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
but sometimes I inherit things that
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
are well we are trying to make sure that
 
02:37:33.670 --> 02:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
the non-resident voters don't vote in
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
exactly um all
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
right while allowing the residents to
 
02:37:44.349 --> 02:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
vote in the state
 
02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
yes yes absolutely all right
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
we've uh talked about those three
 
02:37:54.399 --> 02:38:01.830 align:start position:0%
we've uh talked about those three
things

02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:04.389 --> 02:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
um let's uh the the fourth one is
 
02:38:07.269 --> 02:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots all right
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
so I I think again this is just my my
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
perception thinking about this late at
 
02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
night but trying to take into
 
02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
account all the testimony we've heard
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
the court cases I've
 
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh the research that we've been
 
02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
presented currently and and we and we
 
02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:36.389 --> 02:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
State testify that he felt that that
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
there were some aspects of the absentee
 
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
ballot process I won't
 
02:38:46.150 --> 02:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
say you registration and obtaining a
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
ballot but that may
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
be um
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and and we heard Mr Richard's testimony
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
about the affidavit aspects of that that
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
could be tightened up so I think um I
 
02:39:03.269 --> 02:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
think the problem I see is that absentee
 
02:39:04.990 --> 02:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
ballots May currently be obtained by
 
02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
non-registered voters so they can
 
02:39:09.309 --> 02:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
request a ballot even if they haven't
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
registered yet I believe that's correct
 
02:39:14.190 --> 02:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
and then they have to prove they have to
 
02:39:19.510 --> 02:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
they have to provide the qualifications
 
02:39:25.269 --> 02:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
again I have to uh confirm that but I
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
think that's possible I thought there
 
02:39:30.269 --> 02:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
was a process to register
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
absentee which is separate and distinct
 
02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
from requesting the absentee ballot and
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
this is again one of the and I found the
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
same issue when I was going through this
 
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
stuff is conflating the different steps
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
in the process between registration
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
requesting the ballot and then returning
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the ballot yes as
 
02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
different things and it and it it is
 
02:39:55.710 --> 02:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
hard to keep track of yeah well I I I I
 
02:39:58.750 --> 02:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
mean uh I don't want to suggest
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
something wildly crazy but I think it
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
might be it might be helpful at some
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
point to even think you know much as you
 
02:40:08.670 --> 02:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
did with the finance aspects last year
 
02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
is to just think about a overhaul where
 
02:40:14.269 --> 02:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
we would distinguish yeah I know sorry
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
where we would distinguish those two
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
activities more clearly than the rsa's
 
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
do now now um because I do think there
 
02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
is confusion about
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
that um and
 
02:40:27.439 --> 02:40:29.070 align:start position:0%
that um and
I

02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.030 --> 02:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
so all right with all right so without
 
02:40:38.990 --> 02:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
an election official sign off you know a
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
clerk signing an envelope for a voter
 
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
submitting an in for example a clerk
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
signing it like I I've done this at my
 
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
own in my own town i' I've know I was
 
02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to be away on business travel I
 
02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
went in the week prior obtained an
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot filled it out there
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
signed all the necessary forms and
 
02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
handed it directly to the clerk so you
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
know there was full chain of custody
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
full identification I had already
 
02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
registered so no issues there
 
02:41:15.309 --> 02:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
um but as we heard from Mr Richard's
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
testimony uh there are some absentee
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
ballots that don't have a formal
 
02:41:21.550 --> 02:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
confirmation of the voting by the
 
02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
identified voter there's a self
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
attestation I think is how he
 
02:41:30.469 --> 02:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
characterized it um but there's not a a
 
02:41:30.479 --> 02:41:32.030 align:start position:0%
characterized it um but there's not a a
thirdparty

02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
thirdparty
 
02:41:36.030 --> 02:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
such as a election official public
 
02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:37.790 align:start position:0%
such as a election official public
notary

02:41:37.790 --> 02:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
notary
 
02:41:40.429 --> 02:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
other uh individuals who might be you
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
know we certainly heard from Miss Horan
 
02:41:47.190 --> 02:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
um you know uh County Corrections
 
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
administrators uh nursing home admin
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
ministrators who might be able to do
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
something in in those
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
situations uh you know could
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
authenticate that that voter made you
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
know again for someone who was disabled
 
02:42:04.230 --> 02:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh because we we do want to take into
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
account that situation if that they
 
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
could indicate their vote to a third
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
party who then completed the vote the
 
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
ballot on their behalf and then again
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
had all of that documented so that you
 
02:42:20.830 --> 02:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
know were sufficiently documented so
 
02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
that it it was shown very
 
02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:24.790 align:start position:0%
that it it was shown very
clearly

02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
um that the circumstances of of that
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
vote uh has uh in authenticity and
 
02:42:36.269 --> 02:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
integrity and and it's documented and
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
the moderator when they receive that
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and then have to count
 
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:50.030 --> 02:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate all right um
 
02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:51.389 align:start position:0%
appropriate all right um
so

02:42:51.389 --> 02:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
I uh so again the two aspects are simply
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
that there's not a formal confirmation
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
of the voting by the identified voter
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a loss of any chain of
 
02:43:04.269 --> 02:43:04.279 align:start position:0%
custody confirming the Integrity of the
 
02:43:04.279 --> 02:43:05.550 align:start position:0%
custody confirming the Integrity of the
absentee

02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
ballot um what's the adverse impact is
 
02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the Integrity of some ABS ballot is
 
02:43:14.750 --> 02:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
suspect uh when there's a lack of the
 
02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
confirmation or or an insufficient chain
 
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
of custody
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
um you know some possibilities things
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
would be absentee B ballot absentee
 
02:43:29.710 --> 02:43:29.720 align:start position:0%
voters must pre-register in person now
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
again I think we would have to take into
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
account the uh Corrections facilities
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
nursing homes things like
 
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
that uh if the absentee voter fails to
 
02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
provide the documents necessary for
 
02:43:46.429 --> 02:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
registration um you know what would we
 
02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
do would we treat them like a u aava
 
02:43:48.359 --> 02:43:49.750 align:start position:0%
do would we treat them like a u aava
voter

02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
voter
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh quite possibly because at that point
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's no other choice we don't want to
 
02:43:58.269 --> 02:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
deny them the opportunity to vote but
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
simply you know we don't
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
have all the documentation necessary so
 
02:44:07.309 --> 02:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
I do think um especially after Mr
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
Richard's testimony I do think we need
 
02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
to uh explore creating a a voter
 
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
authentication affidavit envelope um
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
something that election official or a
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
public notary or you know a uh
 
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections Facility administrator or
 
02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home facility administrator
 
02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:31.349 align:start position:0%
nursing home facility administrator
could

02:44:31.349 --> 02:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:44:31.359 --> 02:44:33.070 align:start position:0%
could
sign

02:44:33.070 --> 02:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
sign
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know uh thereby
 
02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
identify um you know uh what the that
 
02:44:44.309 --> 02:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
the voting has occurred
 
02:44:46.750 --> 02:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
properly so I think those
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
are I think the two
 
02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh um things is you know you we modify
 
02:44:57.870 --> 02:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
the envelope and I apologize my computer
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh key for e is C giving me problems and
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
I see all the typos here and I apologize
 
02:45:08.269 --> 02:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
for that but it's like uh again some of
 
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
them envelop is a word but it it it was
 
02:45:15.110 --> 02:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
meant to be envelope so um if you see
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
under proposed changes so it was not
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
caught by spell check unfortunately
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
spell check yeah and the is still a word
 
02:45:25.030 --> 02:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
um from uh the old English
 
02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:27.030 align:start position:0%
um from uh the old English
language

02:45:27.030 --> 02:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:45:30.510 --> 02:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
so uh again things not caught during
 
02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:31.910 align:start position:0%
so uh again things not caught during
spell

02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
spell
 
02:45:35.230 --> 02:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
check so I think uh those are the two
 
02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
things that I see as as helping to
 
02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
improve the absentee ballot
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
situation um there are changes that
 
02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
would have to be made in a number of
 
02:45:49.469 --> 02:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
cases I think there's um good support in
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
in some of the other cases referenced
 
02:45:54.429 --> 02:45:54.439 align:start position:0%
again it was starting to get uh very
 
02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
very late at that point and so um so I
 
02:46:02.269 --> 02:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
additional considerations is to limit uh
 
02:46:04.269 --> 02:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
the deadline for receiving absentee
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
ballot request by mail simply because
 
02:46:09.389 --> 02:46:09.399 align:start position:0%
there's not time to return it at that
 
02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
point um and require a completed
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
registration prior to dispensing with an
 
02:46:20.590 --> 02:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot if again um I may need I
 
02:46:22.150 --> 02:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
probably do need to double check that
 
02:46:24.990 --> 02:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
again I may have conflated registration
 
02:46:28.110 --> 02:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
with obtaining a ballot but uh for for
 
02:46:30.990 --> 02:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot aspect so I think
 
02:46:34.030 --> 02:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
those are some potential Solutions along
 
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
those lines um thoughts and
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
comments representative Burnham yes I do
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
have a comment this actually occurred
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I I hope that I'm speaking
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
on this in the proper
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
way that I saw it was um I was helping
 
02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
with the absentee ballots as far as
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
getting them prepared and um one
 
02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:00.469 align:start position:0%
getting them prepared and um one
individual

02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
um had requested an absentee ballot the
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
Monday prior which is fine however was
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
not a registered voter so then had to
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
come in Tuesday to
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
register and then provider absentee
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
ballot so I kind of thought it was a
 
02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
little strange
 
02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously this may not happen
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
very often but is that proper procedure
 
02:47:27.790 --> 02:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
if she came in to register but still
 
02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
submitted the absentee
 
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
ballot I would think that when they show
 
02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
up in person they should be tossing
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
their absentee and getting a Same Day
 
02:47:41.630 --> 02:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
quote unquote regular is what I would
 
02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:43.030 align:start position:0%
quote unquote regular is what I would
think

02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
but I as school moderator I don't deal
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
with elections the way that the town
 
02:47:49.630 --> 02:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
moderator does I'm still the election
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
official and do the counting but that
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
kind of call would be the town
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
moderator's call at least in my town um
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
but that's an interesting scenario
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for sharing that yeah and he did
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
call it he he checked on and verified
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
yep she registered and they accepted the
 
02:48:07.469 --> 02:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot but I just thought it
 
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
was I felt the same way if you could
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
come to register why not just vote but
 
02:48:14.110 --> 02:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
that was just kind of one of those
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
really strange things that happened with
 
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
but in theory it's the same questions
 
02:48:19.630 --> 02:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
the same ovals
 
02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:21.070 align:start position:0%
the same ovals
so

02:48:21.070 --> 02:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's kind of a no difference in the
 
02:48:25.870 --> 02:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
end that the ovals are still getting
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
counted the same way but it is it is an
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
odd situation and I think less important
 
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
in a town where the ballots are the
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
same but other and if some of the other
 
02:48:41.950 --> 02:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
balloting pre certific pre certificate
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
questions come into play that could have
 
02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
different answers and could be I I would
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
almost uh suggest your moderator reach
 
02:48:52.349 --> 02:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
out to the municipal Association and add
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
that to the training seminar uh because
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
that is an interesting one that I bet
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
happens elsewhere
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
too yeah I think there there are some
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions about whether you would treat
 
02:49:05.550 --> 02:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
that as the absentee ballot as a spoiled
 
02:49:08.230 --> 02:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
ballot at that point and
 
02:49:14.630 --> 02:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
then um and then you void that and
 
02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
then request the person to vote in
 
02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:20.110 align:start position:0%
then request the person to vote in
person

02:49:20.110 --> 02:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
um again plans change so it's you know
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
if someone thought they would be away
 
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
and filled it out with they weren
 
02:49:30.429 --> 02:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
registered so yeah so right so there's a
 
02:49:33.750 --> 02:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
lot of how did they get a ballot without
 
02:49:38.229 --> 02:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
registering see so that's that's what
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about someone got an
 
02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and they weren't I did
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk that I said to them why
 
02:49:45.309 --> 02:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
did you give a ballot if they weren't
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
registered I I don't I might be missing
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
something but that's just the scenario
 
02:49:54.670 --> 02:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
that was presented one no I'm just
 
02:49:56.349 --> 02:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
kidding no that is a very serious
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't mean to diminish
 
02:50:01.269 --> 02:50:01.279 align:start position:0%
that at all but I mean obviously that
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
would have been checked by the
 
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
supervisor checklist that morning who
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
goes through to verify the absentee
 
02:50:09.150 --> 02:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
ballots but I just thought why would
 
02:50:11.309 --> 02:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
that be even entertained from the
 
02:50:13.910 --> 02:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
beginning right it possibly a similar
 
02:50:15.229 --> 02:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
name with somebody already on the
 
02:50:18.030 --> 02:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
registry I the the mean I'm not going to
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
speculate on that right the mechanism
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
should be no ballots unless registered
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
so um representative C I know you have
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh some ideas here that you want to
 
02:50:31.469 --> 02:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
share with us well first I wanted to
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on on the conversation we were
 
02:50:36.190 --> 02:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
just having here please do is uh my
 
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of the reason
 
02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
for uh having the absentee ballots
 
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
processed after like 11:00 a.m. or some
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
particular time is so that a person who
 
02:50:48.229 --> 02:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
thought there were going to be away
 
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
mailed in an absentee ballot but then is
 
02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
able to come in can come in before the
 
02:50:55.830 --> 02:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are started and they
 
02:50:58.830 --> 02:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
can mark them as being voting in person
 
02:50:59.950 --> 02:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
02:51:03.550 --> 02:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
absentee that's my understanding
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
too isn't it possible though that you
 
02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:07.429 align:start position:0%
too isn't it possible though that you
can

02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:51:09.950 --> 02:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
still and I'm I've been reading all
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
these new statutes so I'm a little the
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
existing statute can you not because I
 
02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
know we heard testimony from a couple
 
02:51:21.070 --> 02:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
the clerks that they send them to people
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
by email I mean that that they're
 
02:51:27.550 --> 02:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
requested by email so it could be that
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
under the existing law that they ask for
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
the full package registration and
 
02:51:37.070 --> 02:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
everything and then I I don't know it
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
just I I can't remember what the I I'm
 
02:51:43.030 --> 02:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to say I can remember I it
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
is it is complicated it gets conflated
 
02:51:47.309 --> 02:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
and I think we need
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:51:53.990 --> 02:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
review that and make sure that we
 
02:51:57.349 --> 02:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh separate those two those two
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
activities for absentee ballots more
 
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:09.190 --> 02:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
I I do think
 
02:52:12.830 --> 02:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
that that fraud could occur I I want to
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
be careful in my phrasings for the uh
 
02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
esteemed representatives to my left I
 
02:52:23.229 --> 02:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
want I want to so it is important
 
02:52:23.239 --> 02:52:26.269 align:start position:0%
want I want to so it is important
that

02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.389 --> 02:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
the B an absentee ballot never be sent
 
02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
out to someone who is not
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
registered because that has a potential
 
02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:37.070 align:start position:0%
registered because that has a potential
for

02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:52:40.910 --> 02:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
fraud and uh
 
02:52:43.710 --> 02:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
so uh you know and that that
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically could happen again for
 
02:52:51.309 --> 02:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
very uh ostensibly good purposes but um
 
02:52:53.269 --> 02:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
that is a way that fraud could be
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
introduced and
 
02:52:58.590 --> 02:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
therefore um more easily introduced and
 
02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
therefore we should do things to
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
mitigate the potential of it occurring
 
02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
and so with that in mind I think it's
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's important that we we do clarify
 
02:53:10.910 --> 02:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
that now
 
02:53:14.229 --> 02:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
um representative C has some uh some
 
02:53:16.830 --> 02:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
ideas here for to share with us I
 
02:53:18.229 --> 02:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
understand representative Burnham has to
 
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
leave thank you very much um if you have
 
02:53:24.269 --> 02:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
any further suggestions um or uh
 
02:53:24.279 --> 02:53:25.229 align:start position:0%
any further suggestions um or uh
possible

02:53:25.229 --> 02:53:25.239 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
amendments um to this
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
please um let us know and we will be I
 
02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if you caught this early on
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:38.389 align:start position:0%
we will be
meeting

02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
um uh Tuesday morning at
 
02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
9 um the the only problem I see is we um
 
02:53:51.229 --> 02:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
we may not be meeting here so we'll
 
02:53:54.030 --> 02:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out where we're meeting um
 
02:53:57.469 --> 02:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
who knows the closet over here yeah yeah
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
quite possibly but um and then um I I
 
02:54:04.269 --> 02:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
will see if I can get a more
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
Fuller report out uh this
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
weekend um or on Monday and we'll try
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
and review it um you know if I am able
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
to do this by
 
02:54:21.790 --> 02:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know sometime over the weekend I
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
I really encourage people to get
 
02:54:26.349 --> 02:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
comments back to me you know offline so
 
02:54:28.990 --> 02:54:29.000 align:start position:0%

02:54:32.349 --> 02:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
as complete a report as we possibly can
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
on our Tuesday meeting uh with
 
02:54:39.950 --> 02:54:39.960 align:start position:0%

report together it kind of really helped
 
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
narrow the issues and put them in order
 
02:54:53.550 --> 02:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
so it's uh for the no I it's tough
 
02:54:56.110 --> 02:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
there's it's sometimes things web
 
02:54:57.550 --> 02:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
together and I'm I'm very thankful that
 
02:54:59.510 --> 02:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
you did that so thank you for giving
 
02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
that information like that I I hope I I
 
02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Burnham I do
 
02:55:06.590 --> 02:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
hope that the subcommittee finds it
 
02:55:08.349 --> 02:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
useful I've tried to
 
02:55:08.359 --> 02:55:11.790 align:start position:0%
useful I've tried to
really

02:55:11.790 --> 02:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh analyze and synthesize the issues
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
into as concise a document as possible
 
02:55:22.349 --> 02:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
and um while I may have failed with some
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
of my problem statements and
 
02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
solutions um um it's always easier to
 
02:55:32.269 --> 02:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
edit than it is to do the initial draft
 
02:55:34.830 --> 02:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
but and so I do thank you I it it gave
 
02:55:37.870 --> 02:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
us a good place to start kind of coaling
 
02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I I I do appreciate that I do
 
02:55:42.510 --> 02:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
think these are the I think the four
 
02:55:44.590 --> 02:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
issues that we're wrestling with uh by
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and large there may be other nuances but
 
02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
um anyway I want I do want to again
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative bam thank you um
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative C you have some thoughts
 
02:55:57.070 --> 02:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
on the chain of custody for absentee
 
02:55:59.389 --> 02:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
ballots would you please uh discuss that
 
02:56:01.110 --> 02:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
or introduce that to us and discuss it
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
please okay um this is uh not as it's in
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
current rsas this is what I was trying
 
02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
to um piece together and then putting in
 
02:56:18.830 --> 02:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
what I thought was the use of a
 
02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
notary um and you can see where it's in
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
there but
 
02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
basically when the um clerk mails out a
 
02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh absentee ballot
 
02:56:34.349 --> 02:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
package at that point it's it's in the
 
02:56:36.750 --> 02:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
post office or whatever Delivery Agent
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
is in is using it um there's no real
 
02:56:45.190 --> 02:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
chain of custody on that uh when the
 
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
voter receives the ballot package if
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
they then then go to a notary
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
public then you can say that the chain
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
of custody
 
02:57:00.229 --> 02:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
resumes uh because when the uh voter is
 
02:57:02.309 --> 02:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
with the notary public the notary public
 
02:57:05.950 --> 02:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
can uh verify the person's
 
02:57:10.429 --> 02:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
identification and that the ballot is
 
02:57:12.830 --> 02:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
blank they haven't they aren't haven't
 
02:57:15.269 --> 02:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
been given a previously marked Ballot or
 
02:57:18.229 --> 02:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
anything like that and also the I would
 
02:57:22.110 --> 02:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
think the um notor should at least
 
02:57:24.750 --> 02:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to uh confirm that the ballot is
 
02:57:27.070 --> 02:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
the correct ballot for that person they
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
obviously aren't going to be able to
 
02:57:32.309 --> 02:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
prove it but you know if I asked for one
 
02:57:34.429 --> 02:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
does it say the town of Lowden does it
 
02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
say the know
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh March 11th
 
02:57:47.790 --> 02:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh Town election or whatever it is uh
 
02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:49.030 align:start position:0%
uh uh Town election or whatever it is uh
but

02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
and then while the voter is there but
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
not where the um notary can see them
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
actually Mark the ballot they should
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
Mark the ballot refold it put it in the
 
02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:01.950 align:start position:0%
Mark the ballot refold it put it in the
inner

02:58:01.950 --> 02:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
inner
 
02:58:06.349 --> 02:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
envelope and then the uh notary can then
 
02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
verify all the uh information on the
 
02:58:12.950 --> 02:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
affidavit and put the notary seal on it
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that um provides a u a chain of
 
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
custody with a notary seal because when
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
it gets back to the town and to the U
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
moderator when he or she is ready to
 
02:58:33.229 --> 02:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
process the ballot they can check to see
 
02:58:35.110 --> 02:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
that the envelope is still sealed the
 
02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
notary uh certificate is all filled out
 
02:58:41.150 --> 02:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
and they know that the um person has
 
02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:42.229 align:start position:0%
and they know that the um person has
been

02:58:42.229 --> 02:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
identified and that there is a uh ballot
 
02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
inside the envelope
 
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's the chain I was
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
looking at and I noted up there uh the
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
notary public or other recognized legal
 
02:58:58.910 --> 02:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and I jotted down some
 
02:59:01.070 --> 02:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
possible legal Witnesses
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
below uh obviously we just talked about
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrators U um also uh
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
long-term for somebody who's a long-term
 
02:59:15.710 --> 02:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
hospitalization some Hospital uh
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
administrator we haven't uh um
 
02:59:21.469 --> 02:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
identified how to handle uh people who
 
02:59:21.479 --> 02:59:23.150 align:start position:0%
identified how to handle uh people who
are

02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
homebound but so that list can be added
 
02:59:31.030 --> 02:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
to and probably needs to be codified to
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
legitimate but that was just my thoughts
 
02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
on trying to keep track of the um chain
 
02:59:40.590 --> 02:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
of custody on on the ballots the all the
 
02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
regular ballots there is the chain of
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
custody process already uh prescribed in
 
02:59:47.469 --> 02:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
rsas whether it's what we think it ought
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
to be or not
 
02:59:51.150 --> 02:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
that's you know it may they may need
 
02:59:53.469 --> 02:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
adjustment too but I didn't try to
 
02:59:56.269 --> 02:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
adjust uh uh address that in this
 
02:59:56.279 --> 03:00:01.349 align:start position:0%
adjust uh uh address that in this
particular

03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
statement thank you representative see I
 
03:00:05.790 --> 03:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
think that's very helpful um I think
 
03:00:09.630 --> 03:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
of uh I think this is a good process as
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
you've outlined and I think the
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
identification of a of a starting group
 
03:00:23.110 --> 03:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
of legal Witnesses is very helpful as
 
03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:25.110 align:start position:0%
of legal Witnesses is very helpful as
well

03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:00:26.830 --> 03:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:00:30.550 --> 03:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
I yes I think I oh yeah I put for
 
03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
somebody out of the country um I don't
 
03:00:40.190 --> 03:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
know whether uh embassies or um other um
 
03:00:46.110 --> 03:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
um state secret U uh State Department
 
03:00:50.229 --> 03:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
functions um have notary publics or what
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
they call them or whether it be the
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
charge head to Affairs or the Ambassador
 
03:00:56.910 --> 03:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
himself or yeah who knows I know they
 
03:00:59.550 --> 03:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
have a they don't call them notaries but
 
03:00:59.560 --> 03:01:00.229 align:start position:0%
have a they don't call them notaries but
I

03:01:00.229 --> 03:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
know that there there is a term and I
 
03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:03.389 align:start position:0%
know that there there is a term and I
can't

03:01:03.389 --> 03:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
can't
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
remember right yeah and maybe that's
 
03:01:09.229 --> 03:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
wording we could use someone who
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh capable of administering an oath
 
03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
might be another is another term that we
 
03:01:22.070 --> 03:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
could use to capture people that that
 
03:01:24.269 --> 03:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
can serve as witnesses to the yeah
 
03:01:25.950 --> 03:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we want to list
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
limit it to State Department staff right
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
um because I know like where my kids
 
03:01:34.269 --> 03:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
went to school in Scotland the nearest
 
03:01:37.070 --> 03:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
consulate was over three hours away
 
03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
right so that could be
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
problematic from an access point but I'm
 
03:01:43.870 --> 03:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
sure that they would have some other
 
03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
person to administer
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
Oaths is that something think we can ask
 
03:01:52.190 --> 03:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:56.150 --> 03:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
researcher to find out so if you want to
 
03:01:59.030 --> 03:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
phrase the question representative lane
 
03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
phrase the question representative lane
or

03:02:00.950 --> 03:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:02:03.429 --> 03:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative I think we we want to
 
03:02:07.990 --> 03:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
know what how to express the fact that
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
the equivalent of a a notary or an
 
03:02:14.349 --> 03:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
official witness is in another country
 
03:02:17.550 --> 03:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't if it's uh somebody in the
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
state Department maybe want to maybe
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
include them but are there other terms
 
03:02:25.790 --> 03:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at rather than
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
just a charge a affair or um amb you
 
03:02:30.830 --> 03:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to have to be be
 
03:02:32.469 --> 03:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
the ambassador but you know I mean
 
03:03:08.229 --> 03:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes you said it much better than I did
 
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so um I will send a
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
request to Chairman Barry and and he
 
03:03:20.070 --> 03:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
will forward it to you I'll I'll copy
 
03:03:23.229 --> 03:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
you on the original request but
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
um uh it will be directed to Chairman
 
03:03:28.349 --> 03:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
Barry and he'll approve
 
03:03:28.359 --> 03:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
Barry and he'll approve
it

03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and I again I think even if it's um
 
03:03:38.790 --> 03:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
completed after the uh subcommittee
 
03:03:40.670 --> 03:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
report is done I think it still can be
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
included as evidence and and that would
 
03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:43.870 align:start position:0%
included as evidence and and that would
be

03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:03:46.510 --> 03:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
helpful um because I
 
03:03:50.110 --> 03:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
think we we do want to try and uh take
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
into account as as much of this as
 
03:03:53.279 --> 03:03:54.870 align:start position:0%
into account as as much of this as
possible

03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:03:56.590 --> 03:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
um all
 
03:03:58.429 --> 03:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much
 
03:03:58.439 --> 03:04:00.190 align:start position:0%
right well thank you very much
representative

03:04:00.190 --> 03:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:04:04.229 --> 03:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
c a quick question um with the notary
 
03:04:07.110 --> 03:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
seal a lot of those but not all are
 
03:04:11.150 --> 03:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
raised and would that on it the ballot
 
03:04:12.429 --> 03:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
itself because if it's going through the
 
03:04:13.710 --> 03:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
envelope and everything it's going to
 
03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
catch top and bottom and hit the
 
03:04:18.150 --> 03:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
intermediate ballot is that that would
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
that create problems for the voting
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
machines um perhaps we
 
03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:26.790 align:start position:0%
machines um perhaps we
could

03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
um have a statement if if embossing if
 
03:04:32.429 --> 03:04:32.439 align:start position:0%
notarizing the
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
envelope uses an emboss seal that the
 
03:04:39.070 --> 03:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
embossing should be
 
03:04:42.790 --> 03:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
done um on the flat or prior to on the
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
flap prior to ceiling or something like
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
that prior to including the envelope so
 
03:04:48.429 --> 03:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
as not to damage
 
03:04:50.110 --> 03:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
prior to including the ballot so it's
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
not too we can we can work on that down
 
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
the road something like that but yeah I
 
03:04:54.640 --> 03:04:56.389 align:start position:0%
the road something like that but yeah I
think

03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's we should we should include some
 
03:05:01.229 --> 03:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
provision for that probably my initial
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
thought on that was maybe to have the
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
envelope have a large
 
03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
flap a fullsize flap that could be uh
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
notary seal on and then and then the gum
 
03:05:15.950 --> 03:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
seal on it
 
03:05:19.389 --> 03:05:19.399 align:start position:0%
yeah good as long as it's considered
 
03:05:20.910 --> 03:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I appreciate your
 
03:05:23.190 --> 03:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that and and sort of having
 
03:05:24.990 --> 03:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
this list is very helpful in kind of
 
03:05:28.469 --> 03:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
seeing the process and I I like it a lot
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't and I know this was a
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
concern of yours during uh committee
 
03:05:34.429 --> 03:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
testimonies not to have
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
duplicative identification process
 
03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
through the process um and I I greatly
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
thanks all
 
03:05:48.550 --> 03:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
right I think um
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
just this discussion points
 
03:05:53.870 --> 03:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
paper I I think the only thing is that
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
needs I think I I need to do some
 
03:05:58.590 --> 03:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
serious work on page one based upon the
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
testimony from representative Lynn who
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh as everyone should know was a former
 
03:06:08.590 --> 03:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court justice so
 
03:06:11.550 --> 03:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
and chief justice and chief justice so
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
um he does not come uh he is certainly
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
much more qualified to talk about legal
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
aspects than than uh
 
03:06:22.269 --> 03:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
myself and so I really respect his
 
03:06:24.790 --> 03:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
opinion and was very glad that he could
 
03:06:26.349 --> 03:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
stop by this
 
03:06:26.359 --> 03:06:33.429 align:start position:0%
stop by this
morning

03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:33.439 --> 03:06:35.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:38.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:06:38.110 --> 03:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
um what I I'd like to do is put together
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
a um a more Fuller narrative
 
03:06:51.790 --> 03:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
supporting these discussion points as
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
well I think I can do that over the
 
03:06:59.550 --> 03:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
weekend I I hope um and then uh give
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
that to you know revise this based upon
 
03:07:06.429 --> 03:07:06.439 align:start position:0%
comments and then uh give that to
 
03:07:09.630 --> 03:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
everyone for review and then hopefully I
 
03:07:12.070 --> 03:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
would say late Sunday night that would
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
give the subcommittee Monday to review
 
03:07:18.190 --> 03:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
and then I could make any revision
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
and then we could discuss the completed
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
report Tuesday morning so you think the
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
report going to be something do you let
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
me let me ask you if I had a narrative
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
sort of and then this was one of the
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
attachments you know we I would talk
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
about these at a high
 
03:07:40.030 --> 03:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
level and then include something like
 
03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
this as an attachment that would discuss
 
03:07:47.950 --> 03:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure yeah okay I'm not sure
 
03:07:53.590 --> 03:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
either quite frankly but I um you're in
 
03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
charge but I well I'm I do you
 
03:08:01.150 --> 03:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm an engineer and I find that kind
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
of breaking this down helps me to
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
understand it not that I get every point
 
03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
right but um but then it's easier for
 
03:08:11.229 --> 03:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
people to point out where I'm wrong
 
03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
actually because you know it's been
 
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
identified so I think from
 
03:08:22.830 --> 03:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh that aspect I you
 
03:08:27.630 --> 03:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh I I I do think it helps uh to some
 
03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
degree and
 
03:08:32.429 --> 03:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
then so that's the report aspect and
 
03:08:36.429 --> 03:08:36.439 align:start position:0%
then do we go back and and say give them
 
03:08:38.910 --> 03:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
a um a recommendation for each of the
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
bills that we have or you know like you
 
03:08:43.200 --> 03:08:44.670 align:start position:0%
bills that we have or you know like you
know

03:08:44.670 --> 03:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm fairly certain that most of the
 
03:08:49.469 --> 03:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
Republicans will not be voting for my
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill that that is quite possible 385 I I
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
bet a lot of money on that one uh but I
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
do have an amendment and I do have you
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
know something so I don't know if
 
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
there's other amendments to these that
 
03:09:06.229 --> 03:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to expect and they want we
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
want to fix or do we want to ask people
 
03:09:15.150 --> 03:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
to retain them or um has that's a I'm
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
just saying it's a lot of work to get
 
03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:19.309 align:start position:0%
just saying it's a lot of work to get
done

03:09:19.309 --> 03:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:09:22.190 --> 03:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
right but if somebody if you if you want
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
to tackle that unfortunately I think
 
03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
you're on three different bills you have
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
one or two yeah I only one um yeah but
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's the longest one
 
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
um do you uh so I I will I'll reach out
 
03:09:38.990 --> 03:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
to representative Burnham but I would
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
say if if you have recommendations for
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
bills or Andor amendments you would like
 
03:09:49.950 --> 03:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
like to make if you could make those to
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
me by you know Noonday
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
Sunday and then what I will do is I will
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
consolidate all the input
 
03:10:04.319 --> 03:10:06.030 align:start position:0%
consolidate all the input
and

03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:08.590 --> 03:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh go from
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
there and and you know try in include
 
03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
that in the report as much as possible
 
03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:20.429 align:start position:0%
that in the report as much as possible
um

03:10:20.429 --> 03:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:20.439 --> 03:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:31.030 --> 03:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I I do think it will help us because
 
03:10:33.630 --> 03:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
if if there are some um I'll use the
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
term euphemistically bad bills we could
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
be able to identify them and and as
 
03:10:43.590 --> 03:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
possible amend them prior to
 
03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:45.429 align:start position:0%
possible amend them prior to
Tuesday

03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
03:10:47.950 --> 03:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
um and likewise if there are some that
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
are bad bills that cannot be amended we
 
03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:52.710 align:start position:0%
are bad bills that cannot be amended we
can

03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:10:55.710 --> 03:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh propose an itl out of the
 
03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for you know the full
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee or if there is something that
 
03:11:04.269 --> 03:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
we think yes this has possibilities but
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
we need more time to work on it
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
um you know and I I think we could have
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
fur you know additional recommendations
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
for things to do um and there's always
 
03:11:18.830 --> 03:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
next year but I think
 
03:11:22.269 --> 03:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
um because I I think I think there's I
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
think also one of the things they asked
 
03:11:26.670 --> 03:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
us to do is to see if there if there was
 
03:11:28.389 --> 03:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
something we could combine so it might
 
03:11:30.630 --> 03:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
be that we work on one but the other two
 
03:11:33.389 --> 03:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
that are on the same subject right so I
 
03:11:35.309 --> 03:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
could see that I think yeah there's two
 
03:11:38.670 --> 03:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
or three that are on on one one yeah we
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
we could we could in fact it might be a
 
03:11:42.630 --> 03:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
03:11:45.870 --> 03:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
to consolidate and then retain the other
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
two for example that way that would give
 
03:11:52.110 --> 03:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
us options um that's another possibility
 
03:11:55.790 --> 03:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
um but I think yeah I think that's good
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
so um lots to think
 
03:11:59.040 --> 03:12:09.550 align:start position:0%
so um lots to think
about

03:12:09.550 --> 03:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
um anyway all right um I will go around
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
the room at this point so we're getting
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you all for your Indulgence
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're a few minutes over um but um let's
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
go around the room and I'll take any
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
final comments representative
 
03:12:31.150 --> 03:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
Nome um I think today was a very
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
productive day um at least it felt that
 
03:12:36.510 --> 03:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
way uh more so than uh it's always nice
 
03:12:38.630 --> 03:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
to kind of move the thoughts and bills
 
03:12:42.510 --> 03:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
and Concepts forward um instead of just
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
a day of getting information in that the
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
real synthesis of that was very helpful
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
and uh I think really moved the ball
 
03:12:50.550 --> 03:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
forward quite a bit today and I
 
03:12:53.070 --> 03:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone's efforts thank
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative c um just
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
to re reiterate I think we did get some
 
03:13:03.910 --> 03:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
organization here it I find it helpful
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
to have stuff on paper uh your four-page
 
03:13:10.030 --> 03:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
list was very helpful in starting to
 
03:13:13.710 --> 03:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
focus our uh attention on on the
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
particular aspects that that really need
 
03:13:18.590 --> 03:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
formalized thank you representative Lane
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
I would just Echo uh both represent
 
03:13:27.910 --> 03:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nome and representative
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
C's comments I don't have anything to
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
add very good um I uh thank you I'm I I
 
03:13:40.630 --> 03:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
do want to really help people focus in
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the issues so I'm glad that this has
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
been fruitful I I will just reiterate
 
03:13:49.389 --> 03:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
that um I think some of my thinking
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
might may have been an error because
 
03:13:56.429 --> 03:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh um there are certain aspects of the
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
national voter rights act that had been
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
referenced in other court cases and I
 
03:14:03.990 --> 03:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
thought they could possibly extend but
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
as as representative Lynn former Chief
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
Justice clarified for us that that the
 
03:14:15.309 --> 03:14:15.319 align:start position:0%
ACT is fully excludable to New Hampshire
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
because we still have maintained
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
that uh election day registration aspect
 
03:14:26.309 --> 03:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
we haven't ever stopped it like Maine
 
03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
did and then had to comply with both
 
03:14:32.590 --> 03:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
aspects which um they clearly Maine did
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
not think that through
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
thoroughly um
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
and uh so I I think there's a lot of
 
03:14:42.550 --> 03:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
rework that I have to do on page one
 
03:14:48.429 --> 03:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
because the premises is um
 
03:14:51.950 --> 03:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
is the problem statement is incorrect
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
um and so that that one aspect is not
 
03:14:58.750 --> 03:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
something that we have to necessarily
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
comply and
 
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:09.429 --> 03:15:09.439 align:start position:0%
where I think it's in Crawford versus
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
Maran but you know this the federal
 
03:15:14.349 --> 03:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
government does have to defer to the
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
states for control of Elections and so
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that is something to consider so I
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
just bear in mind that page one will
 
03:15:28.189 --> 03:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
certainly need a lot of
 
03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
revision um I want to thank everybody
 
03:15:32.750 --> 03:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
today for their contributions a lot of
 
03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
thoughtful statements a lot of good um
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
analysis and
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
critiques of of everything was provided
 
03:15:46.269 --> 03:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been good um really
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the four meetings that we've
 
03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
had so far hopefully uh we can do a wrap
 
03:15:55.349 --> 03:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
up on Tuesday morning and
 
03:15:58.469 --> 03:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of time or maybe not so
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
much time between now and then but we'll
 
03:16:03.469 --> 03:16:03.479 align:start position:0%
see what we can do um again I think I'm
 
03:16:05.630 --> 03:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
sort of looking at maybe
 
03:16:11.229 --> 03:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
a 10 to 12 page Report
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
with maybe this as an attachment or
 
03:16:18.309 --> 03:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
embedded Within that these may become
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
like figure ones if they're inside the
 
03:16:22.750 --> 03:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
report or addendums if they're outside
 
03:16:25.150 --> 03:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
the report we would also
 
03:16:29.830 --> 03:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
include uh you know Mr Allen's uh memos
 
03:16:35.110 --> 03:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
as well as the written testimony from Mr
 
03:16:38.110 --> 03:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
Richard um and he is by the way he is we
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
gonna include all that no no we're not
 
03:16:42.189 --> 03:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
going to include all the exhibit so we
 
03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
we will make those available but not as
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
part of the report but I do want to I do
 
03:16:50.590 --> 03:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
want to include his 14-page testimony as
 
03:16:53.349 --> 03:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
part of the report so um because I think
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
it was it was
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
very his explanations were extremely
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
helpful and I think actually added on to
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State statements about
 
03:17:07.309 --> 03:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
the gaps in the absentee ballot his te
 
03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Richard's testimony really helped me
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
think about that aspect much more
 
03:17:14.590 --> 03:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
clearly and I
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
think um helped me understand the
 
03:17:20.830 --> 03:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
affidavit um situation better and so I
 
03:17:23.990 --> 03:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's helpful if
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
we include that but not all the exhibits
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
but make the exhibits available as part
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:37.950 --> 03:17:37.960 align:start position:0%

before but I'll say it again if we have
 
03:17:49.710 --> 03:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd just like to get in the
