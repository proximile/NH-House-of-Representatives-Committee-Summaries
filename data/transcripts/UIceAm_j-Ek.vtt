and i'm going to
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh now that i've called this meeting to
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
order my first order of business
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
discuss what otherwise might become the
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
element in the room if i don't mention
 
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.629 align:start position:0%
element in the room if i don't mention
it

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
those of you who know me will detect
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
that i have a frog in my throat

i do have a cold
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%

and four negative coveted tests in the
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
past week
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
i will be wearing a mask when i'm not
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
talking in front of the microphone
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
i will not wear a mask when i'm talking
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
here i will not wear a mask
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
if you need to approach me to discuss
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
something please give me a second to put
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
my mask on before you get too close
 
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.550 align:start position:0%
my mask on before you get too close
i'm

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm

okay
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
so with that uh
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
out of the way
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
let's uh
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
begin our meeting by all rising for the
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
pledge of allegiance
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
led by the doyen of our committee
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
the first uh item on the agenda is a
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
quick presentation
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
live stream
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
situation here in the room and all the
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
equipment in the room i've asked kristen
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
grant our committee researcher to give
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
us a quick
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh one or two minute overview of the
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
live streaming session you'll notice
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
that there are microphones there are
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
speakers and there are cameras in this
 
00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:32.470 align:start position:0%
speakers and there are cameras in this
room

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
and kristin will give us a quick
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
overview and then you can ask christian
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any
 
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.389 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any
so

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay as soon as
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
first of all as uh chairman bose
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned the stream has started we
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything to make that
 
00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:09.509 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything to make that
happen

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
the guys you know i'm by myself i can do
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.749 align:start position:0%
this um
the

00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
team up in
 
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.590 align:start position:0%
team up in
media

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
media
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
they're starting the stream remotely and
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
they're going to start it you know
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
whenever the meeting is supposed to
 
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.310 align:start position:0%
whenever the meeting is supposed to
convene

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
convene
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
they'll hopefully handle it if we know
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
of a problem i'll try to let them know
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
um if you decide to caucus i'll try to
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
let them know so they can cut the feed
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
because nobody needs to watch that
 
00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.350 align:start position:0%
because nobody needs to watch that
they

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a service that we're
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
providing if the feed goes down the
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
meeting can continue
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's no need to stop it um
 
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.790 align:start position:0%
there's no need to stop it um
the

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise there's it's really just
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
because people can still come into the
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
room so that's basically what we're
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
being told it's just it's
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's a service so if
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
it crashes
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but it's not going to
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
cause us any
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
the microphones are not only to get the
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
feed to the stream
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
audio feed to the stream but also for
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
amplification because of the um
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
what we call the r2d2s that are cleaning
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
the air make it hard to hear anybody's
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
and if we're speaking with masks on
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's even more of a potential issue
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
the microphones are set or should be set
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
i asked them last night
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
to allow up to four
 
00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:41.669 align:start position:0%
to allow up to four
people

00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:43.710 align:start position:0%
to be live at once
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.270 align:start position:0%
to be live at once
[Music]

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean
 
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.230 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean
if

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
four

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
people try to turn on their mics
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
they should be i'll be allowed to speak
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
but if a fifth person turns on their mic
 
00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
but if a fifth person turns on their mic
their

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
light will be a blinking green
 
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.909 align:start position:0%
light will be a blinking green
and

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
they will be next in the queue but they
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
won't be amplified until somebody turns
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
off their mic
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
so it's critical for amplification
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
and for the feed that when you're done
 
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.150 align:start position:0%
and for the feed that when you're done
speaking

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
you push the button and turn off your
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
mic so
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's been sort of um
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's like when we were remote when you
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
were remote i wasn't here yet when one
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
was remote and you wanted to be on mute
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
all the time so that the random sounds
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
of your household didn't come through
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
accidentally same thing here um except
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's only one at a time and chairman
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
votes can mute us all
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the button you have two buttons
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
and you may already know this i'm not
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
sure you have two buttons uh one
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
is obviously the guy talking that's to
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
speak um the other i believe can shut
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
everybody off
 
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.470 align:start position:0%
everybody off
so

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah see if that works
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
um i don't remember what the
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
picture is
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's one with a face
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'll keep talking and we'll see
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
what happens if you can uh can you mute
 
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
what happens if you can uh can you mute
me

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
now i know which one turns you off
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah exactly so that's that's
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
fun thank you yeah
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
so um you'll see it's kind of
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive to me
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
but red means you're all set
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
green means you're not going to be
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
amplified green and blinking means
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
you're next but you're still not going
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be amplified i don't know if anybody
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
wants to like do you want two more
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
people want to turn them on
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
so you mick williams could speak and
 
00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:49.430 align:start position:0%
so you mick williams could speak and
um

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay so representative sansitch would be
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
how many do we have so we have four here
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
and now
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative plett turned his off so
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
now you're live representative sausage
 
00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
now you're live representative sausage
so

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
when it's red we're live is that when
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's red you're live
 
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
and uh representative votes you asked
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
about the sensitivity and i'm not sure
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
how to exactly measure that but
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh john upstairs said
 
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.909 align:start position:0%
uh john upstairs said
um

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much just
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
assume that people can hear you
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know when you're talking um but also
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
be as close as necessary um so basically
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
turn off your mic if
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
you don't want people to hear what
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
could you go over um to turn it off
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
again absolutely
 
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.470 align:start position:0%
again absolutely
sorry

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
i did it to demonstrate but i didn't say
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
what i was doing
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
if it's white it's off correct
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
yep so push the same button to turn it
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
on and to turn it off yep
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay kristin am i also detecting that
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
there is a speaker built into the base
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
of this microphone i think so
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
and you're also hearing
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
well these monitors are pointing this
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
way but yes there's can you hear
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
yourselves because i'm right next to the
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
monitor so i can't tell where i'm
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
hearing this from but are you hearing
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
yourself and me
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
from in front of you
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
that must be yeah i think that's what
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is yeah
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry okay well kristen thank you
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
a better uh uh overview than i was
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%

our members gets a text from one of
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
their constituents and the text says
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
i can't hear the live stream or i can't

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
so the next item on my agenda was just a
 
00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:57.669 align:start position:0%
so the next item on my agenda was just a
quick

00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
discussion of
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
microphone etiquette
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
and what i wanted to remind everybody
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
was that when you're speaking
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
and then you finish speaking you should
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
turn your microphone off
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
if you don't get in the habit of doing
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
that one of these days you're going to
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
forget to turn it off and then you're
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to say something
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
you don't want the rest of the world to
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
hear so
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
try to get in the habit of turning your
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
micro microphone off as soon as you're
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
done speaking
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
and of course the other part of that is
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
be extremely careful that
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
whatever you say
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
might be picked up by the live streaming
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh equipment in this room so
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
if it's not something you want repeated
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
if it's not something you want to see in
 
00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:47.029 align:start position:0%
if it's not something you want to see in
print

00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
print
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
be careful
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have very good attendance so
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
far this morning which is a bit
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
disappointing but
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh it is an extremely cold day and and
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
travel is probably a little difficult
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
for some people
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
but what i would like to do next since
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since we've gotten
 
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.990 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since we've gotten
together

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the same room
 
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:12.570 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.789 align:start position:0%
i would like to
[Music]

00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
initiate committee reintroductions so
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go around the room and have

next item on my agenda is a just a quick
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh outline of what today's agenda is
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have five public hearings today
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
two this morning and we'll take a lunch
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
break at around 11 30ish whenever the
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
second public hearing finishes
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
and then at one o'clock we have another
 
00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:49.830 align:start position:0%
and then at one o'clock we have another
one

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
one two and three so we'll have three
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon that's a total of five
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
public hearings today
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
four of those bills the last four
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
are all early bills meaning that they
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
have to be done by the 17th of february
 
00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:07.590 align:start position:0%
have to be done by the 17th of february
so

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we're hearing
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
them today to get those public hearings
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
done so that
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be in a position to pass judgment
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
on those bills
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later there is a
 
00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:20.310 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later there is a
fifth

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
fifth
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
early bill that the committee needs to
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
hear and it will be the first bill that
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
we hear
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
there will be no executive sessions
 
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.789 align:start position:0%
there will be no executive sessions
today

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:37.909 align:start position:0%
today
so

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
no one has to be concerned
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
about a lack of attendance uh at our
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
now going forward
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
i've already scheduled
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
although most of you probably haven't
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
seen it yet because i don't think carrie
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
morris our committee admin has published
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
the schedule yet i've already scheduled
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
the remaining bills
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
we will have
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
four additional meetings
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
just like today's
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
where five public hearings are held on
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
each day
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
so the dates are
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
the 18th of january the 25th of january
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
and the 8th of february
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
so you will see a notice
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
for each of those sessions from
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
ms morris later today
 
00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:36.070 align:start position:0%
ms morris later today
and

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
i decided to schedule all of those
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
public hearings ahead of time
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
as a courtesy to the bill sponsors so
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
that they could
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
plan for when they have to be here to
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
introduce their bill
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
and also as a courtesy to the members of
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
the committee so that you can all plan
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
your activity
 
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.310 align:start position:0%
your activity
around

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
those public hearings if you need to be
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
out on one of those days for
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
whatever reason at least you'll
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
you'll know
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
when the bill is being heard so you can
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
make arrangements to find out about it
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
if you if you can't be here for the
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
now because we finish our public
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
hearings on february 8th
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to proceed proceed to
 
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.629 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to proceed proceed to
subcommittee

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
meetings and or executive sessions
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
starting on february as early as
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
february 14th
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
you've all noticed that we're in a
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
different room this year than we have
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
been in past years
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
that accommodation was made
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
because the two committees that
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
ordinarily share this room both had a
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
heavy bill load
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
whereas the two committees that share
 
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.190 align:start position:0%
whereas the two committees that share
our

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
our previous room 302 304 had relatively
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
light legislative loads
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
so by swapping
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
one of the heavy load committees with
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
one of the light load committees it'll
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
make scheduling this room easier
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
we share this room with election law
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
i've worked out with representative
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
barbara griffin who is the chair of
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
election law that we can have this room
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
on mondays and
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
tuesdays and election law will have it
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
on wednesday thursday and friday
 
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.630 align:start position:0%
on wednesday thursday and friday
so

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
we could start having either
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or executive session
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
meetings as early as february 14th which
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
would be the monday
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
we won't make a decision about that
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
until after we have our our final public
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
hearings it could either be on monday
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
the 14th or tuesday the 15th
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we have executive sessions on the
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
early bills because they have to be done
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that's our agenda for the next four
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
weeks uh representative callie pitts
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the public can they still uh sign in
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
on their preference on the bill like we
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
have the blue sheets here can they do
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
that remotely
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
in other words if i'm in favor of a bill
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm at home
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
can i still
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
sign in to that bill at home
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative and i do not know the
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
answer i i'm sorry that i don't i can't
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
answer that i think you can do it but i
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
mean yes it's the same process it is
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay same process as last year
 
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
yeah okay same process as last year
apparently

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up would it be possible to
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
just briefly
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
describe that process so anybody
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
listening at home could do that if they
 
00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:48.310 align:start position:0%
listening at home could do that if they
wish

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since i've done it
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
but as i recall
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
you click on a link
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the general court website
 
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
on the general court website
you

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
specify the name of the committee
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
then you
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
spec pick a bill

thank you representative good point
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's the way we've always
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
we've always been able to
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
communicate with the committee via that
 
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.349 align:start position:0%
communicate with the committee via that
method

00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
wow representative mcgee you just made
 
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.190 align:start position:0%
wow representative mcgee you just made
it

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh for being here
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative zamcic can i just
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
inquire about executive sessions um am i
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that there won't be any until
 
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.950 align:start position:0%
assuming that there won't be any until
after

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's likely the case um
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
there may be an extraordinary
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
circumstance that requires us to have
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
one sooner but
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
my plan right now is to wait until after
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
the only reason i'm asking uh right now
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
if for some situations we need a
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
substitute before because they have to
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
come in here in person
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
it would be good to get a heads up on
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.349 align:start position:0%
it would be good to get a heads up on
that

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely agreed
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay before we start our first public
 
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:18.150 align:start position:0%
okay before we start our first public
hearing

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to go over some rules and
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
logistics for the operation of the
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee those of you who want to speak
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
on a given bill at its public hearing
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
must submit a pink
 
00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:32.550 align:start position:0%
must submit a pink
card

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
card
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
such as the one representative plett
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
is holding a loft
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
they are on the back table
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
back there
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
you fill one out and either bring it up
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
to representative pled or pass it up
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
along the table to representative platt
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
you can't speak unless you submit a pink
 
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.069 align:start position:0%
you can't speak unless you submit a pink
card

00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
card
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of people who
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
sign up to speak on a given bill we're
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to limit
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
we're also going to limit questions from
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to two
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
questions per member
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd remind members
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
that we're here to gather information in
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
ask questions
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
do not make speeches
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
you're not here to debate
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
the people testifying you're not here to
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
debate each other
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
we're here to gather information
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
that we can use later
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
to deliberate and make decisions about
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of time for debate in
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
sub-committee meetings and or executive
 
00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:51.270 align:start position:0%
sub-committee meetings and or executive
sessions

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
so be very careful and be very sensitive
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
to the fact
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
that you just need to ask questions and
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
if you can make your questions as
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
succinct and precise as possible you'll
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
probably get a better answer if you ask
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
a long rambling question
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
the answer you get may not
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
be particularly useful so
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
think about that as you put together
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
your your questions
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
so representative mcgee welcome
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
um we had a little committee
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
introduction uh earlier so when you sit
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
down to introduce your bill if you would
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
like you could tell us who you are what
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
district you represent and
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
an optional brief comment about
 
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.790 align:start position:0%
an optional brief comment about
uh

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
your service on the committee
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.390 align:start position:0%
and uh
so

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
at 9
 
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.910 align:start position:0%
at 9
30 34

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
30 34
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it is
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
no it's actually 9 30. that clock is
 
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.150 align:start position:0%
no it's actually 9 30. that clock is
fast

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
fast
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to open the public hearing
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the multi-use energy data
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
flat platform
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
very pleased to
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
have the bill be introduced by a
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
long-time member of this committee
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
the honorable representative kat mcgee
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
take it away thank you mr chairman and
 
00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:18.470 align:start position:0%
take it away thank you mr chairman and
uh

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes my name is uh representative cat
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
mcgee and i'm from hillsborough 27 which
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
is hollis
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
is hollis
uh

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
and i've been on the committee this is
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
my second term
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
and in my first term i had the good
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
fortune to help pass a bill that came to
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
us from the senate for
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
the review of whether the state of new
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire should have an energy
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
data platform that would allow us to be
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
able to see
 
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.990 align:start position:0%
able to see
use

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
and manage our energy data
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
so a bit of an esoteric project but
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
my background is in software engineering
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
program management so it was actually
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's a software project and so
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
i uh i stayed with
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
the project
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
i was invited by the consumer advocate
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
to intervene on the docket at the public
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
utilities commission and so i followed
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
it over there
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
and as the pandemic hit in the first
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
year we went online with our technical
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
sessions and about 34 interveners
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
started working on discussing all of the
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
aspects of the statewide energy data
 
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
aspects of the statewide energy data
platform

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
platform
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
defined in
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
when the bill was passed and signed into
 
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.829 align:start position:0%
when the bill was passed and signed into
law

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
and one of those aspects was privacy and
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
security which was of course a big
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
concern for the utilities
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
they have an obligation
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
consumers energy data
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so the original statute
 
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.190 align:start position:0%
and so the original statute
rsa

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
78 colon 51
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
assigned the determination of the data
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
privacy and security to the public
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
utilities commission process
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
and that bill was signed into law in
 
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.829 align:start position:0%
and that bill was signed into law in
2019

00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
2019
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding went forward
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
with all of the stakeholders including
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
um henceforth in 2020
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
um and we all went forward with a
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
unanimous settlement agreement
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
to the two then commissioners uh this
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
past spring
 
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
past spring
so

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
what happened was
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
when there was a decision to add a
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
department of energy
which

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think is a great idea
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
in hb2 that was written the 80 pages
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
that was delivered to define the
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
the practices of the department of
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
energy along with how it would interact
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
with the public utilities commission
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
it ended up giving
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
that requirement for the data platform
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
but it so the new statute which came
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
under rsa 378-52
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
is now in conflict with the existing
 
00:45:16.319 --> 00:45:17.349 align:start position:0%
is now in conflict with the existing
original

00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
and the efforts to define
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
those technical pieces that's already
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
already occurred
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
at the public utilities commission with
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
so we had all the technical expertise
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
undertook what we were told to do based
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
on the original rsa
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh so this
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a reinvent the wheel
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that was put into language
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
i guess that's that's it
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative
 
00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.230 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative
mcgee

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
does this change
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
apply to rule-making
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
is that why it's necessary to make this
 
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.870 align:start position:0%
is that why it's necessary to make this
change

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
no it's actually it's the technical
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
aspect of
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
determining the standards around how
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
security and privacy will be
 
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.670 align:start position:0%
security and privacy will be
administered

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
administered
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that had to be defined and that was
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they wanted in
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
the original language to make sure that
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
fully vetted
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah it doesn't have anything to do
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
with rulemaking
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the definition
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
exists where
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
if not in rules
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
i think actually the consumer advocate
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
who is here to speak as well may be more
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with that piece than i am i
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't have that in front of me um
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sure um representative
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
knotter you have a question yes thank
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
the question and you said you were for
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
follow up mr
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up
 
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.589 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up
um

00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
you also said it was an addition but
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't it
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
really a combination of other agencies
 
00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:12.309 align:start position:0%
really a combination of other agencies
and

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:14.180 align:start position:0%
departments to create one
 
00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.150 align:start position:0%
departments to create one
[Music]

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand the question
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy was a
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
combination of other
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
agencies to create one rather than
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
several different
 
00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
several different
um

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.549 align:start position:0%
um
groups

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
i think the department of energy is
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
devoted to energy and we had hoped that
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
there would be such an agency
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
to play point on questions around energy
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
policy so that we'd have somebody to
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
consult with
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
um because it's a you know it's a big
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
sector of the economy and i know when
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
the data platform went in and i was
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
trying to help shepherd that i was
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
concerned with the technical piece of
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
the project not being lost because most
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the people that were involved in
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
trying to pass it were non-technical but
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i argued was it
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
has no home
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the state right there's nobody to own
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
it and uh you know if there's going to
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
be a platform
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
that is statewide then somebody at the
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
state needs to understand it and be able
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
to have you know decision making
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
capability on that so um yeah so i had
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned the fact that it would be
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
really nice if we had a department of
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
energy to go to for decisions around
 
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
energy to go to for decisions around
that

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure if i answered your
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
question because i still don't
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying a bunch of
 
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.630 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying a bunch of
agencies

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission is a
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
is a regulatory body that's the
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
distinction really that's made between
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
them and the agencies which fall under
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
when i read through the 80 pages in hb2
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
that defined the department of energy
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things that was
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
told to us when we saw those
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
presentations was there's going to be a
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
bright red line between the regulatory
 
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.630 align:start position:0%
bright red line between the regulatory
agency

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
and you know the
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so i would still maintain that
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're two different animals that it's
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's not really a combination of those
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
two agencies
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's that the public utilities
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
commission budget is now going to come
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
under the department of energy so
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
they'll be administered from within the
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
department of of energy
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't really i don't think it
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
was intended to be a full merging
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
of their duties because they're separate
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr speaker
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh no i'm sorry we're restricting
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
questions to two per member thank you
 
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
questions to two per member thank you
representative

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions for uh
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee representative mick
 
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.589 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee representative mick
williams

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
williams
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um representative
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
mcgee can you just speak a little bit
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
further to
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh the language in this bill that says
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
qualification and registration process
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me who's setting that up
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
how is that administered i think the
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
language before that uh oh thank you for
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
your question representative mick
 
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.670 align:start position:0%
your question representative mick
williams

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
williams
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
um i think the language before that
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
qualifies a third party and
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
15 months of
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had around how
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
this platform would go forward if in
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
fact it's approved after there's an rfp
 
00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:24.710 align:start position:0%
fact it's approved after there's an rfp
um

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
it would likely be outsourced rather
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
than have the technical resources within
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
building it so we would be giving them
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
highly defined um
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
requirements which we we produced during
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
that process together
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
and uh the third party vendor would then
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
prove and vet um the level of standard
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
that we've defined in terms of security
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
and privacy
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the utility data not just the utility
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
data but that's pretty much the prime
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
sources utilities
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sure
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative platt
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
um you are choosing
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
378-522 to uh from the department of
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
energy to commission to resolve a
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
conflict the other way you could have
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
resolved the conflict is to take where
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
the conflict occurs and change that to
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
the department of energy so it's
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
entirely in the department of energy
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
why did you choose the puc rather than
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:34.870 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
well

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
the way i described in the testimony i
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
wrote which i didn't read is that it's a
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
question of reinventing the wheel
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
because the case has already the the
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicative docket
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
right where all of the stakeholders were
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
working towards the answers to the
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
solution you know coming up with
 
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
solution you know coming up with
solutions

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's already been done so the folks at
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
the department of energy don't have the
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
benefit of any of those 15 months worth
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
of discussions with the technical people
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
from the utilities
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
and so the conversations around what has
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is it it took the
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
language from the original statute and
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
just switched it over and said somebody
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
else needs to do it
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
but it didn't take into account the two
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
and a half years in between where
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
somebody was already doing that
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make sense to put it the
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
other way
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
because um the original statute is the
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
one that's already been followed
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't we don't need an exploration
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
for how security and privacy
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
should go forward because the utilities
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
have already
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
provided that information
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee um
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
verify that i heard
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
your presentation correctly you were
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
talking about a need for someone to to
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
own this
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
platform and have a home
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
for the platform
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
do i understand correctly that
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
that ownership and that home would be
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
no is it the department of energy
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
well and your bill here as stated here
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
talks about this
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
secure environment and privacy standards
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
established by the commission so does
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
one agency establish the privacy
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and the other one owns it
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
or the same entity owns it and
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
that gives it a home no thank you for
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
the question uh representative samsich
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i think
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the platform itself if it ends up
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
would likely be under the under the
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
purview of the department of energy i
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that would be where the oversight
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
would come from the definition of
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
getting us to the point where we had
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
requirements to send out for an rfp that
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
was the complicated part was hashing
 
00:54:07.119 --> 00:54:08.069 align:start position:0%
was the complicated part was hashing
through

00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
what are we building what will it do
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
what are the benefits and until we had
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
all of that definition we couldn't
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
really ask somebody to price it because
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's a software project so they have to
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
tell you how much it'll cost to build
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
and um i'll just say this so that you
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
guys can be informed of this because it
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.069 align:start position:0%
guys can be informed of this because it
matters

00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
the utilities agreed with us that the
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
correct architecture for the project was
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
an api of apis and what that means is
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
that there would be a processing unit
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
that would be in between
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
the data that they hold and the data
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
that gets aggregated and goes out to the
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
person who's making a query of the
 
00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.190 align:start position:0%
person who's making a query of the
system

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
so basically it's a very nimble agile
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
system and it's not really expensive to
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
build the architecture that way
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
so we did a lot of the pre-work in order
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
to save the state money there was no
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
cost really to that adjudicative
 
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
cost really to that adjudicative
proceeding

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative proceeding
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
forced all of the stakeholders to come
 
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
together at their own expense
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
and try and get us to
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
the starting point and so what we're
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
saying is that language
 
00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:17.589 align:start position:0%
saying is that language
that

00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
made the charge of figuring out how
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
privacy and security should be done
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
still needs to remain consistent that it
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
was part of the adjudicative proceeding
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
and is not something that the doe has to
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
reinvent now
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
we just don't want it to say cause then
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
because then somebody will feel they
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
have to do something because it's in law
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
right so it's just they're inconsistent
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just one follow-up
 
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.789 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just one follow-up
um

00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
can you again state for us uh what
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually the purpose and the goal is of
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
having a energy data platform sure
 
00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
having a energy data platform sure
um

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody's heard but you
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
know data's kind of king right now
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
and um a lot of the sort of downstream
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
management of energy in the future
 
00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:04.789 align:start position:0%
management of energy in the future
especially

00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
with all the different types of energy
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
sources there are now
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
will be governed by who can see the full
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
picture of what's happening with energy
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
we like to say we have a saying that we
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
would use which is you can't manage what
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
you can't measure
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so the energy data platform is to
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
move the state forward so that we can
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
have that snapshot and be able to
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
aggregate data in a way that makes sense
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
so that we can look at
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
for example community power you know if
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
if folks
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
who are doing something together want to
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
be able to see a picture of what they're
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
doing they can't really get that now
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's very very cumbersome and clunky and
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
go back to the well with the utilities
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
again and again to try and get your own
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
data so we're really just trying to open
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
that up so that
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
the data can be used in order to make
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
improvements and again
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
that doesn't cost anything but it will
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative brezhney
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee for taking my
 
00:57:10.079 --> 00:57:11.270 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee for taking my
question

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill doesn't pass
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
will they be recreating all of the same
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
information and if they do that are they
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
able to reuse
 
00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
what was produced by the commission
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
sure

00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i think the point of the
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
language in the bill which actually came
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
from the consumer advocate
 
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.030 align:start position:0%
from the consumer advocate
um

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
in our discussion that there was an
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in what was in you know
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
what was in statute uh by the passing of
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
as it is right now doesn't have the kind
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
of proceeding that we pursued over at
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
the puc the puc is kind of uniquely
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
set up to have to host these kinds of
 
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.990 align:start position:0%
set up to have to host these kinds of
meetings

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.109 align:start position:0%
meetings
um

00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
in order and we had
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
we had several maybe eight or so
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
eight hour technical sessions
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know and that's just not something
 
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
the doe would likely undertake
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i guess to answer your question
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
if it goes into law this way there will
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
be confusion because the doe will feel
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
as though it has a requirement to do
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
something to achieve this
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
could they use the information that's
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
already been provided
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i can i don't know if i
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
can answer that um i mean it would make
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.390 align:start position:0%
sense to
um

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
but i just think we we're just trying to
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
clear up the confusion in the statute
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
that it's not consistent with itself
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
that there's two existing statues that
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
say two different things and i just
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
wanted you to know the background of the
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
the first statute
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
created a process where we where we
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
responded to what we were told to do
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
so it isn't necessary to say now the doe
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
has to tell us what to do
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't really have to do
 
00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.150 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't really have to do
that

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure they have the
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
the people to do it either because it
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
was they were technical you know
 
00:59:05.839 --> 00:59:07.030 align:start position:0%
was they were technical you know
security

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.549 align:start position:0%
security
considerations

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
i have a question as well
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
we received written testimony that says
 
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.470 align:start position:0%
we received written testimony that says
that

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
on may 5th
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
the parties went before the commission
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
to present a settlement agreement
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
and so far the commission has failed to
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
issue an order in the in the docket
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
does this change affect that settlement
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
agreement does it affect the docket
 
00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:38.549 align:start position:0%
agreement does it affect the docket
what

00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
impact will making this change have on
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
what's going forward as of
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
today uh it shouldn't have any because
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
the new language for the new statute
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
came from hb2
 
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.750 align:start position:0%
came from hb2
and

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
affects the platform which was
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
implemented back in 2019 in terms of
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the adjudicative
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
proceeding so it shouldn't have
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
any effect if we
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
move this in to to clarify the
 
01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:10.950 align:start position:0%
move this in to to clarify the
information

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
it is kind of an issue that the
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
the puc hasn't come up with a decision
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
since cinco de mayo but um which was a
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
very happy day for all of us
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
um never seen such kumbaya
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
with everybody involved
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
however i mean i think there's been a
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
pattern over there of um
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
delay and also you know there's been a
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
bit of upheaval there's been changes in
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
personnel and they haven't had full
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
complement so
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think regardless of what is going on
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
with the public utilities commission and
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.309 align:start position:0%
their decision
the

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
the extent of the
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
the detailed requirements that have been
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
developed we developed user stories
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
which are the more sophisticated level
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
and also had many many discussions with
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
the technical people and security people
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the utilities
 
01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.109 align:start position:0%
of the utilities
so

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:05.829 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
no matter which way it goes at the
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission that work
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
has already been done that's the way i
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
would say it
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
great thank you for clarifying that
 
01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:22.309 align:start position:0%
great thank you for clarifying that
point

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
i was concerned a little bit by this is
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
what we were told to do
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
who and where
 
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
and on this type of security information
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
is this personal information is this
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour is used is this
 
01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:49.109 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour is used is this
because

01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours as i understand it is is
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
reported regularly
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
so is this personal information we're
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh the intent of the
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
data platform is to allow us to
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
aggregate data information so it's not
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
related to the individual customers at
 
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.109 align:start position:0%
related to the individual customers at
all

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's the idea of being able to look at
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
data that you want to see combined
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
basically so no the the personal
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
information that's part of the privacy
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
standards and considerations that we
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
worked through yeah
 
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.589 align:start position:0%
worked through yeah
so

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:24.789 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the people from the
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
utilities who have
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know frontline responsibility for
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
securing that data
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
were the people who contributed the
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
solutions that
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think they they understand you know
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
they understand both what the tool is
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
intended to do with energy data and also
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
the privacy concerns for the individual
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
customer that have to be protected so
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
all of those conversations were what we
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay again i'm going to ask who was
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
who told you to do this
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
and is this data already
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
in fractured form available from other
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
places that is a broad bracelet
 
01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.190 align:start position:0%
places that is a broad bracelet
um

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
is this available again are we going at
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours are we going to you know
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
timer use
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
yeah and all that is is that all
 
01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:30.309 align:start position:0%
yeah and all that is is that all
available

01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:31.750 align:start position:0%
available
in

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
the different utilities
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
and is this an effort to just combine
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
this and put it all together
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's a good question thank you for the
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
question representative kelly cutts
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
who told us to do it was the passing of
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
the bill so the the statute that was
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
passed 378 51 the original statute was
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
who told us what we had to do what we
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
had to satisfy
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so that's who told us to do it the us
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
the the people who
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
joined in as interveners on the docket
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh to engage in the discussions around
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
solving for the things that the law told
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
us we needed to satisfy
 
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.589 align:start position:0%
us we needed to satisfy
um

01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
and so that included all of the
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
utilities and they
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
were very generous in supplying
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
technical resources for those
 
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.789 align:start position:0%
technical resources for those
conversations

01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:22.230 align:start position:0%
conversations
um

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
and as far as where the data is it's
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually we had testimony on that
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
um that there are there are some towns
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
that are more
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
you know aggressive in trying to
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
either convert to cleaner energy sources
 
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
or invest in unique things getting their
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
energy picture means
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
we had testimony actually from
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
from someone who's engaged in that work
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
in hanover i believe
 
01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.430 align:start position:0%
in hanover i believe
and

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
what she said was we pulled together
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
all of our data from the utilities
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
got it in a spreadsheet managed it you
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
know created macros did all these things
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
to to create the picture and then they
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
realized it took them six months to do
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
it and the next time they want to look
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
at it it would take them six months
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
again so
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
it can be done
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
but it
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
in an information age where you can have
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
you know systems do that kind of
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
combinations for you it just doesn't
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
make any sense for us to have no way of
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
getting the data that we're trying to
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
get and so we're trying to really just
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
advance the state's ability to look at
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
what's happening with energy across the
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
state and then you can make better
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
decisions from there because you then
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
have the information that you need
 
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
have the information that you need
available

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:47.349 align:start position:0%
pitts remember to turn off your mic good
questions

01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
all right any more questions for

griffin robarge who will represent the
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
department of energy and he's asked for
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
two minutes he's neutral on this build

01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
um based on conversations with staff
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
within the department it appears this
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
a technical fix
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
um the state statute as the prime
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor already indicated um there was a
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
bill two years ago in 2019 that created
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
this platform
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
that senate bill 284 for everybody's
 
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.470 align:start position:0%
that senate bill 284 for everybody's
reference

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
given that the department was created
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
through the budget trailer bill last
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
year hb2
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
there were a number of changes
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
throughout statute
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
for the department
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
this appears to be
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
something that was changed removed the
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
original commission reference on line
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
six replaced it with the department of
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
energy and the bill is looking to move
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
it back to commission
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
um like i said the department kind of
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
believes this is a technical fix as the
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
puc has already commenced in uh
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
a proceeding on this and for the record
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's d e
 
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
that's d e
19-19-7

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and they've already uh i believe they
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
also have a settlement agreement that
 
01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.670 align:start position:0%
also have a settlement agreement that
was

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
filed with a puc in april of this of
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
last year in 2021
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
containing the section on platform
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
security and privacy standards
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
held a hearing
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
on the settlement agreement on may 5th
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
of last year however it has not
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh there hasn't been an order issued by
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
the puc yet um at this point at this
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
point the establishment of the privacy
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
standards is pending before the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
commission in the form of settlement
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
agreement um i know this seems like a
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
technical fix but i think the department
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
would like to at least take a
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
a quick glance at the whole statute
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
holistically just be sure that there
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
aren't any other changes that need to
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
take place little housekeeping measures
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
separation of the puc in the department
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
in the budget they just want to make
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
sure that they capture all the necessary
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
changes that need to take place
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
with that i'm willing to take any
 
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.550 align:start position:0%
with that i'm willing to take any
questions

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%

the question
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
being the new kid on the block did you
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that the department of energy was a
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
combination of the office of strategic
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
initiatives and the public utilities
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
commission and the idea for that
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
combining came from the governor's
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
office yes i do understand that and just
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
to answer a little bit of your question
 
01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
of the prime sponsor earlier i believe
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
the puc is administratively attached to
 
01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.350 align:start position:0%
the puc is administratively attached to
the

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy but
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't get involved with well obviously
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
participates in various dockets and that
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
type of thing but
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have like a leadership role in
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
the puc or anything like that i should
 
01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.149 align:start position:0%
the puc or anything like that i should
say

01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%

committee and please try to reference
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
the rsa so that we can do our homework
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
that was that was my intention to send
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
question from one of my committee
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
members here
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
who asked
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy could
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
even without this change
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
use that data to make changes that are
 
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
use that data to make changes that are
needed

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
add on to that request to say
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what is the most
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
effective way of making those changes
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's always a work around everything
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
but it might be the efficient way of
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%

01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
implementing this system and
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
would they be knowledgeable about
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
um all of these issues in the bill
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
um like i uh thank you for the question
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative as i mentioned there is
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
an active proceeding before the puc and
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
there are a number of parties involved
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
in that including the puc
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh and the utilities as well
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there might be others to speak
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh after me in terms of where the
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
proceeding currently stands i as i
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know um there's a hearing
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
on the settlement agreement but it has
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
not yet issued and the puc has not yet
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
issued an order um can certainly try to
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
get you
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
a stats update as to you know
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
how that proceeding has been going and
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
provide you a link to the docket as well
 
01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
any additional
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
comments or questions i should say for
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
mr roberge i have a comment
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy deserves
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
congratulations for hiring mr roberge
 
01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
congratulations for hiring mr roberge
because

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
in his previous role as an aide to the
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
senate energy and natural resources
 
01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:33.189 align:start position:0%
senate energy and natural resources
committee

01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
he demonstrated
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
a level of detail that is
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
that was superb and a knowledge of
 
01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.070 align:start position:0%
that was superb and a knowledge of
industry

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
energy matters that was also superb so i
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
think the department of energy did a
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
good job by hiring mr roberts thank you
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%

donald crease i am the consumer advocate
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
by statute my job is to represent the
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
interests of residential utility
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
customers i wrote down what
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts said because
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing applies to me she said
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
you get stuck with me
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
but i kind of know what i'm talking
 
01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
but i kind of know what i'm talking
about

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.790 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
data platform statute originated with a
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
request that i made to senator fuller
 
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.870 align:start position:0%
request that i made to senator fuller
clark

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
clark
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 to introduce a bill to
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
create such a platform and the reason i
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
made that request is and this is
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with what representative
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
mcgee said
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
access to data is really important to
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
consumers and when i say access to data
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
i mean data about their usage of energy
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
that they are able to share with third
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
parties that are unregulated so not
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
utilities that provide consumers with
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
services that allow them to save money
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
and become more active and engaged users
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
of the grid without necessarily spending
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on it themselves the data
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
currently reposes in the back end of the
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
systems that utilities have
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
and what the platform will do is provide
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
a ready source or a ready go-to place
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
for that data and you as a consumer can
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
authorize a third party to access that
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
data and that third party pings the
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
platform gets the data and provides you
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
with services based on the data and i
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
agree with representative mcgee that
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
a key element of providing benefits of
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the transition to competition for
 
01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.550 align:start position:0%
the transition to competition for
uh

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
electric natural gas
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
utility customers
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 uh this bill got to
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
governor sununu for his signature and it
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
was one of only two energy related bills
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that he signed into law and did not veto
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that says something to all
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
of you or should say something to all of
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
you about
 
01:16:23.229 --> 01:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
the importance and the
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
non-controversial nature of this
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
initiative there were questions about
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
ownership of the platform as i
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
originally drafted the bill i was going
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
to propose having the public utilities
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
commission actually operate this
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
platform this was before there was a
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
department of energy so i couldn't
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
suggest having the department of energy
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
but in the preliminary discussions with
 
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.350 align:start position:0%
but in the preliminary discussions with
the

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and with the
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
department of information technology it
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
was suggested to me that it would be
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
better to have this data platform live
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
in the private sector so what we did in
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
the statute is actually task the
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
utilities with developing and operating
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
the platform uh but the idea is that
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to some oversight
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that they don't do that in a
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
self-interested way so the statute told
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
the puc to open an adjudicative
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding it did that and there was a
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
remarkable bit of very intense
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
collaboration and cooperation amongst
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders i went into that
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
process with a great deal of skepticism
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
i came out of that process really
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
excited i heard representative mcgee
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
call it a kumbaya moment it was a it was
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
one of it probably the most successful
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
effort at collaboration i've seen in the
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
what five years that i have been a
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate as a result of that we
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
entered into a
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive settlement agreement
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
we filed it on april 21st of 2021
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
as you heard the commission conducted a
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on may 5th of 2021
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i would say respectfully that the
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement to which there was
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
no opposition has
 
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
no opposition has
languished

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
languished
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
at the puc since then so just yesterday
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
with the agreement i think of all the
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
major parties to the docket i sent the
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
commission a letter requesting an
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
expedited decision and i actually
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
offered to write their order for them
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
i used to write orders for the puc for a
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
living back when i was the general
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
counsel of the puc so i know how to do
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
it and if they need that kind of help
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
because they're very busy and very
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
resource challenged i'd be happy to
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
do that for them i agree with the
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy and mr roberge that
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is a technical fix my perspective
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the bill is that it paves the way for
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh expedited or efficient approval of
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
the settlement agreement by not
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
introducing any confusion into what the
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
process is from getting to where we are
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
to where we need to be so the reason to
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
do the bill is to basically allow that
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
settlement process to continue to go
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
forward the settlement does not
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
automatically lead to the development of
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
the platform what it leads to is the
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
creation of a platform governance
 
01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.229 align:start position:0%
creation of a platform governance
council

01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
that will develop a request for
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
proposals the rfp will go out the
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
responses will come in we'll figure out
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
what this thing will cost and
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's where the rubber will hit the
 
01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
that's where the rubber will hit the
road

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's all i have to say and of
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
course i'd be happy to answer questions
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
illuminating testimony i have a quick
 
01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.790 align:start position:0%
illuminating testimony i have a quick
question

01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
before i open it up to the rest of the
 
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.390 align:start position:0%
before i open it up to the rest of the
committee

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
you stated that there is an open docket
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
about the settlement agreement before
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
the puc it's been open since
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
my question is do you have any
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
assurance that this change isn't going
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
to disrupt what's already seems to be a
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
languishing process and make it worse
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
or will it make it better i think it
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
will make it better by clarifying that
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
the process that led to the settlement
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
agreement and the process in the
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement can go forward and
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
just to correct the chairman slightly
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
the docket the statute which was signed
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
into law on september 17th of 2019 told
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
the puc open and adjudicative proceeding
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
within 90 days and the commission did
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
exactly that it opened the proceeding in
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
december of 2019
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
i take that reference to 90 days to be a
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislative judgment that this should go
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
forward as expeditiously as possible it
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
took a long time because there are a lot
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
of technical issues for the uh various
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to come to agreement but
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
now that they have i'm a little
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
frustrated that it's taking the
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
commission so long
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
to approve the agreement one thing you
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
might not know is that new hampshire has
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
actually been recognized as the national
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
leader when it comes to developing
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
statewide platforms like this our
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
friends in the state next door maine
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually adopted a statute based on ours
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
they told their puc to issue an rfp and
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
that has happened so
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
maine i regret to say has sort of
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
leapfrogged over uh new hampshire and
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
for that reason
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
not only should you pass this bill but
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
you should all write to the puc and say
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
hey puc time to issue an order
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
get dawn to write it
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
mr crease
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
mr greece
 
01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
mr greece
uh

01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
just a clarification for me please
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
are you in favor of the change to
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
commission rather than department of
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
energy because that's what this bill is
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
doing yes i i am in favor of that change
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
the the department of energy is
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in this
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
it morphed from the staff of the puc
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
which was intimately involved and so i
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
have no shortage of faith that the doe
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
the department of energy will be up to
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
its neck in this regardless of uh what
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
that left me kind of like
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
they will be involved but you would
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
rather have the entire process in the
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
hands of the commission because that's
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes and that means that the commission
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
can say settlement approved go forth and
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
issue your rfp
 
01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:24.629 align:start position:0%
issue your rfp
and

01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
the at the back end of the statute the
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
commission gets to determine
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
if the costs of the platform would be
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
unreasonable relative to the benefits
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that authority in the commission
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
isn't changing didn't change as a result
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
of house bill 2 last year so it would
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
clarify that the process the path to
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
that approval by the puc
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
is still
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
clear and as it was originally intended
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt do you have a
 
01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.669 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt do you have a
question

01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes yes assuming this passes
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
do you imagine three or four years from
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
now uh that the responsibility would
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
shift back from the puc to the
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's possible i think you know the
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
platform will get up and running and
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it works and what tweaks
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
need to be made to the way it operates
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the way it's governed and it might
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh in three or four years to re-examine
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
take what hopefully will be a pretty
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
non-controversial little bit of public
 
01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.229 align:start position:0%
non-controversial little bit of public
service

01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
and vest oversight in whichever agency
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um and uh thank
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i apologize
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
for asking this question a little bit
 
01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.709 align:start position:0%
for asking this question a little bit
late

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
late
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
but when your first words uh you you
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
made a statement that opened the door to
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
this question i'm going to ask you
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
when you said that the consumers
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
grant a third party access to their data
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
could you specifically tell me
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by that what type of
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
data do you mean just their total
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour usage in total or are you
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
talking about something that goes into
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
what type of data would the third party
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
have and be able to tell the consumer
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm talking about data in more detail
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the more sophisticated we get in
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the metering that we have our
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
utilities doing the more granular the
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
data becomes and the more uniquely
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
tailored to your needs at your home or
 
01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
tailored to your needs at your home or
business

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the data
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
the services can become
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so yes the answer to your question
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
is yes i'm talking about detailed data
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason that there are
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
very strong privacy protections in the
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
statute because this is new hampshire we
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
are hyper concerned as we should be
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
about privacy so there are protections
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the statute to make sure that that
 
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.270 align:start position:0%
in the statute to make sure that that
you

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
your data
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
will not be shared your individual data
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
unless you grant permission
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
to the platform to specifically share
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
that data with that specific third party
 
01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:13.990 align:start position:0%
that data with that specific third party
provider

01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
provider
follow-up

01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr juror for the follow-up um
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll try not to use up my follow-up
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
question by maybe making a comment and
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
then ask my follow-up question i was
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
looking for something more specific than
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
just yes more detailed uh in terms of
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
maybe uh they
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
so in other words they would be able to
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
tell you um
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
when and what appliance you're using at
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
any one time
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up question would be
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
so therefore if you wanted to contact
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
the third party and say hey i just
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
bought a new
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
hot tub
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
how much
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
electrical power am i going to be using
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
based on make model year wattage and so
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
forth or does the consumer have to his
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
own math form would yield the kind of
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
data that would help some third party
 
01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
data that would help some third party
provider

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
help you you can go about your business
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer or an architect or a farmer
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
without thinking about it all day
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
or if you happen to be all three of
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
those things then all the better
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're picking on me thank you that's
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
mr crease representative callie pitts
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i'm a little foggy this
 
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i'm a little foggy this
morning

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
would a customer be able to access their
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
own data information and not have to go
 
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
own data information and not have to go
through

01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
a third party
 
01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.470 align:start position:0%
a third party
yes

01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and the reason i didn't stress that
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's interesting and maybe informative
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
to you as an into your
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh consumption is but it's even better
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
if you can share that with a third party
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
mr crease just i'll follow on to her
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
comment by pointing out that i'm a
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
customer of new hampshire electric co-op
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
and the co-op offered me an opportunity
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
to buy a small device that i could put
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
into my electrical panel
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
and that device would track
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
the usage for every
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
appliance in the panel
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it provided a phone app that i could
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
use to
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
look at for example how much i'm using
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
my furnace and how much i'm using my
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
pump or whatever and uh it was not too
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
expensive maybe around 250 or so
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
the only thing that prevented me from
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
buying it was that the utility wanted
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
me to share that information with them
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i wasn't
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that at the time so i
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
did not buy it but those devices are
 
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
did not buy it but those devices are
available

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.470 align:start position:0%
available
and

01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
there is a way for customers to see
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what how they're using their
 
01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
exactly what how they're using their
electricity

01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
if i don't just let could i just respond
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
to that briefly before you move on to
 
01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
to that briefly before you move on to
representative

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
the co-op would want me to say that
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're a member of the cooperative not
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
just a customer meaning you own a slice
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the utility yourself along with your
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
fellow customers
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the co the co-op is not
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
part of the data platform collaboration
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
at present it can opt in if it wants to
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that was included in the bill
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh i i i hope to i hope to entice the
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
cooperative to participate in the data
 
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
cooperative to participate in the data
platform

01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh but in the meantime
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the new hampshire electric co-op
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
because it's customer owned
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
has typically led the way in terms of
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
utility innovation and uh if you happen
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
to live in their territory you're lucky
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
as represent as chairman vos's to be a
 
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.629 align:start position:0%
as represent as chairman vos's to be a
member

01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
member
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative platt i just wanted to
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
say i'm not interested in sharing the
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
hot tub because i'm usually on hot water
 
01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.830 align:start position:0%
hot tub because i'm usually on hot water
anyway

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plett remember
 
01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're here to gather information and ask
 
01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
we're here to gather information and ask
questions

01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
not provide too much information
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh uh whoops looks
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
like we have one more question
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for taking my question that's
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
so i really get a good handle we've
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
we've referenced spark meters a couple
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
times here
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh but smart meters are not in wide uses
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
that usage as of yet
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
would a bill such as this the
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
information that you would gather from a
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
smart meter make it even more imperative
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
that we do have
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
certain um
 
01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:31.030 align:start position:0%
certain um
privacy

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.229 align:start position:0%
 
assurances

01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
assurances
 
01:29:32.239 --> 01:29:33.669 align:start position:0%
assurances
enacted

01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think the answer to your question is
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
yes i heard two things one it is true
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
not as fully deployed in smart meters as
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
we ought to be and so we are busy
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
nudging all of our utilities especially
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
a really big one whose name i won't
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
mention but whose initials are
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
eversource to fully implement smart
 
01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.390 align:start position:0%
eversource to fully implement smart
meters

01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
meters
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh but as your your question implies as
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
the meter gets smarter the privacy
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
implications become more profound and
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why that is a reason
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
why we need to be very vigilant about
 
01:30:04.159 --> 01:30:07.990 align:start position:0%
why we need to be very vigilant about
privacy

01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for the consumer
 
01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.669 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for the consumer
advocate

01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will thank the consumer
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for his testimony

hampshire
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
she submitted written testimony so i
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%

01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
oral testimony will be a brief summary
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
of that written testimony yes it will
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%

i am the director of legislative and
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory affairs for clean energy new
 
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.110 align:start position:0%
regulatory affairs for clean energy new
hampshire

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
i did submit
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately kind of lengthy testimony
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
for you today so i will let you read
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
that on your own but um i just wanted to
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
come before you and let you know that we
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
support house bill 1285. we were a party
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
to the settlement agreement in the
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
docket that looked at establishing a
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
process to create this energy data
 
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.149 align:start position:0%
process to create this energy data
platform

01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
platform
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
and what the other uh the previous
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
testimony before me has said is true it
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
was truly a collaborative docket it's
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
probably the best one i've ever been a
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
part of to say the least and um
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
insofar as the commission feels any sort
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
of heartburn regarding this confusion in
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
the statute we would like to see it
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
resolved by using house bill 1285 as a
 
01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.550 align:start position:0%
resolved by using house bill 1285 as a
vehicle

01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:27.830 align:start position:0%
vehicle
and

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
this would ensure or help prevent any
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
sort of further delay with adopting the
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement in this docket
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
which went a great deal further
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
in establishing a consensus agreement on
 
01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.149 align:start position:0%
in establishing a consensus agreement on
really

01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
quite strong privacy and security
 
01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.270 align:start position:0%
quite strong privacy and security
requirements

01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
that the utilities felt comfortable with
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
as well as the advocates
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to answer any of your
 
01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to answer any of your
questions

01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to bring before you a very
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
simplistic example of how the data
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
platform could currently be used are the
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities to utilize the platform
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
are a bit endless frankly but
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
say for example you're a business owner
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
and you're interested in having an
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
energy audit and some weatherization
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
services provided
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
you could contact for example one of our
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
members resilient buildings group here
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
in concord and say
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
oh you know i'm really interested in
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
having you take a look at my building
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
well the first thing they would do much
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
like when you go to the doctor you have
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
your blood drawn and they take a look at
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
how your body is functioning
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
is that brazilian buildings group would
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
go and ask the utilities to access your
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
energy data
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
as a third party service provider that
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
process has been really challenging um
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
it could take several weeks perhaps
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
months to get that data from the
 
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.390 align:start position:0%
months to get that data from the
utilities

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
so this data platform would really
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
resolve a business problem and it would
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier for customers to access
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
what is already theirs
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
so with that i would be happy to answer
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
any of your questions
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony any
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
none i'll thank you for your testimony
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
this morning and i will
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on house bill
 
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.310 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on house bill
1285.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
1285.
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
we'll take a bio break until our next
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.880 --> 01:40:19.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
that they do so in a
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
put together that that study and i'm i'm
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%

but it's the
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
commission to study career pathways from
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
full-time service year programs to
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education and employment
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities in support of new
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire's future workforce needs it
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
might have more words than the number of
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
members of this commission that we're
 
01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:01.750 align:start position:0%
members of this commission that we're
proposing

01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%

01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
have you done the math to see how much
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
each commission costs especially with
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
like 20 people when you add up mileage
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%

01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
system works i tried to turn off
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%

you representative wilhelm
um

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
when i was still a teenager i must say i
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
was very much inspired by president
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
kennedy's peace corps
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
call to young people back then
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
and as we all know
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
huge boom in young people getting
 
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
huge boom in young people getting
involved

01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh making the peace corps a
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
ambassador for the country in other
 
01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.870 align:start position:0%
ambassador for the country in other
countries

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
countries
 
01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:24.629 align:start position:0%
countries
um

01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
however today i got to say
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that many people in this
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
country and i gotta say i was born in a
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
foreign country but many people in this
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
country don't seem to think that they
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
have any obligation to serving their
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
country at all
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
and so i want to ask you represent
 
01:42:42.719 --> 01:42:44.070 align:start position:0%
and so i want to ask you represent
wilhelm

01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
wilhelm
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
because this is kind of i've always felt
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
this way that would you would you agree
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
with me on
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
the need for a concept where national
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
service should be something that
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
everyone does in this country not just
 
01:42:56.639 --> 01:43:00.709 align:start position:0%
everyone does in this country not just
some

01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question
 
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.830 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question
representative

01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not for mandatory national
 
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not for mandatory national
service

01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
but i am for providing
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh incentives
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh to people to stand up raise their
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
hand folks who are inspired for whatever
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
reason uh to serve their community in
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
their country uh which is you know very
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
much what we were looking at with the
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
commission uh that wrapped up its work
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
last year and
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh if i might
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
i will say that uh the reason that i
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
joined americorps to serve as a civilian
 
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:37.570 align:start position:0%
national service member
 
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:38.629 align:start position:0%
national service member
[Music]

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
was because of the terrorist attacks on
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
9 11 and the call to service
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
by the president of the united states to
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
join both the military
 
01:43:51.669 --> 01:43:51.679 align:start position:0%
and americorps
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
and i thought that that was a way that i
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
could serve and that's that's why i
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
decided to do it so i think these
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities are important to the
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
social fabric
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
of our country and brings diverse people
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
together from all different backgrounds
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
and walks of life from all across the
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
country um and i think it's important
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
that we do everything we can to
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
encourage and promote those types of
 
01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.390 align:start position:0%
encourage and promote those types of
opportunities

01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
to build national character
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
follow us
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
um well i know that your your bill
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
before us is for a commission and uh the
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
civilian core is not a mandatory issue
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
but considering that
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
it would be not too much to ask every
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
citizen in this country to do something
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't national service be
 
01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't national service be
mandatory

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i think
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know i think we would be better for
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
it if we if every citizen found
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
something that they could do i mean that
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
that was president george w bush's
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
challenge to the country which was
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
everybody should take a year or two of
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
their lives to serve their country and
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
their community um so you know i believe
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
in figuring out where in
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
any any american's life they can do that
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
i think uh by virtue of us all being in
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
this room today we are we are doing that
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
we are serving our communities in our
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
country um and i think national service
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm thank you for
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
your your bill
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
i just i'm i'm confused about a couple
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
the things that you
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
you seem to think or say that this uh
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
commission or this climate corps would
 
01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:47.430 align:start position:0%
commission or this climate corps would
do

01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that there are many uh
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
individual towns and cities
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
who have a very similar
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
type thing
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
not age required
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
and have those in action and they are
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.790 align:start position:0%
for the most part
volunteer

01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.070 align:start position:0%
volunteer
so

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
would this
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
commission augment
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on locally
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
it seems there's momentum building
 
01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:20.310 align:start position:0%
it seems there's momentum building
locally

01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
locally
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
would that take it away from that or
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
would this augment it
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
question uh this would augment it i
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
think more than anything it would uh
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
identify additional funding sources from
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government that could go to
 
01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.390 align:start position:0%
the federal government that could go to
support

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
programs that are happening at the state
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and local level you'll see that the
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
municipal association is included as one
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
of the members in part
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all municipalities
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
across the state understand
 
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.310 align:start position:0%
across the state understand
opportunities

01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of that kind of
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
funding and start programming i you know
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
i think about a park that is in my
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood stark park
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
and there have been a series of rail
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
trails that have
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
been built out and connected over the
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
course of the last couple years by
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
community volunteer groups that are
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
doing their own fundraising
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
i also know that the student
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
conservation association that's based at
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
bear brook state park
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
which is a big supporter of this
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
civilian climate corps
 
01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.229 align:start position:0%
civilian climate corps
program

01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
they helped out in a similar effort down
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
in nashua to build out trails you know
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
serving alongside community members and
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
providing additional expertise
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and and a heart you know great work
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
ethic you know these are
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
these are projects that are happening in
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
our communities there is a there is a
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
backlog of projects in a lot of
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
communities uh and this is an additional
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
resource that new hampshire could take
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
advantage of uh if we put together a
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
smart strategic plan to submit it to the
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
follow up my follow-up would be um
 
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.229 align:start position:0%
follow up my follow-up would be um
that

01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
the conservation corps that you refer to
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
was started in the 30s after the
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
depression because there was no work you
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
put people to work and we did marvelous
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
things with the people i wasn't in it
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
but the people who did it
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
did marvelous work today
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
we have the opposite effect we have
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
very low unemployment
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
and lack of employees so how would
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
affect that situation because that's a
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
very real situation right now
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
it is thank you for the follow-up
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of the work that the
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission worked on was focused on the
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
future and thinking about what kind of
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
skills employers are looking for
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think aligning
 
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.750 align:start position:0%
i think aligning
these

01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
these cores
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
these core programs national service uh
 
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
with workforce development skills so
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
that they can be employed
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
and have the skills to enter the
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
workforce in these high demand careers
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's a key part of this so
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
these are these are you know one
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
one year stints for the most part
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're between 10
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
10 months and 12 months
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and there are even some seasonal ones
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
that you know are great programs for
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
college students to participate in
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
during their summer breaks
 
01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:20.470 align:start position:0%
during their summer breaks
um

01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
and you know again the idea is for it to
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
be workforce development uh so that it
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
leads to
 
01:49:26.719 --> 01:49:27.510 align:start position:0%
leads to
uh

01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know good paying jobs that
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know employers are currently lacking
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the workforce
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm for your
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at a section of the
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
i guess it's
 
01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
i guess it's
just

01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
section one under duties
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
um where there's specificity listed here
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
of the duties of the commission to shape
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
launch and sustain new hampshire's
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
civilian climate corps program
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
aimed at conserving and restoring public
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
lands and waters
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
bolstering community resilience which
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
is is a pet
 
01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.589 align:start position:0%
is is a pet
pet

01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
pet
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
interest of mine because i think there
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
are a lot of things going on in terms of
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
changes in new hampshire
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
that are unaddressed because we just
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources we don't have
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
the you know the infrastructure in terms
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
of state government um
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
to help with those because i i actually
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
live on a pond a great pond and and i i
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
test the waters every year for the
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
departments you know of environmental
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
services water protection folks
 
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
services water protection folks
um

01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
so we already employ a lot of civilians
 
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:38.950 align:start position:0%
so we already employ a lot of civilians
but

01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
this section goes on to say
 
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
bolstering community resilience
 
01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
increasing reforestation
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
increasing carbon sequestration in
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
agriculture the agricultural sector
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
protecting biodiversity
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
improving access to recreation and
 
01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.550 align:start position:0%
improving access to recreation and
addressing

01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
addressing
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
the climate the changing climate and
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
what i like about the i know it's a it's
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
a long list but what i like about it is
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
from a scientific perspective you know
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
on this committee we listen to a lot of
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
bills that are energy specific in terms
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
of climate
 
01:51:11.679 --> 01:51:12.390 align:start position:0%
of climate
but

01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
biodiversity is another huge aspect of
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
what's changing
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere but also here
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could just say something
 
01:51:22.639 --> 01:51:24.070 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could just say something
about

01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:24.950 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
the breadth of this work like this is a
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
volunteer core
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
um who are going to be examining really
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
complex issues in terms of what's
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
changing within the state
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
so could you could you talk a little bit
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
about how you see i understand the idea
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
of getting the state involved so you can
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
leverage the federal dollars that makes
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
total sense to me bring bring more money
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
to us so we can do something about the
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
things that are happening but
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
bolstering community resilience can you
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
tell me what you mean by that like how
 
01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:53.589 align:start position:0%
tell me what you mean by that like how
would

01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
my farming community
 
01:51:55.679 --> 01:51:56.870 align:start position:0%
my farming community
um

01:51:56.870 --> 01:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
be affected if this bill went into place
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
and these people started to work on
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
coming up with you know what new
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire should be doing yeah thanks
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
for the question i mean this this list
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
came from recommendations by the by
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
america service commissions and the
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
service your alliance
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh they interface regularly with
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
americorps and
 
01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.830 align:start position:0%
americorps and
made

01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
state level recommendations for states
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
i think what's important is in the
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
reason that they've advised creating
 
01:52:27.599 --> 01:52:28.629 align:start position:0%
reason that they've advised creating
these

01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
state advisory commissions
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
is so that every state can custom tailor
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the activities of their
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
core members
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
to focus on high need
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
high impact issues
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
that may not be
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
an issue that new hampshire you know of
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
the list on the you know the menu
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
may not say hey this is this is high
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
priority for us but again i think the
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
list of uh commissioners is designed uh
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
to figure out which of those those
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
issues are most important okay thank you
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative thomas is
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
first a comment i want to congratulate
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
you and and say i i'm i'm encouraged
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
when you say that
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
we need to get back to young people
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
getting a
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
national character established i i think
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
we've gotten away from that and and i
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
think it's encouraging that young people
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
are thinking that we need to establish
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh back to our roots for how how we came
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the country and why we did and get
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
back to that essence of having a
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
national character of what it is to to
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
be americans
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
um that being said um
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
one question i have which is in your
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
testimony not in the bill but um on your
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
second page you talk a lot about what uh
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
what this volunteer organization could
 
01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.589 align:start position:0%
what this volunteer organization could
do

01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of it seems like it's it
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
may already be done by
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
for profit industries here in the state
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
so my question would be
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
do you see a conflict in what this what
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
this agency that you want to form
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
would do in terms of how it would affect
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
our for-profit businesses that are
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
already doing a lot of these things that
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
are being done now and how that blend
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
together how that makes
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
great i thank you for the question uh i
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
think it's important uh that you know
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
that it is in federal statute that
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
national service members cannot displace
 
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:31.589 align:start position:0%
national service members cannot displace
employees

01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
that are already doing this work and
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's across the private public and
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit sectors so
 
01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:38.790 align:start position:0%
non-profit sectors so
uh

01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know to be in compliance with
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be important for this
 
01:54:43.199 --> 01:54:44.790 align:start position:0%
it's going to be important for this
commission

01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
needs that are not being met by private
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
industry uh by
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know the state and by uh nonprofit
 
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
organizations but that are maybe on the
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
wish list of things that they they would
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
really like to be able to get to uh and
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
again look at it through a workforce
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
development lens uh so that you know
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
they're putting these core members in
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
positions where they can uh build the
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
skills that they need to then go on and
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
work for those
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
for-profit companies or for the state
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know or for non-profit organizations
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair for the follow-up
 
01:55:24.390 --> 01:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
this might be a naive question but do
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
you see this organization being
 
01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
you see this organization being
volunteer

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
and we have many volunteer organizations
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the state do you see this volunteer
 
01:55:33.119 --> 01:55:35.270 align:start position:0%
in the state do you see this volunteer
organization

01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
becoming or is it intent to become
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
a type of a lobbying group
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
no so that's another thing that you
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
should know about americorps and
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
civilian national services
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
when uh the corporation for national and
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
community service the federal agency
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
that oversees these programs was created
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh it was put into statute a couple
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
things i mean i'm actually thinking of a
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
long list of things that might be
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for this group to know one it's
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
intentionally bipartisan the the board
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
of directors of the federal agency um
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
are appointed by both majority minority
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
parties in washington d.c
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
so that there is that bipartisan
 
01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
support for the programs and guidance um
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
sorry can you get back to what what your
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
question oh it's about lobbying and no
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's something that is
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
strictly prohibited by americorps
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
members i mean otherwise
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
you know there'd be a room full of
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
americorps members and say yes we want
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
to expand these programs
 
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's not the case so i
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and know that
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
there are safeguards in place to
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
okay before we ask more questions i just
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
point out that
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
you came in a little late so you didn't
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
hear our
 
01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.990 align:start position:0%
hear our
opening

01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
opening
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
discussion but one of the things we
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
talked about was that we're here for
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
information gathering and if you
 
01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.350 align:start position:0%
information gathering and if you
ask

01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
crisp succinct questions you'll gather
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
more information
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
than if you ask long rambling questions
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
so i just uh ask you to be mindful of
 
01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.709 align:start position:0%
so i just uh ask you to be mindful of
that

01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of questions for you as
 
01:57:14.639 --> 01:57:15.510 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of questions for you as
well

01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
yes can i just say i so i have another
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%

that's helpful i'm also happy to give
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
them a heads up that i'm running late or
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
maybe we could ask someone to
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
go let them know that i'm running late
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
here well that clock is five minutes
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
fast oh that's perfect uh it's only
 
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.430 align:start position:0%
fast oh that's perfect uh it's only
1107.

01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
1107.
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
um how far away do you have to go to
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
tesla go down one floor just down one
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
floor okay let me just ask you a couple
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
of quick questions then
 
01:57:46.639 --> 01:57:47.910 align:start position:0%
of quick questions then
um

01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony mentioned climate corps
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
pilots across the country where do these
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
pilots get their funding
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
they're currently funded by americorps
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh in part but they also leverage those
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
federal dollars with local investment
 
01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:03.750 align:start position:0%
federal dollars with local investment
um

01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a federal match
 
01:58:05.679 --> 01:58:06.870 align:start position:0%
so there's there's a federal match
requirement

01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
part of the brilliance of the modern
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
national service movement is that there
 
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:10.709 align:start position:0%
national service movement is that there
is

01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
a public
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
private match requirement um when i was
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
serving with city or new hampshire we
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
were based out of timberland's corporate
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
headquarters in stratham
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that contributed towards the
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
program's match requirement
 
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.189 align:start position:0%
program's match requirement
so

01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up if there were any of
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
these climate corps
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
pilots started in new hampshire the
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
funding source would be americorps is
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct so student
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
conservation corps is a great example of
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
that it's the
 
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh and there's also a lakes region uh
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
conservation corps as well
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
that does similar work i think on a
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
seasonal basis
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative wilhelm i want to
