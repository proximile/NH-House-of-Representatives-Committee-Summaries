00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:13.030 align:start position:0%

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative weber thank you madam
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
chair as a preliminary matter i just
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
want to note that we were told that all
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
safety precautions were being taken when
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
we meet in this building and that
 
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
we meet in this building and that
included

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
rooms scheduled so that we could do
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate distancing yet here we all
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
are still sitting
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
very much too close to each other and i
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
would hope that at future meetings
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
the room arrangement would reflect a
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
more appropriate disposition
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your comment
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative weber the handy thing
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
about our name plates is that they can
 
00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
about our name plates is that they can
move

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
um so can members so if someone feels
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
that if they're not sitting in an
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate place feel
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
free to move your name plate to a
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
different spot on the table the mics
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
look like they have plenty of cord
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
to be moved around to accommodate your
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
personal request
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
which we're always happy to try and meet
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
the first thing on the agenda is i'm
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking for any comments from members on
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
how it's going with the program we
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
passed out a thumb drive with a program
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
that had
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
two different
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
programs on it so to speak and i used
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
the wrong terminology with computer
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
things for house districts and
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
congressional districts
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
i know some of us have spent some very
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
frustrating evenings working on it and i
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to sort of get some feedback
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
on how people are doing because at some
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
point we need to start talking about
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
actual maps representative mcguire did i
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
see your hand
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i've been working mostly
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
on the house districts
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
and specifically in merrimack county
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh the the program works very nicely but
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
concord wards
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
varying by a rep and a hat
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
by about fifteen hundred people
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
i can't do come up with a complete map
 
00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
i can't do come up with a complete map
because

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.069 align:start position:0%
because
concord

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be isolated from the rest of the
 
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.269 align:start position:0%
cannot be isolated from the rest of the
county

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
franklin they're probably glad to hear
 
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.150 align:start position:0%
franklin they're probably glad to hear
that

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes well
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
they would they're part of the county
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
we've got it got to deal with it
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
there are sections of the of my map that
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm quite happy with there are others
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
that i am not and i really need concord
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
in order to to balance it
 
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.269 align:start position:0%
in order to to balance it
i

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
was on
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's a lit i i have a hard time telling
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
whether these buttons are down or up or
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
what the schematic is but is that on
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
hearing no
 
00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.509 align:start position:0%
hearing no
okay

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
okay well i think this meeting is going
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
to be fraught with is that sound
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes now i can think a little sorry about
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
that so i'll repeat i've been working on
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
the county maps
 
00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.590 align:start position:0%
the county maps
and

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
particularly merrimack county
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i can't get very far without having
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
proper awards in concord
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
the county commissioners for merrimack
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
are exactly 15 reps each so i've got two
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
different plans that i'm happy with for
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
county commissioners
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
in merrimack and i've been working on
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
from grafton county
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to get small compact
 
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.949 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to get small compact
districts

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult to give each
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
town its own rep because of all the tiny
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
towns that are
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
around the mall and maintaining the
 
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
around the mall and maintaining the
variances

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
variances
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing your experience
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
with trying to work on the program does
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative weber i'll just state
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
that i don't have anything to add yet
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
because i have as yet
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
to buy the piece of equipment that will
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
allow the thumb drive to connect to my
 
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.949 align:start position:0%
allow the thumb drive to connect to my
computer

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
as we've only had three of the listening
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
sessions i will i will be working on
 
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.069 align:start position:0%
sessions i will i will be working on
that

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
okay i also have just had a further
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
message that there is still no sound for
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
those who are trying to view all right
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
is uh somebody from house
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
watching that somebody is getting a text
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
that there is no sound
 
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:36.310 align:start position:0%
that there is no sound
um

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.150 align:start position:0%
um
can

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
somebody christina dyer from legislative
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
the legislative office says that the
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
sound is working
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's something in every meeting when
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
there are elect electronics involved as
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
to what works and what doesn't work it's
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat astounding i know that there
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
was someone outside in the hall from
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
tech services
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
a few minutes ago so i'm presuming it
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
started all right
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what's happened in the
 
00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.470 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what's happened in the
meantime

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
meantime
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to pause for a minute until
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
we get straightened out on the sound
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
given that we are live streaming this
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
this is also being
 
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.230 align:start position:0%
this is also being
recorded

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
recorded
so

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
so
we

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
sound is up and running i suspect some
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
of this has to do with member volume and
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
how close the microphone is to us
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
amplification and recording and we need
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
to be mindful of it and i apologize
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative weber thank you for
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
giving us that update
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
i do know that i have had a
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative tell me that this is not
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
an exercise you want to do a half an
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
hour before you're going to bed because
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
it just gets you completely
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
riled up
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative bergeron oh
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i would just note
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
that the software the the program that
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
was developed 10 years ago isn't
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
compatible with apple so those of us
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
that have apple computers are having a
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
bear of a time making it work i don't
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
know if
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
i t could convert it to an apple
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
friendly program or not
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
but i would welcome that if it can be
 
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.110 align:start position:0%
but i would welcome that if it can be
done

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing that
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can ask it about if somebody
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
wants to take the program and um take it
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
from a thumb drive to put it on a dvr or
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
something like that that their computer
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
might read i'm sure we can provide that
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
service also
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
anybody else on the actual mapping
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire repre reference
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
county commissioners we're sort of
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
focused on the house because that is who
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
we are right here but county
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
commissioners will need to be done in
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
every county
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
that program has been done my apologies
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
we didn't have thumb drives
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
or perhaps other drives available for
 
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.829 align:start position:0%
or perhaps other drives available for
everybody

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
but we will get that to you so that you
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
can work on that piece
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
every county has districts four county
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
commissioners except strat stratford is
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
that correct representative turcotte
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
stratford is currently at large
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
everybody else has districts so that is
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
going to be a slightly different
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
formulation for you to work on and we'll
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
get that to you
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
the next thing on the agenda is
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
something that was brought to my
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
something that was brought to my
attention

00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
by perusal of lsrs
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
legislative service requests for
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
2022 have been filed
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
and if you look at them you will note
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
that there is one for a constitutional
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
amendment dealing with the number of
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
representatives and the number of
 
00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.389 align:start position:0%
representatives and the number of
senators

00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
senators
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it occurred to me that while we had
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the constitutional
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for redistricting and voted
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
on it such as county lines we had not
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually discussed the number of
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
representatives which by constitution
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
can be 375 to 400.
 
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.710 align:start position:0%
can be 375 to 400.
so

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
with that in mind
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
i asked
 
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
i asked
representative

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
allocation previously that we had looked
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
at and adopted in regards to county
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
numbers to take a look at what would
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
happen if we varied the number of reps
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
the committee members received and this
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
will go online
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
of what happens with the county
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
breakouts for representatives if we go
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
from the 375 to 400 part of the reason
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
this discussion is
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
important is because
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
there is a need to allocate
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
representatives proportionately
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
within certain numerical standards and
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you start off
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
with a formula that already is not
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
balanced it makes subsequent work to
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
balance things within
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
your percentage of deviation
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
which is why
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're seeing sort of some fluctuations
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
in representatives for county from
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
2010 to 2020 that are not apparent by
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
the gross numbers
 
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.029 align:start position:0%
the gross numbers
so

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
rep representative
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
barry excuse me for i think i refer to
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
you as representative ross
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
if you could explain
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
the sheet that
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
i can read if it's very close to my face
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman thank you
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's very small because there's um
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's 25 permutations
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
for 10 counties so there's 250 pieces of
 
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.150 align:start position:0%
for 10 counties so there's 250 pieces of
data

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
that you start with when you're looking
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
at equal or
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't say equal but
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
proportioning by county
 
00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:15.270 align:start position:0%
proportioning by county
so

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of walk the committee through
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
the sheet
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
the very first we'll call it section of
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
data that you'll see
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
which has the county names
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
the first number you'll see the right of
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
those county names is their total
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
population right that's not for debate
 
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.669 align:start position:0%
population right that's not for debate
um

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see at the top of that a
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
a new
 
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.070 align:start position:0%
a new
row

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
row
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
in bold which has 400 399 398 going down
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
all the way to 375 and it shows you what
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
the perfect allocation
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
would be per county if that number of
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
representatives was instituted so we
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
obviously know what 400 is because we've
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
been doing all of our math based off of
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
that but it goes all the way down
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
there and then underneath that you'll
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
see very similar to the sheet that was
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
distributed i believe in our our second
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
meeting maybe our third
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
where we i've rounded them down
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
so using perfect rounding right so if
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's 18.49 it goes to 18 if it's 18.51
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
it goes to 19.
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
and you can see what that is per county
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
the one underneath that
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
is the ones all the the pretty colors
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is how far away they are from zero
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
um so let's take uh belknap county
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the 400
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
if we had 400 state representatives they
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
right so basically what we're doing is
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
we're chopping off the 18 and we're
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
saying all right well they're 0.49 off
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
from zero
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
conversely if they were high right so
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
carroll county is high 14.54
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
you'll see that underneath there they're
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
at 0.45 right so it's because it's
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
easier for them to go up than it is for
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
go to go down right so we're looking at
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
the difference to zero right whatever
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the closest
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
next whole number is if you will
 
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.110 align:start position:0%
next whole number is if you will
um

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
so that's how far they're off so the
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
reason that they're color coded is
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to be as close to the
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
nearest whole number as possible right
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
because that's the most
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
even proportional representation
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
possible obviously there's no perfect
 
00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:22.789 align:start position:0%
possible obviously there's no perfect
solution

00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to present to the committee
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
what that looks like so red is bad green
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
and yellow is in the middle
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
so um you could see 400 i just want to
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
you can see that 400 is not ideal
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
but that's what we've traditionally had
 
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.549 align:start position:0%
but that's what we've traditionally had
um

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
and it i'll i'll point out to 391 again
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
because 391 happens to be the best well
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
the best by
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
the standard of perfect distribution or
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
near perfect distribution underneath
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
that you'll see one more distribute one
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
more um
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
this is the average median standard
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
deviation and largest deviation
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
so the average remember this is how far
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
they are from perfect right so this is
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
all 10 counties collectively how far
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
away they are
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a perfect way of looking at
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
this because the counties are obviously
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
not all the same population
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
but we're trying we've we set that in as
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
a boundary already so we're kind of
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
already working every time we you know
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
set a new standard we're moving farther
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
away from the perfect ideal right the
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
three four four three r three four four
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
four um
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
so underneath that is the median
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
if you're going back to your fifth sixth
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
or seventh grade math class um
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the um
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
the number that's the number that if you
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
line them all up the one that's closest
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
to the middle
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
the one that's closest to the middle uh
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
the standard deviation so the standard
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
deviation this statistical term it's
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
basically their distribution so this is
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
not the standard deviation is not from
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
zero the standard deviation is from
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
their average but what the standard
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
deviation does is it lets you know how
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
far away they are separated from each
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
other right so in an ideal world we want
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
them to all be
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
equally as off right um
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
you know um because we're already
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with an imperfect world um and
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
then the largest deviation that one's
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
not rocket sciences that is which county
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
has the farthest away from the ideal
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
so um once again belknap county did me a
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
huge favor by being the the
 
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
huge favor by being the the
bel

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
bel
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
and in 400 so if you look at them
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're 0.49834 there's really no other
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
way to be farther away from zero
 
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.510 align:start position:0%
way to be farther away from zero
than

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
than
0.49834

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
0.49834
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
so you'll see they are the largest
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
deviation um and that changes i don't
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
have which counties labeled for that um
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
but that just kind of shows you how far
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
off so you can look at 400 you can look
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
at it all the way down to 375. i point
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
out 391
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
because it kind of actually is the best
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
looking you have two other sheets with
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
you that are not in pretty colors
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
but all this is is the data broken out
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
into a line graph and a bar chart
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
so the the line graph um
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
is the easiest one to kind of look at
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
and get a fast assessment of the
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
distribution by um number and that's
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
where 391 you can really just look at it
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
lower is better right we want that
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
number as close to zero as possible um
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
so you can see 391 is is very nice but
 
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
so you can see 391 is is very nice but
um

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
so that is that that is that massive
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
amounts of sheet in a very very small
 
00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:46.149 align:start position:0%
amounts of sheet in a very very small
print

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
print
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you and i'm
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions anybody
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
has about it
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um for doing
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
this it's very interesting and
 
00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.950 align:start position:0%
this it's very interesting and
um

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.669 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm impressed so thank you
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer i'm sure the lawyers on the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee can can agree
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
we're not as good with numbers um can
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
you explain to me so for example we're
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
a 391 which you you mentioned is the has
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
the least
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
i guess deviation from the perfect
 
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.909 align:start position:0%
i guess deviation from the perfect
proportion

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
proportion
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
so what is the the benefit of that from
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
a mapping standpoint
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
um i i i don't think i can answer that
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
question from a mapping standpoint um
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's i'm thinking it more of as a as a
 
00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.830 align:start position:0%
it's i'm thinking it more of as a as a
representation

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
inside the i i guess i guess the answer
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
that would be it would be easier to draw
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
the maps at that level
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
um but that doesn't mean that we should
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
um we've had 400 for quite some time i'm
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
not advocating that we moved to 391 but
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think the committee needs to look at
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
very impressive
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that what this
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
might represent
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
most

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
closest to perfect allegation of reps
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
per county
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that correct because because we
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
believe we cannot count cross county
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
lines because
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
um the state representatives make up the
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
county delegation
 
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
county delegation
um

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're already dealing with an imperfect
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
system right off the bat we're not like
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
other states or state representative
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
districts i i'm not aware of another
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
state where a state representative
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
cannot cross a county line
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
i could be mistaken in that so don't
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to that but i'm not aware
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
of one but because we operate under that
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
equal protection one man one vote
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
principle that's assigned with county
 
00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.549 align:start position:0%
principle that's assigned with county
government

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
we are already operating underneath a i
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't want to say flawed but
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative berry i'm curious
 
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.070 align:start position:0%
uh representative berry i'm curious
if

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to 300 391 representatives
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
does it actually make it easier for us
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
to map within each county
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
in theory it would um because you would
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
be dealing with remember because we're
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
still even when we go into a side of a
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
county like so with 400 we know it's
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
three four four four um i think it's
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
three four four point four four
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
3.44438 to be somewhat close
 
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.350 align:start position:0%
3.44438 to be somewhat close
um

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
but so you you would in theory be
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
getting be a little easier to draw the
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
maps um because you would be you would
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
have less deviation from the perfect to
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
begin with right so you're you're not
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
starting as far out from zero or in in
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
reality and remember this is this is to
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
zero right so i didn't go through and
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
program it to be 0.05 and negative 0.05
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
right which i could have done
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
which you can excuse me you can still do
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
the math right everything just comes
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
down 0.05
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
so um i i guess my assumption would be
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
that it would i've never i didn't look
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
at it from that i was just looking at it
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
from a
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know what is the what is the
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative it is purely a it was
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
purely for me a a
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
a statistical study of what is the what
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
does it look like if we do what is
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
allowed via the legislative our
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
constant our excuse me legend
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
our laws good lord
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
which is 375-400
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
as i'm i'm remembering from last time
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
that i come from a county that was
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
entitled to 23.48
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
representatives and of course that got
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
rounded down to 23.
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
and i will say that it does actually
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
make a difference when you try and come
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
to do the mapping because it's all
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's the deviations are already skewed
 
00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:08.149 align:start position:0%
it's the deviations are already skewed
um

00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
and i remember
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
coming up with a map that would have
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
worked really really well if only we
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
changed dublin and gave it to
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county and dublin was
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
about 1500 which was just about half of
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
one representative
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
but that didn't happen uh so on a purely
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
mathematical level i think i think it
 
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.789 align:start position:0%
mathematical level i think i think it
would

00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
be better
 
00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:36.149 align:start position:0%
be better
i

00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:37.990 align:start position:0%
i
wonder

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
wonder
what

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.350 align:start position:0%
what
the

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
response is
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
from people
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
for whom this will mean
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
significant disruption in what they
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
think of as the status quo and what they
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
like in the places that they like it i
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
know that there are places where they
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't like it
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure how
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
the going from
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
from 3000
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's not something that should make a
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
difference but it may make a difference
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what kind of difference
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
it makes and i i certainly
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
before we go too far down this road and
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
start redoing map making software and
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
things like that i'd sure like an
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hear from the public
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
about their thoughts about it i do know
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
that we had testimony from one member of
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
who suggested that
 
00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:36.230 align:start position:0%
who suggested that
375

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
375
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
would be a better iteration than 400
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh but i don't think he took into
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
account all the other ones in between so
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
i i i thank the representative very much
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
for his comprehensive work
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
if members want to turn to
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative smith steve smith
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
and thanks for that work ross it is good
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
to see but i think it's
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
highlighting the difficulty of the job
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have because i don't think it should
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
be a goal this committee to provide
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
people with less representation in the
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
interests of mathematical efficacy
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'd rather do the the hard work right
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
now of doing that because if that is
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
what we cared about you could probably
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
get really good numbers by going to each
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
county find a town and municipality
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's within a reasonable deviation a
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
perfect population give them their own
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
rep or reps
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
make the rest of the county one at large
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
district and be done with it
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's what anybody
 
00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:36.310 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's what anybody
wants

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
wants
 
00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
wants
so

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers 400 i don't want to give new
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire people less representatives
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
than that and i'm willing to have my
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
eyes bleed to try to facilitate it
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
um in regards to this issue this has
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
obviously been an issue that's come
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
before the house before
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
in front of you two memos that have been
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee that will be
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
placed online in regards to
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
how has the constitution changed in
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
regards to this issue to its current
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
date and how
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
what if any efforts have been made to
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
change the numbers
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
um there is an interesting history that
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
goes through the 1784 constitution
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
which actually was intended to fix what
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
was being done without a
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
constitution and then there have been
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
four amendments since then
 
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.909 align:start position:0%
four amendments since then
of

00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
interest probably in line with
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
what members have said are proposals to
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
reduce the size of the house quite
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
frankly i had no idea that there were
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
this many
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
attempts to change the number until
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
staff had put it together
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
1969

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
1969
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
and there have been five ten
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
fifteen at least twenty proposals
 
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
fifteen at least twenty proposals
including

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
four since two thousand to change the
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
size of representatives
 
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.590 align:start position:0%
size of representatives
um

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
so all of them have been defeated by in
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
the house by a voice vote
 
00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:16.710 align:start position:0%
the house by a voice vote
um

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
so i i think i probably shared the
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
sentiments of everybody who has spoken
 
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.549 align:start position:0%
sentiments of everybody who has spoken
here

00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
here
but

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
once again i think perhaps i thought
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
something that was good to consider but
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it makes sense to implement
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
it in this
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
process so
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you madam
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
similar to represent
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith um
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
potential for ease of mapping
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
which i'll speak to in my second point
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
would outweigh the changing of the
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
number uh from 400 down to a
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
any number less than 400 i think there's
 
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh the redistricting processes
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
filled filled with enough land mines
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
that we don't probably need to add too
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
many more in there and i think this
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
would be one of them
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
having spent
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
many many many many many many hours and
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned before
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't anybody do it after about seven or
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
eight at night because you will be up
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
all night thinking about it
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
but um i'm not necessarily sure
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
that changing the number would actually
 
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
that changing the number would actually
make

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
the mapping of at least in the house of
 
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.069 align:start position:0%
the mapping of at least in the house of
representatives

00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.109 align:start position:0%
representatives
any

00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
any simpler
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
where we're doing it county by
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
county um
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
yeah we might have a large deviation say
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
for belt map in that first square where
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's 0.498
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
but you're still you can still i believe
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
map the county with equal deviations
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
within the county so i'm not so sure
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
although i do like when you look at 391
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
i mean the colors the color mapping does
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
show you that in fact that
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
on a county basis reps per county
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.550 align:start position:0%
it is
uh

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
more beneficial i don't think actually
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
in in terms of mapping individual
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
counties and that's pretty much all i've
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
been doing
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not so sure that'll make a
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
difference so i i i would say to
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to change the number down from
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
400 at this point would probably not be
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's um worth
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
noting when you mentioned that
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
it was defeated in the house through
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
multiple administrations going back
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
decades on a voice vote that the only
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
way that could have happened was that
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
the motion came to the floor itl
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
so not only was it defeated
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
it came out of committee with the
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation of an expedient to
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislate on these two pages i counted
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
19 times
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
i just want to make it clear that we're
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
talking about apples and oranges here um
 
00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.670 align:start position:0%
talking about apples and oranges here um
the

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh impressive research about all the
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
other attempts to change the size of the
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
house or constitutional amendments that
 
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
house or constitutional amendments that
would

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
lower the number significantly below the
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
currently permitted 375 to 400
 
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.990 align:start position:0%
currently permitted 375 to 400
whereas

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
what i think we're discussing today is
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
not a constitutional amendment to lower
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
the house numbers beyond 375
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
but to pick a number between 375 and 400
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
which we're currently allowed to do
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that necessarily
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
means it would be any more popular i
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
if we're using the constitutional
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
amendments as a point of reference for
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
why we should or shouldn't do this it's
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
not the same animal
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber for
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
pointing out that distinction and just
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
so the public is aware we're apparently
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
also defeating moves to either pay us or
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
remove the hundred dollars at the same
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
time so it's been quite the history
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative marjorie smith
 
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
representative marjorie smith
okay

00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
i thank you
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair i particularly want to thank
 
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.270 align:start position:0%
madam chair i particularly want to thank
you

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.069 align:start position:0%
you
for

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.030 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
initiating this research um
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
with the committee researcher i always
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
get hung up on policy that's what i care
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
about and i found it fascinating
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
to read that that history
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
that this committee
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
is facing a series of obstacles
 
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.950 align:start position:0%
is facing a series of obstacles
that

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
we have no real control
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
over at this point and i would
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
hope that we might use this conversation
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
research as an opportunity to open a
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that's not going to affect
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
what we do in terms of our allocation
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
but might
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
put in in play
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
something that could make this system
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
work to the benefit of all the citizens
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the state so that
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
i could see us considering
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
we should not be limited
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
by county boundaries
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
that would make tremendous change in
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
this state and change that i think might
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
be for the good but it might not be if
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
we look at it in terms of changing how
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
we structure county government so that
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
we are no longer
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the county
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
government all of that is
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
fascinating policy
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
but today it seems to me
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we can't negotiate those changes in
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
any way that is fair to the citizens of
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.870 align:start position:0%
the state
and

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
i do like the fact that it's almost
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
october and this chart shows us
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
beautiful fall colors
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
i immediately went to 391 because i
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
could see
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
the greens and the yellows
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
i realized that four out of the ten
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
counties wouldn't change at all
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
one would change by three one by
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
two the rest by one
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
that is a major
 
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.670 align:start position:0%
that is a major
change

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
and i think we're going to have enough
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
slings and arrows focused on us
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
have other reasons to challenge
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriateness of what we're doing
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i hope the issue doesn't go away i
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
hope we pay attention to it it might
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
require constitutional amendments it
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
might require legislative change
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
but not today
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and again thank you for
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
this research i would never in a million
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
years been able to do it on my own
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
piggybacks a little bit on represents
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
smith's which was
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
what was the purpose when they put in
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
the 375 to 400 why did they do that and
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think these memos really address
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know from my viewpoint what was the
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of giving that gap if
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's not to consider it in this room
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
i guess representative lane i can't
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
remember what the legislative intent was
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
last year and i wasn't around back then
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
so i would hate to deem to guess what
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent was
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
okay i mean i just wonder if there's a
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
as follow-up yeah so i'm just wondering
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
why put it in there if it's not to take
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
it into consideration when we're sitting
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
here trying to do redistricting i i
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
understand your question and i think if
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
you look at the history of the
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
amendments you might be able to make an
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
educated guess but
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
i i suspect maybe that will be a
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
question that whoever gets the lsr
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
proposing a rather significant change in
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
the number of representatives and
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
senators will have to grapple with i
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
think i agree with the statement of many
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's probably not a subject for us to
 
00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.589 align:start position:0%
it's probably not a subject for us to
discuss

00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
any other comments on this
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
all right well given that we have
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
complying with the constitutional
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines for redistricting
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
i would ask someone for a motion in
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
regards to complying with the
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional guidelines in regards to
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
the number of representatives that we
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
will be using for drawing the maps for
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives in new
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire representative smith
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i move that for
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the 2020 redistricting
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives number be
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
set at 400.
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
is there a second second seconds
 
00:42:14.829 --> 00:42:14.839 align:start position:0%
is there any further
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representatives marjorie
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
smith thank you very much
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
could i ask
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
why you believe
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
the motion is necessary
 
00:42:28.839 --> 00:42:30.470 align:start position:0%
the motion is necessary
um

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
since the status quo
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
is 400
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
we are functioning within the existing
 
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
we are functioning within the existing
parameters

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
why would we need
 
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.069 align:start position:0%
why would we need
to

00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
have a motion
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
on this at this point and i ask that
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
because there are other
 
00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:53.349 align:start position:0%
because there are other
um

00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
points that have been made quite
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
eloquently i think in the
 
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.829 align:start position:0%
eloquently i think in the
three

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
listening sessions that we've been able
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
to schedule so far where for example
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
seem to make a lot of sense to pay
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
attention to school districts and
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
drawing lines thank you representative
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
smith for your comments i think that
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between
 
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.710 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between
constitutional

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
issues and issues in regards to what
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
some people might say is pertinent in
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
discussions regarding
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
the determination of ward lines
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
additionally this committee has already
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
taken votes on certain constitutional
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
provisions so given that the question
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
arose in my mind there's an lsr coming
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i suspect this might be a discussion
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the future i bring it forward to the
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee for a vote representative
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
turcotte thank you madam chair um to
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
specific specifically to representative
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
marjorie smith's
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
comment i think the reason for this is
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are spending
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
inordinate amounts of time
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
doing the mapping
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
it would be very helpful going forward
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
to know if we're going to be using the
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
number 400 the number 375 the number 391
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
or whatever we have some other issues
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
coming up later in this meeting that is
 
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.470 align:start position:0%
coming up later in this meeting that is
similar

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
to spin wheels
 
00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.309 align:start position:0%
to spin wheels
[Music]

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
attempting to map counties
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
when you don't know if that's the number
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to be using is is a waste
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
of time so this is a way to nail down a
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
number so we can actually move forward
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
with the mapping process for those of us
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
who are actually doing it
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative steve smith
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think the motion
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
is necessary because we're permitted to
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
do 375 to 400 from a procedural
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint i don't want to be a week or
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
two from the finish line and then have
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
to consider maps based on another number
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
but most importantly
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
um transparency is the word of the day
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
and we should tell the public straight
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
up what criteria we're using and that's
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
why i made the motion
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative barry uh yes madam
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um i will be voting to keep the
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
representation at 400
 
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.309 align:start position:0%
representation at 400
based

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
largely on what the committee has said
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
today and not to
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
speak for representative marjorie smith
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
but i believe this is already going to
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
be a complicated enough process as it is
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
it already has enough pitfalls in front
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
of us and points of potential failure
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
that i think adding another one would be
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
foolish for the committee
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it will make
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
life a little more difficult on the
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
drawing point but i think in terms of
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
getting maps out that represent the
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:36.390 align:start position:0%
people um
quickly

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
that keeping it as it is right now is
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
probably in the committee's best
 
00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:40.950 align:start position:0%
probably in the committee's best
interest

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion representative
 
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:49.349 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion representative
weber

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
i just want to be sure that we're not
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
foreclosing something that we might find
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
later on might be useful
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
am i right in thinking madam chair that
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody provides us with a map that
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
looks really very
 
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.150 align:start position:0%
looks really very
good

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of all of the parameters that
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing about from the people
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
who have come to our listening sessions
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that that map was at
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
391 or 375 or a different number
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh could we not then vote to change our
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
minds and accept that or i mean are our
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
votes here cast in stone at this point
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
i think the three-page memo shows that
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
nothing's cast in stone
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
procedure is always subject to motions
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire representative
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
mcguire yes thank you
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
one point is that the more
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
representatives we have
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
the smaller the towns that would be
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
entitled to get their own
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that's something that a lot of
 
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
and that's something that a lot of
people

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
devoutly wish
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
even if and even if it's not possible
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
deviations and the size of towns
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%

computer
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
is a discussion on the methodology
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
to be presented to the committee by
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
david andrews from open democracy action
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
um i have asked mr andrews to come here
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
today mr andrews if you want to come up
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
to the the table
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
mr andrews and i are almost on first
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
first name basis now he has uh been a
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
trooper and spoken at every public input
 
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.870 align:start position:0%
trooper and spoken at every public input
session

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
um by the end of this i i will know what
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
his favorite color is
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe what he likes for lunch
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
some of us are aware
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
of something called the mapathon project
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
which has been working on
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
maps some of which two of which were
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
presented at a public input session last
 
00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.190 align:start position:0%
presented at a public input session last
week

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the interest of having a discussion
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
on the methodology
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we have been seeing every week
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
i recall that mr andrews gave an
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
explanation at the first public input
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
session in merrimack
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
which supplemented a submission you have
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
all received by email in regards to the
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
methodology and i thought that his
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
explanation was helpful to me i am not
 
00:49:31.589 --> 00:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
quite as good with numbers as
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh some of us are obviously so i asked
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
mr andrews to come today and he has
 
00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.470 align:start position:0%
mr andrews to come today and he has
graciously

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
graciously
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
agreed so uh to come here to talk about
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
the methodology
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
um that he's using and uh he has
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
provided i'm assuming these are from you
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
on my table um i asked him to bring
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
things if he wanted to refer to if he
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
wanted us to refer to him so with that i
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
i will welcome mr andrews thank you for
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
coming this morning and adjusting your
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
schedule yeah thank you for having me um
 
00:50:03.119 --> 00:50:04.150 align:start position:0%
schedule yeah thank you for having me um
so

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
just very quickly uh i've been doing a
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
lot of different mapping whether it be
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
congressional down to the new hampshire
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
house and i understand the the struggles
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
that you are having especially with the
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house and the difficulties
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
of it with the constraints that are that
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
are that are put forth onto it uh and
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
one of those constraints is the method
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
of calculating flow terials
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
when i had started the process
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the 2010 maps and i was
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
i was trying to give more towns their
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
their own districts and i i was
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
struggling and struggling and i i
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
was only able to come up with a few here
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
there and so
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh what i thought was i thought that
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
maybe there was a better way
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
to calculate flow terials
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
and thus allow for more towns that have
 
00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.109 align:start position:0%
and thus allow for more towns that have
the

00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh correct the enough population to have
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
their own districts um so what i did was
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
i uh used the
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
a variation of the current method that
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
is uh that is done so um first uh
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to go over a quick history
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the floater because it puts it a
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
little bit in context so in 2000 um maps
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
were drawn using what is called the
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
aggregate method which is what most
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
people assume floaterials are are are
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
calculated is it's kind of you take the
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
extra people from
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
two different districts and you make a
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
floaterial out of it if all the
 
00:51:36.319 --> 00:51:39.750 align:start position:0%
floaterial out of it if all the
districts

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
add up to within five percent of the
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
deviation it's good to go
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
but in 2002
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
the maps were challenged in the new
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court in burling v
 
00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:50.549 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court in burling v
chandler

00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
chandler
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
and in that ruling
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court ruled
 
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.750 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court ruled
that

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
you could not use the aggregate method
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
in order to calculate flow terials
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
because if say
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
one town gives only a hundred people to
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
the floaterial and the other town gives
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
three thousand
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's not very fair to the one person one
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
vote rule um so what the new hampshire
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
supreme court said was that you need to
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
factor in that floaterial deviation
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
and what they did was they proposed a
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
method called the component method which
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll talk about in more detail
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
so they ruled that the aggregate method
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional based on the one
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
person one vote rule and they proposed
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
the component method as a as a way that
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
calculate flow terials but they didn't
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
rule out anything else so that's kind of
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
where my method comes in into account
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
so in 2010
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
the component method was used this is
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
the same method that is used in your
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
program to calculate flow tarials
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
but in 2010 62 towns that were eligible
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
for their own district uh were not
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
allowed mostly because of the
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
constraints of this
 
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:06.470 align:start position:0%
component method
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.470 align:start position:0%
component method
[Music]

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
so first off i
 
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:11.990 align:start position:0%
so first off i
um

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
the if you want to look at the it's the
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
handout with the new hampshire house map
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
on it and i'm on page
 
00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:20.710 align:start position:0%
on it and i'm on page
three

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
which is the aggregate method um
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i kind of explained it already it's
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
it was ruled unconstitutional so i'm not
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
gonna get into too much of it but it's
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
really just the
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
you add up everybody from the districts
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
divide by the ideal population and if
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's within um plus or minus five
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
percent then it's good to go
 
00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.829 align:start position:0%
percent then it's good to go
but

00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
again it doesn't factor in the
 
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
again it doesn't factor in the
floaterial

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
floaterial
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
deviation into its calculation
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so if we go on to the component
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
method which is the current method
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a bit of a complex equation
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
as you can see but in essence what it
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
does is it weighs
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
the um the extra people from each
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
district and then tries to make sure
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
that those two
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
populations are are pretty equal
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what that kind of uh equation
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
so i get i give an example on the next
 
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:25.190 align:start position:0%
so i get i give an example on the next
page

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
so if there's a district with 5 000
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
people a district with 4 000 people if
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
you run that through the component
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
method it comes up with uh
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
the deviation for the floateral seat as
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
7.11 for uh district a and negative 7.66
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
for district b so in this case it would
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
not be allowed
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
to to be a floaterial district um
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
even though
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
i think intuitively it would make sense
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.950 align:start position:0%
to you know
um

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
allow for that
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
what i thought was
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
um so the one thing that
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
the component method doesn't take into
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
account which my alternative component
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
method does
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
is the deviation of the non-floaterial
 
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.589 align:start position:0%
is the deviation of the non-floaterial
seats

00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
seats
 
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:18.230 align:start position:0%
seats
so

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:21.990 align:start position:0%
being able to
um

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
factor in the plus or plus or minus five
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
percent deviation in not only the
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
floaterial seat but the other
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial seats as well it allows
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
for just a little bit of extra
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
just to
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
allow for more possibilities in the
 
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:41.050 align:start position:0%
mapping process
 
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:42.549 align:start position:0%
mapping process
[Music]

00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
so again you can see in the next example
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
i use i use the same um
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
populations for the districts
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
and with using the
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
alternative component method um you can
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
see that it's actually allowed to to be
 
00:55:58.559 --> 00:55:59.349 align:start position:0%
see that it's actually allowed to to be
a

00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
floaterial district in this example
 
00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:04.710 align:start position:0%
floaterial district in this example
so

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.670 align:start position:0%
so
it

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
it does allow for a little bit more
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
wiggle room in um districting but
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
it does it it's not as flexible as the
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
aggregate method is and so you can see
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the next example if we just move 250
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
people from one district to the other
 
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.910 align:start position:0%
people from one district to the other
um

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
then the alternative component method no
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
longer works for that so it's not just
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
as flexible as possible there's there is
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
some still constraints on it and it
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
still follows the new hampshire supreme
 
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.349 align:start position:0%
still follows the new hampshire supreme
court's

00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
idea

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the floaterial district deviation
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the uh mapping process
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
so uh if you look at the the next page
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is the real kind of
 
00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
this is the real kind of
important

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
point of this so i've done
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
i've drawn maps for all of the different
 
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.190 align:start position:0%
i've drawn maps for all of the different
counties

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for the the house and
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying they're they're the best
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
ones out there i'm sure that they can be
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
approved of but i spent
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
many hours doing this
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
and um this was the the best that i
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
could come up with on my own uh so you
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
can see that just using the regular
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
component method i had uh
 
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
component method i had uh
67

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
67
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
cases where towns that should have their
 
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
cases where towns that should have their
own

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
districts were were not able to
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
seven of which are kind of necessary
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
one is the fault of my own town
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
chichester because it's surrounded by
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
larger towns so it needs to be combined
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
with somebody so
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's the case for
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
for those seven
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
necessary violations um
 
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
necessary violations um
so

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
really so 60 unnecessary violations in
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
with the component method but you can
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
see that with the alternative component
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
method it allows for just that little
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
bit of extra wiggle room and so i was
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
able to get it down to 19 unnecessary
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
violations so only so really 41 extra
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
towns were able to be given their own
 
00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
towns were able to be given their own
districts

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
and thus i think follow the constitution
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
a lot uh a lot better and you can see i
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
give uh two examples one is merrimack
 
00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:28.630 align:start position:0%
give uh two examples one is merrimack
county

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.910 align:start position:0%
county
um

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
you can see that there's uh 10
 
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.750 align:start position:0%
you can see that there's uh 10
violations

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
violations
in

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
the the above map and then only two
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
which are both necessary violations um
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
because of rochester and canterbury and
 
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
because of rochester and canterbury and
dunbarton

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
dunbarton
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
so it really just allows for that little
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
bit of extra wiggle room to uh have
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
districts that
 
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.750 align:start position:0%
districts that
uh

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
that that i think work better to follow
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution and then
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
again uh
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
hillsboro is the the same kind of case
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not perfect so there's uh
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
i believe 11 in with the component
 
00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.710 align:start position:0%
i believe 11 in with the component
method

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
and three
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
with the alternative component method
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
which was the best that i could do but
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that this way
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
a better way to be able to give those
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
towns their own
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
districts and thus their own
 
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:36.470 align:start position:0%
districts and thus their own
representatives

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
so mr andrews this is the methodology
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
that was used for the maps that were
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
presented at the public input session on
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
last it was last week
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
i i believe so yes
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
we we had a map of each so we we've done
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
a map with the component method versus a
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
map without with the alternative
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
component method okay and at the public
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
input sessions we've discussed the fact
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
available a website for this committee
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
that website has links for providing
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
direct written comment and including
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
uploading of certain material
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
i have not looked at it in the last 24
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
hours i will admit but some maps have
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
been uploaded so you understand that the
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
potential is there for the actual input
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
of maps yes okay
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
do you know whether this methodology has
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
ever been discussed or used before
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
i believe i am the first person to come
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
up with it so
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay questions for mr andrews
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh again thank you
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify a little bit more
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
about what a necessary
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
versus an unnecessary violation is just
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
sure yeah
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so in the case of my town of
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
chichester it's surrounded by pembroke
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh epsom
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh pittsfield and loudoun all of which
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
are over the 3444
 
01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:08.870 align:start position:0%
are over the 3444
and

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
therefore all those towns should get
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative and district but since
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
chichester is too small to have its own
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
it would need to be combined with one of
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
those other towns and so the new
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution says that towns
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
shall have their own
 
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:29.790 align:start position:0%
district if possible but it shall not
 
01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
district if possible but it shall not
[Music]

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
interfere with other towns being in one
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial district
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
so you couldn't have a
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
town you couldn't pember couldn't have
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
its own district and then a floaterial
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
with just chichester because chichester
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
would need its own non-floaterial
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
district which is why pembroke and
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
chichester are combined into one
 
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.990 align:start position:0%
chichester are combined into one
district

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
other questions representative barry
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for putting all i
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
know that you've put a lot of work into
 
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.349 align:start position:0%
know that you've put a lot of work into
this

01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's apparent
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's also apparent to me i should have
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
labeled this working session algebra you
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
know 201 because we're way beyond 101.
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
it makes my excel sheet uh looking
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
it makes my excel sheet uh looking
amateurish

01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
amateurish
 
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
amateurish
um

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
has there ever been is there any legal
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
core standing on this has ever been
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
tried in court anywhere i know we have a
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
unique system in new hampshire but we
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
have any sort of legal backing for this
 
01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.870 align:start position:0%
have any sort of legal backing for this
process

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that this has been uh
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
brought before any court
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court is the
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
put forth the component method as a
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
method that would work for calculating
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
flow terials
 
01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
but they really emphasize the point that
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
floaterial deviation should be factored
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
in so if you go through and read the
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
burling v chandler it
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
it emphasizes the fact that the
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
aggregate method doesn't factor in
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
floateral deviation at all
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
and then and then
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
talks about how you need to factor in
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
the floateral deviation and the
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
alternative component method does factor
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
in floaterial deviation it just also
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
factors in the deviation of the
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial districts
 
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.829 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial districts
representative

01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
turcotte thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
for your presentation um
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
on the sec
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
can i guess the second to last page of
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
what we just went over where you have
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
any necessarily but necessary violations
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
and unnecessarily
 
01:03:29.359 --> 01:03:30.630 align:start position:0%
and unnecessarily
um

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
i would have liked to seen a column at
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
the end of that
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
that kind of outlined the maximum
 
01:03:36.559 --> 01:03:37.829 align:start position:0%
that kind of outlined the maximum
deviations

01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
deviations
 
01:03:37.839 --> 01:03:40.470 align:start position:0%
deviations
because

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
for my
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
reading of this i don't know if you've
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
ever had the opportunity
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
redistricting law
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
there's an obvious
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
i guess what we could call a tension
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
between u.s constitutional law and new
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitutional law as
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
regarding deviations i'm
 
01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.670 align:start position:0%
regarding deviations i'm
assuming

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
that under your alternative
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
component method that the maximum
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
deviations even though they're what you
 
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.750 align:start position:0%
deviations even though they're what you
call

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
necessary unnecessary violations are
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
reduced that the maximum deviations
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
what other constitutional law may
 
01:04:22.319 --> 01:04:23.430 align:start position:0%
what other constitutional law may
prohibit

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
with all of these i used the plus or
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
minus five percent deviation which is i
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
think generally accepted by by courts
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
around the country as uh
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
acceptable deviation um
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
both the component method and the
 
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.190 align:start position:0%
both the component method and the
alternative

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
component method use that same plus or
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
minus five percent it's just that
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
the alternative component method also
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
factors in the deviation of the
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial districts and in doing so
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
other questions representative smith
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
steve smith
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
so i was looking at the hillsborough
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
maps that you have here
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
it looks like you create a lot more and
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
larger fluterials
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
and then i flip back a page and on
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
merrimack under your method
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
that is a big honking flaterial uh
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
on the top left so is that what happens
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
to make the math come out right
 
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
to make the math come out right
yeah

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
just create way bigger districts
 
01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.029 align:start position:0%
just create way bigger districts
it's

01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
so what it kind of does is it reduces
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the overall size of the
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
regular in general
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
the regular districts but the
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
floaterials are generally
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm writing represent
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
but isn't it also possible because i'm
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
looking at my own county and there isn't
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
a map with it but in my own county
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh what you've stated is that we go to
 
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.910 align:start position:0%
uh what you've stated is that we go to
um

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.190 align:start position:0%
um
zero

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
violations

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
violations
 
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.510 align:start position:0%
violations
but

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
as my county stands now
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
although we don't have huge floateral
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
districts my own district is four towns
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
three representatives three towns that
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
have that should have had their own
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative and to get from one end
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
to the other you go through the next
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
state if you want to go quickly
 
01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
state if you want to go quickly
so

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.390 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
is it not possible that the large
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
floaterials versus large underlying
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
district may be specific county to
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
county and not necessarily
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
endemic to this particular program
 
01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.470 align:start position:0%
endemic to this particular program
in

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
i was just speaking in generality some
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
do uh
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
the the the real thing is that you it's
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
a it's a trade-off in that um you get
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
larger flow materials but the other
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
districts are a lot smaller
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
it actually allows so
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
yes you break up uh you give towns that
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
have the sufficient population their own
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
districts but then also the smaller
 
01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
towns can be put together uh more
 
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.789 align:start position:0%
towns can be put together uh more
compactly

01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
compactly
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
and then oh and then you'll you would
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
overlying floaterial district there but
 
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
it does allow for more kind of compact
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial districts but then larger
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
kind of floateral districts
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative webber
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up so would it be possible for
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
you to uh perhaps produce and send to us
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
a comparison
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
of how many
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
representatives are in the underlying
 
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
representatives are in the underlying
district

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
in your iteration
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
versus how many representatives
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
represent floaterials
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a comparison to that to the
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
status quo we can always find that in
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
any case that doesn't matter but i i one
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
i for myself that chart would be very
 
01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
i for myself that chart would be very
helpful

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.549 align:start position:0%
helpful
because

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
large floaterials as we have heard are
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
not very helpful to people but if the
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
trade-off were a lot more
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
smaller in local districts i think that
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
a lot more people might feel differently
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
about the large flow tarials and as you
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
say it's a trade-off but it would be
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
lovely to see the numbers on that if you
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
could generate them without too much
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
mr andrews going to the
 
01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.309 align:start position:0%
mr andrews going to the
the

01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
comparison between the methodology on
 
01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.630 align:start position:0%
comparison between the methodology on
uh

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
your your numerical column page um could
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
you please tell me what you consider a
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
violation is and then your ranking of
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
what a net necessary violation is
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
yep so just a violation would be
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
a town that has uh 3444 or over that i
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
was not that i was not able to give its
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
own district um and then
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
i get the necessary violations are just
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
ones that um
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
you're you are going to violate the
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
constitution one way or the other when
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
you do it either a town
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't get its own district that should
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
or a town doesn't get their doesn't get
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm giving people a minute to look
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
may i sure can i just want to make sure
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm understanding what
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
am i understanding that when you say
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
that your alternative method takes into
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
consideration the deviations in the
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
non-floaterial districts
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
and my understanding though just to sort
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
of use simple examples
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
if let's say that the ideal district was
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
3 000 as opposed to something more than
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
just for to make it easy so you would
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
say if i'm understanding correctly that
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
well if a town has
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
let's say a population of 4 000 people
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
we could we could instead of saying that
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:10:28.159 --> 01:10:29.350 align:start position:0%
the the
the

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
the population if you will that would be
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
assigned to the floaterial is one
 
01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
assigned to the floaterial is one
thousand

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
we could actually because because a five
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
percent deviation is allowed
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
we could say instead of saying that that
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the underlying district
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the non-filtering district will
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
consist of three thousand people we can
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
make it three thousand minus five
 
01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
make it three thousand minus five
percent

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:55.270 align:start position:0%
and then
uh

01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
assign that those extra numbers to the
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
flow tyria
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
exactly is that exactly correct yeah
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's exactly correct
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
any other further questions for mr
 
01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.030 align:start position:0%
any other further questions for mr
andrews

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
every time you tell me about it i think
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
i understand it and then i think about
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
it later in the day and i don't
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
understand it anymore everyone
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
everyone tells me that
 
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.830 align:start position:0%
everyone tells me that
okay

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
mr anders you've also given us another
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
handout of the project itself which is
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
not really completely relevant to what
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
we're here on the agenda for if you want
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
to submit that online
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
provisions

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
button click on the on the website
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
please go ahead and and then and it's
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
and that way it will be on there for
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
information and
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know thank you for providing it to
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
the committee members
um

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions from mr andrews who
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
i want to thank for coming and arranging
 
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
i want to thank for coming and arranging
this

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that you'd be happy to have
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
people reach out to you if they have
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
what you've presented i certainly
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it and
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
i look forward to seeing you at a public
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
input session
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
so to con continue the math of the day
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
um we have to deal with representatives
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
and cities
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
as we move forward um representative
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
bergeron has kindly provided us with
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
another update of the status
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
so if he just wants to run through that
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
um but i think we can for purposes of
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion we're about to hear
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
understand that cities are not going to
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
have things set until
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
january which will be over a month after
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
we have a bill to report out of this
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee so representative bergeron
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
um and and i think the chair summarized
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much the position that we are in
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh rochester appears to be the only
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
community the only city in the state
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
that may have
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh its ward lines done before november
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
18th they're on track to take a vote on
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
november 3rd
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
all the other cities it will occur after
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
their city elections this fall
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
some have to go through a charter
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
amendment process and may or may not
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
choose to do so i haven't heard yet what
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
claremont's intent is
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
some cities like dover and keene are
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
trying to amend their charter in the
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
november election to allow them then to
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
do redistricting by ordinance
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
if that question fails in one or both of
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
the cities they then have to start the
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
whole charter amendment process in order
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
to redo their lines um
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
for purposes of redistricting
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
i mean we could make the assumption that
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh all the cities are going to do it and
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it correctly and
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
they'll be a very small deviation when
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's done but it's it's a risky
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
assumption to make
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
as we're working with maps some cities
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
on their own if you will within their
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
own boundaries for all the reps they
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
might be entitled to for example concord
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh has ten wards they may be entitled to
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh 13 state representatives they could
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically elect one from each ward
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then three city-wide
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
but it may be that neighboring towns
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
need to pair up with the ward in concord
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
in order to make their numbers work
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i i don't have a suggestion or any
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this other than to say that
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
the cities are not going to have the
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
numbers you need uh prior to november
 
01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.510 align:start position:0%
numbers you need uh prior to november
18th

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
18th
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i just i just had one quick
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
question about the city of
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh never mind i'm sorry i i misread the
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
chart so i don't have a question at all
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
um yes ma'am shimmering
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes the city
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
warrants from what i've seen um
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
is that some of these cities are off by
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
um i know in my home city you mean with
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
the current with the current the current
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
with the current ward lines um i know in
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
my city of manchester ward 12 which is
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
our most northwesterly ward
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
has over 10 000 people now
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
and there's another ward and it's
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
escaping me right now has barely over
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
nine thousand
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
and that's a massive deviation
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
it makes it to where when you're drawing
 
01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:41.669 align:start position:0%
it makes it to where when you're drawing
lines

01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's actually hard to represent
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the wards and the city as a whole
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
because they're not equal within each
 
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.950 align:start position:0%
because they're not equal within each
other

01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
one of the wards in manchester would
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for its own
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
while others would be have to be an
 
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.750 align:start position:0%
while others would be have to be an
afloat

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
afloat
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
these these cities have to get on this
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
they have to do this and they need to
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
draw these lines
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
as nearly perfect as possible it makes
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
our job a lot easier when they do that
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
but they need to they need to get moving
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't know but i think we
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
i want to say thank you to
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron but
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
for all of his hard work this is a
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
massive undertaking um but i i think we
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to we have to let these cities know
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
that they need to get going
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron um i would just
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
clarify that a number of the cities were
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
waiting to the release of the new data
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
files on september 30th which actually
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
just came out a few days ago
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be sure that the
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
they had software or materials and data
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
files that they could work with
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
effectively manchester 10 years ago for
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
example did their redistricting down to
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood level you have a series
 
01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood level you have a series
of

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
of you have a census track a census
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
block and and then neighborhood levels
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
and they were able to keep their range
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
of deviation within one percent i
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe dover did about the same thing
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
so they wanted to make sure that the
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
files they were getting were usable and
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
they found that the ones that were
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
released earlier
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
left a lot to be desired so they
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand their need
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's just that their timelines are
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
different than ours in terms of data
 
01:17:15.199 --> 01:17:16.470 align:start position:0%
different than ours in terms of data
release

01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
release
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
charter amendment processes and
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
timelines and
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
and there's just a lot that they're
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with as well
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i'd like to
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate what representative barry said
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
looking at concord you can't even assume
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
one per ward plus three and a float
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
because the numbers are so bad it the d
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
some of the awards in
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
concord are 1500 people
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
more populous than the smallest award
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that just i mean that
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
you can't even do a simple-minded
 
01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
you can't even do a simple-minded
approach

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
approach
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
such as one per award plus terena float
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
it that that blows the deviations right
 
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
it that that blows the deviations right
there

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
plus as
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
you can't just assume concord is 13 reps
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
and work around it because
 
01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.189 align:start position:0%
and work around it because
that

01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh causes problems with a number of the
 
01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.550 align:start position:0%
uh causes problems with a number of the
towns

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have to assume
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
the cities will do their duties
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate way because
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
we don't really care where the ward
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
lines are as long as the populations are
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
equal and that we know what where where
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the contingent
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcguire my
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not from a city so i guess i'm
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
going to look to representative bergeron
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
can it be fair to assume that like a
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
city like
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
manchester or merrimack even though
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're undergoing a revision are going
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
to probably keep the same number of
 
01:18:54.239 --> 01:18:56.390 align:start position:0%
to probably keep the same number of
wards

01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
wards
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes because the number of wards are
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
determined by their city charters they
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
amend the city charter to change the
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
number of wards
 
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
number of wards
okay

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:06.790 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
there are are there one or two cities
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
who are thinking about getting rid of
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
their awards
 
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
their awards
um

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
berlin does not have wards okay so
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's the city and i heard that
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
franklin might also be looking to get
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
rid of its awards okay so if we
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
assumed that the cities did the right
 
01:19:27.199 --> 01:19:29.270 align:start position:0%
assumed that the cities did the right
thing

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
our base math should be consistent
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
even if our lines have changed
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's hopeful to assume
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the uh cities will keep their
 
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
population deviations within a range of
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
10 percent as they're doing their
 
01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.390 align:start position:0%
10 percent as they're doing their
redistricting

01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are currently out there
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
obviously are skewed i know in nashua
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
for example the southwestern ward has
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
had a lot of
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
residential development so its
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
population is going to be much higher
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
than perhaps another part of the city in
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
terms of increases so that's got to be
 
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
terms of increases so that's got to be
corrected

01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's also one other thing i would
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
note i noticed in the case of nashua
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
that the census tract boundaries did not
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
adhere to ward lines
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
so if we're looking at census tract
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
numbers we can't necessarily assume that
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
those are true representations of what
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
the actual population numbers are in the
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
wards that those tracks sort of fall in
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
in other words they're overlapping ward
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
boundaries and the cities will have to
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
dig down to the
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
block level or even neighborhood level
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
to figure out uh where to plus and minus
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
some of the population numbers
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
all right representative barry
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
someone general i want to point out this
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
this is a a big a big problem for
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons
 
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons
the

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
if we draw our state rep lines based
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
upon the current lines as they are today
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then the cities go
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
and redistribute their population
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately as they should
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
our lines will then be out of whack they
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
will be out of balance
 
01:21:08.639 --> 01:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
will be out of balance
conversely

01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't redistrict them there's
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to be equal protection arguments
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
made on the municipal level
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
if i'm a ward 12 voter in manchester and
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
my ward lines don't change i'm suing
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
because i'm being underrepresented in
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
city hall
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
so we have to as a committee
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
come to some sort of consensus or action
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
as to what to do
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
with these cities that are so far
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
deviated from the ideal that it makes it
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
impossible to do our job we are in a
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
catch-22 situation right if we draw it
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
as they are now and they change we draw
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
on constitutional maps
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
we have to assume or my opinion we need
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
to assume that they're going to do their
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
job in time they're going to keep the
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
same number of ward lines which as
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron said i don't
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
believe anybody has any intention of
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
changing that
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
because it's in their charter but we
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
have to kind of set our course that in
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion that they're going to do the
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
right thing
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
and if we don't do that we will draw
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
by default we will draw maps that will
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and it's kind of a follow-up i
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
mean i really don't see that the
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
alternative of using the current ward
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
lines is an alternative at all because
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
they do have an obligation to equalize
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
their wards as soon as the census data
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
comes out just as everybody else does
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
so i think that the only way we can
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
proceed and certainly the way we
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
proceeded 10 years ago
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
is to figure out
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.390 align:start position:0%
how many
uh

01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
work on that basis for
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know letting them draw the ward
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
lines without our looking at the current
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
numbers because
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things we're pretty sure
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
about is those are gonna those have to
 
01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:11.270 align:start position:0%
about is those are gonna those have to
change

01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.189 align:start position:0%
change
um

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:15.430 align:start position:0%
um
now

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to remember how
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
oh i know how it happened
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
what did happen several times last time
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
one or more awards
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
given their equal number of population
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
were combined with a town outside of the
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
commit city and given
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
more represented representatives as
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
the one keen ward that's joined to
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
the one concord ward that's joined to
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
hopkinton for example and then has three
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
for for all of them
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that is not at all ideal for the
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
cities but
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh i will point out that
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
all of these arguments are somewhat
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
circular because it
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
to combine a city ward with a town that
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
may have very different interests
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
it also when we get to the smaller
 
01:24:15.199 --> 01:24:16.390 align:start position:0%
it also when we get to the smaller
population

01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
counties and regions just as we've
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
already heard
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to put together some
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
groupings that we've put together
 
01:24:26.639 --> 01:24:27.510 align:start position:0%
groupings that we've put together
but

01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
given that there isn't enough population
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
to do it another way you wind up
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
i mean it really is a catch-22 situation
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm arguing for
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out the numbers for
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
each city and then hoping for the best
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber i guess
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
my position would be that we have a
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
number of wards
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
we should continue to use the same
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
number of wards and simply assume
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
the population per ward and the reason
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm putting it like that is because i
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
think that's a programming issue
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i i want the program to be able to
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
be changed to reflect that assumption
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
and then if the city lines change the
 
01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill that comes out of
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
this committee is a lot
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
easier if you're into meets and bounds
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
because then we can just change it for
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
the ward lines to the extent they're
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
specifically in the statutes as compared
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
to redoing maps because now i have a
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
different population that throws the
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to your statement we've
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
never put the ward lines in yeah as soon
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
as i said the numbers we've only seen
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
wards one through seven or one through
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
three that's the lawyer talking the
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
judge hoping the judge has his head down
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
and didn't really hear what you said and
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
just moved on to your next point
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else on
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
on this oh sorry representative wilhelm
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
i think there's an assumption here that
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
the award
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
the awards are going to largely stay the
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
same and that the lines would just move
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
to adjust for population so well i think
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
the point is some of the awards as they
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
even existed last time
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
are so far skewed for equal population
 
01:26:22.239 --> 01:26:23.110 align:start position:0%
are so far skewed for equal population
that

01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some change but i
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
think as representative weber said to me
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
in a conversation earlier this morning i
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
think we're all trying to say the same
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
thing slightly differently but i guess
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
my point in having this discussion is
 
01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:36.149 align:start position:0%
my point in having this discussion is
that

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
i need something done because the
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
program that is out there now
 
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.149 align:start position:0%
program that is out there now
has

01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't match to anything that we're
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
talking about right now representative
 
01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
talking about right now representative
mcguire

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you regarding your point
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm it doesn't matter
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's ward 5
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
exactly that's going adjacent to
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
hopkinton we know that the city of
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
concord touches
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
the town of hopkinton
 
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.510 align:start position:0%
the town of hopkinton
and

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that you know if we say
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the war the westernmost ward
 
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:09.110 align:start position:0%
that the war the westernmost ward
is

01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
is in the district
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
they probably will make the number the
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
same but they've got to have a ward that
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
touches hopkinton there's just no way
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
it so long as it's contiguous right i
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's the right assumption
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
that we're making we're not moving the
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
city boundaries at all so all the towns
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
that currently touch the city do touch
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
the city right
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative i'm just is there a
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
deadline for
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
cities to do their redistricting well if
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the handout the reality is
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's we're not going to be really
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
getting numbers until january
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
well and so i wonder
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i know that we're trying to get
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
should we explore the possibility of
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
waiting until we've got the
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
the city data back and
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
the chair would not entertain such a
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
motion because the issue is is that
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
we as a body have certain obligations
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
and we will be voting on things in
 
01:28:05.679 --> 01:28:07.270 align:start position:0%
and we will be voting on things in
january

01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
january
 
01:28:08.790 --> 01:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
even if the cities all take care of
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
everything in january first
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
which i don't anticipate will be done i
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't know when our first session is to
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
redo boundaries so the process is this
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill will come forward in the house
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
and people who have been on this
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee before can add to it but i
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
know that bills will come that come out
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
and are voted on by the house in january
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
we'll be going to the senate so if there
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
are further amendments or changes that
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
need to be made both houses will have
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
both chambers will have an opportunity
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not remembering precisely but i do
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
remember that we had this timing issue
 
01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.790 align:start position:0%
remember that we had this timing issue
before

01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
we did of course get the census numbers
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
far earlier last time
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that we may have
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
even had a rules
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
suspension with respect to the work
 
01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.990 align:start position:0%
suspension with respect to the work
because

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
it would it would it is necessary to
 
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
it would it would it is necessary to
have

01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
all of the data to produce
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
a proper
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh thing so that might be something one
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
and i had a further
 
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
thought that has now escaped me
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the the other thing to bear in mind is
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh just the issue that we have heard
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
very clearly from
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh the folks who have come to our
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
listening sessions so far
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
that they would very much like an
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the same kind of
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
commentary on maps once maps are issued
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
if there were to be a rule suspension
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would allow
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
for more deliberate comment from folks
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
on actual maps i know all of that's
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
difficult and i'm just i'm just putting
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
that out there
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes thank you
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair i agree with representative
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
weber that we do not want to
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
delay the issuance of maps because the
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
public has strongly said they want to
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
comment on them if we as if we
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not willing to give up anything
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
unless the wards are appropriate so even
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
if there is a
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
some some tweaks later we still want to
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
say okay the cities have been done their
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
job properly we have equalized wards
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
this is a plan that we're presenting for
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
public comment
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
and and i think that we want to do that
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong i think the
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
place we're trying to get to
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
is establishing a policy of how we're
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
going to do the work because if we
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
assume that the awards are equalized our
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
software needs to be updated and we use
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
the software for two things to create
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
maps ourselves and to evaluate other
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
maps that are brought to us
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
i would not like to have a lot of hours
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
of work into that
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
the way it stands now because it does
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
have the the unequalized wards so
 
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and in the past what we did to avoid
 
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
and in the past what we did to avoid
well

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know who had access to the
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
software last time around because i
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't but
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that what we did
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
the last time around was we just
 
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
left a black hole for the cities
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
and did not
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
try and force the current numbers that
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have on the cities into the plan
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
we just left sort of a black hole for
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
the cities
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
which meant that you didn't have to
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
correct for all of the
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
all of the data we just we just
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
allocated x number to the city and and
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
worked around that until we got to the
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
very end
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not sure i understand how
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
that works because in order for you to
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
do that work
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
in that way
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
every city would have to be within an
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
acceptable deviation a perfect
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
population and i don't believe that's
 
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:19.430 align:start position:0%
population and i don't believe that's
true

01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to get to the point where i
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
can actually finish the county and move
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
on can you clarify how that worked for
 
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.550 align:start position:0%
on can you clarify how that worked for
me

01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right well all i know that i thought
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
i was in an algebra class and then i
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
heard about black holes and now i'm in
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
astronomy so i think it's almost time
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
much like my comments on the uh
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about the numbers
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to use the 400 uh it's
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
the same thing as representative steve
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
smith has just said in order to get
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
going on our work we need to know those
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
numbers attempting to draw
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
these districts
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
with the wards as unbalanced as they are
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
i've run into that in several counties
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
basically spinning spinning wheels the
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
other concern i have it's been mentioned
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe waiting is uh
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know for the
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
cities and town or the cities to do
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
their their work to me waiting is not an
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
option um
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally or
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
unintentionally having uh
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
a city or a couple cities delayed the
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
process that we're trying to get
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
accomplished to me is not an option so i
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
think we need to make a decision uh one
 
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
way or the other on how we are going to
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
treat those
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
cities with wards
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
chair um i believe representatives smith
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
weber and turcotte are pretty much all
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
on the same page and i i would
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
second with representative weber said uh
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
10 years ago i was city clerk in nashua
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
and had conversations with
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative allen court who was
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
assisting and redistricting back then
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
and his direction to me was nashua
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
should just go ahead with its
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
redistricting process stay within the
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
range of deviation and the state would
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
take care of the assignment of uh um
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate state rep seats or districts
 
01:34:13.199 --> 01:34:13.990 align:start position:0%
appropriate state rep seats or districts
and

01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i think what
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing most people saying and i
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
apologize if i'm putting words in their
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
mouths is that we essentially
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
city x is going to get so many state
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
representatives let them do their uh and
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
make the assumption that if in the case
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
of nashua we have 90 000 residents nine
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
wards and that nashville will put 10 000
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
residents in each of those wards and so
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
for purposes of our software we just
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
look at the number of wars the city has
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
divided by the
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
number of uh the into the population and
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's the number we put into our
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
software as being the population for
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
each of the wards regardless of what it
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
is actually now that that's the goal for
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
what it should be after redistricting is
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
to repeat what representative burgess i
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
think that's the way we have to go
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
forward is we have to assume that these
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
cities are going to do their job i think
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
we have to assume that they're going to
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
do a near perfect job i think we have to
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
as he said take you know in manchester
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
we have 12 awards 115 000 people 115 000
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
divided by 12 distribute that over the
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
different wards put that in the software
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
and draw our lines based off of that
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be the process
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
i think we have to follow i don't see
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
another path that doesn't end up with us
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
getting maps tossed out
 
01:35:34.719 --> 01:35:35.910 align:start position:0%
getting maps tossed out
representative

01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and and to follow up on all of
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
that and also to circle back to
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative stephen smith's question
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
if we take the approach that was just
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
set out
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
we know what the deviation both in
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
population and in percentage is in the
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
allocation made to the city
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we can take into account
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
that deviation when we're thinking about
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
what combinations we might want to make
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
or not want to make outside of the city
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
just as as
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm explained it
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter exactly where the lot
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
line is if you know you have one equal
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
slice of the pie plus a particular
 
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.350 align:start position:0%
slice of the pie plus a particular
deviation

01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
you can then work out what you do with
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
it to fix
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers overall
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i think we've sort of
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're actually sort of as a committee
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
all agreeing that we're all saying the
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
same thing which i still can't quite
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
figure out but if we're there we're
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
there representative mcguire
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
in full agreement with what's been said
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
i move that the
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
the chair direct our
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
our staff to
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
assign equal numbers of population to
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
each ward in each city
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can proceed with our mapping
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
and that we send a letter to the cities
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
telling that we are assuming they will
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
do their job
 
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.229 align:start position:0%
do their job
appropriately

01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
been seconded by representative turcotte
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.470 align:start position:0%
is there any
further

01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i i just like
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
clarification on uh
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
rep bergeron's chart where uh regarding
 
01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
rep bergeron's chart where uh regarding
franklin

01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
what are we
 
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.390 align:start position:0%
what are we
assuming

01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
there are we assuming the districts
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
remain are we
 
01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:39.990 align:start position:0%
remain are we
um

01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
because it
 
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.830 align:start position:0%
because it
could

01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
make a difference all right
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
so i'd just like to have that clarified
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think we need to treat every city the
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
same at this time my understanding is
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
franklin at least from what maybe
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron can expound on
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is they're requesting they're
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
leaving their ward lines but they're
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
requesting to be treated as one
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's legal because we
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
have uh i mean that's my posit my
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
position is we need to treat every city
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
the same at this point which is what
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
legally exists because
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have a standard of political
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
subdivision and that's a political
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
subdivision that exists inside the city
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
of franklin
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
yes if they if they succeed in
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
eliminating their award lines that's one
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
thing but as long as they have them we
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
have to assume that all three awards
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
have the same population and that might
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
require a little more adjustment
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards depending on what they're
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
doing but i think as we proceed
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
everything at least it's my hope it's
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
treated the same representative marjorie
 
01:38:37.199 --> 01:38:38.470 align:start position:0%
treated the same representative marjorie
smith

01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
smith
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
could you help me
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
understand how we would handle the
 
01:38:46.159 --> 01:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
understand how we would handle the
situation

01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
such as
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
the one that we have in dover and
 
01:38:52.719 --> 01:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
the one that we have in dover and
hopkinton

01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
hopkinton
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's a similar situation i mean
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
concord and hopkins is a similar
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
situation with dover and
 
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.350 align:start position:0%
situation with dover and
somersworth

01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
somersworth
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
or rollinsford
 
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.790 align:start position:0%
or rollinsford
um

01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
where we have to bring in a town in
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
order to help make these numbers work
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
make it more or less difficult
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
for us to do that
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
this is not a rhetorical question i
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
really don't understand
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
and wonder how that would be handled
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes thank you
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
it would make such a a process easier
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh rollins ford hat is worth three
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
quarters of a rep and therefore it needs
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
to be joined within an
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
adjacent town it is on
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
it is actually only adjacent to the two
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
cities of somersworth and dover so it
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be attached to some
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
section of them and knowing what the
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
population of the awards are
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
will make it much easier to do an
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate redistricting in that area
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative barry um i just want a
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
second what representative mcguire says
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
i just said i take one issue with the
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
word i don't know if easier or harder is
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
the right word i think accurate would be
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
the right word thank you
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
connection representative glenn i just
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
asked one question uh there were in if i
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
understood correctly from the discussion
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
there are some cities that have
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
at large they had in other words they
 
01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
have wards and they also have an
 
01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
have wards and they also have an
at-large

01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
at-large
 
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.270 align:start position:0%
at-large
uh

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
a ward that consists of an at-large in
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
other words the whole city is that
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
correct that might have to do with the
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
city government representative bergeron
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
i know that claremont is an example of
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
that they have four state
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
representatives currently they have
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
three wards so they elect uh one from
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
each of the wards and one city-wide
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be an at large and i guess
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
my only question is how does that what
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
is the impact of that on what we have to
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
do that's why you open your program and
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
figure out where the reps are
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative lynn for asking that
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
question because it's the best example
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
of why this needs to be done
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
claremont lost a boatload of people out
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
of ward 3 which created a massive
 
01:41:26.639 --> 01:41:27.910 align:start position:0%
of ward 3 which created a massive
deviation

01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
between that warden wards 1 and 2.
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
when you give each of the three wards
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
its own representative and then create
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
the city-wide fleterial when they're
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
equalized the deviation is about 3.3
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
without doing that the deviation is just
 
01:41:44.239 --> 01:41:45.109 align:start position:0%
without doing that the deviation is just
under

01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
plus 10 all by itself
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
because of the geography of the county
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are necessary deviations that are
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
negative 3 to negative 5.
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
so if we don't do this clermont needs to
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
be ripped up and up the wards combined
 
01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:01.510 align:start position:0%
be ripped up and up the wards combined
with

01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
towns in order to create legal districts
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want that and i don't
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
think anybody does so that's why we need
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the motion i'm
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none so i'm going to ask the
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%

unanimous madam chairman thank you thank
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
you to committee members we will do that
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
um so what i will be looking for is
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
for staff to make arrangements for an
 
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
for staff to make arrangements for an
updated

01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
updated
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
programs for you to use
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
i will ask them about the possibility of
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
producing something alternative to a
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
thumb drive i have no idea about the
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
ability to do that
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
and you will and what i would like to do
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
is to have an email sent to you when
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
they are ready so you can then respond
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
to let us know whether you want it
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
mailed or picked or you will be picking
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
it up because you're here on other
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislative business
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
we had an instance where thumb drive was
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
mailed and it didn't get to where it was
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to go so
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
if people are available to pick it up
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
and would rather do that i want to do
 
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.229 align:start position:0%
and would rather do that i want to do
that

01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
we do have county listening sessions
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
dates set up for all but two counties
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
tonight needed to be canceled because it
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be rescheduled
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
and the rescheduling is requiring a
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
location change which we are working on
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
belknap i believe has been tentatively
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the 19th but there's some
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
administrative um things to make sure
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
that we can secure the location which is
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
proposed to be the mills
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
and as soon as that is definite you will
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
be informed so we will be having
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
listening sessions through
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
mid-october which was i think the stated
 
01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.350 align:start position:0%
mid-october which was i think the stated
goal

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
goal

at the beginning of those sessions

01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
marjorie smith
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair and i would like to also
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
having to jump through incredible number
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
of hoops
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
to get the 10
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
listening sessions set up and i know it
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't easy and i know the burden for
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
that fell on the house and i
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
particularly want to thank you for that
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
now i mean don't want to get you annoyed
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
because i really do appreciate all that
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
you've done but i also
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
would like us to find a time sooner
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
rather than later
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
when we might talk about other factors
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we believe are essential if we are
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
going to do the best job that we can
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
possibly do
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
i alluded to one earlier
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
based i think on incredibly strong and
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
persuasive testimony that we heard in
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
the three counties and that had to do
 
01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.189 align:start position:0%
the three counties and that had to do
with

01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
when we moved to combine towns
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we consider
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
i think the euphemism is communities of
 
01:45:47.679 --> 01:45:48.950 align:start position:0%
i think the euphemism is communities of
interest

01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
but one in particular to me stood out
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that was school districts
 
01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.790 align:start position:0%
and that was school districts
and

01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would hope that we might want to uh
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
and that would be probably high school
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
districts rather than
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know the local elementary schools
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
i i hope that we might give some
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
consideration to including that in our
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
decision making
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how you might want to
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
proceed about that and again i am
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
serious in thanking you for the
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
incredible work that you've done
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your kind
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
comments and thank you
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
to representative smith she is one of
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
the representatives that has attended
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
all the public input sessions so far
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
along with a couple of other members um
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you to for that um it is my
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
hope that we we just had a fairly long
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
discussion on a pretty a couple of
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
pretty specific things
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
um the number of representatives and
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
allocating population in a city
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
um it is my hope that if we have
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
discussions about
 
01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.390 align:start position:0%
discussions about
non-legislated

01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
parameters for districting that it's
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
done with the preparation with the
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
presentation of maps
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
i will tell you as chair i am not really
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
particularly well i am i am having
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
public input sessions to hear input
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
about things but i think ultimately this
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee needs to get to what its task
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
is which is looking at maps so what i i
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
would expect that if people are
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
various factors such as school districts
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
that i would see that in the
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
presentation of maps to the committee
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
for review
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
by other committee members so
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll be scheduling meetings as soon
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
as i have some sort of a schedule
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
of course it will be put on the website
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
and committee members will be informed i
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
have november 18th at the end of our
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
agenda because that is indeed the date i
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
understand is the report out date
 
01:47:51.679 --> 01:47:52.470 align:start position:0%
understand is the report out date
so

01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
we will be proceeding on that and i look
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
forward to everybody's discussion while
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at maps on those other
 
01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.550 align:start position:0%
we're looking at maps on those other
parameters

01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's all i had for today's meeting is
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
there any other business that people
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
would like to bring i saw somebody point
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
across the table so i'm going over here
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you at least at the meetings
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
that i've attended thus far it's
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
apparent that people want
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
more meetings once we agree on a map and
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
should we start
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
scheduling those or do we wait until we
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
have a map and then schedule them i
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
don't know we'll
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have to may i'll have to make that
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
decision because um as you may know from
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
attending those when i make decisions it
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
seems like the senate then makes
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
decisions so um i i need to figure out
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
that may i follow up sure without
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
getting the other side of the wall mad
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
at me these are our hearings that we're
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling and if they need them to
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
schedule their own then i would suggest
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
politely that they may want to do so i i
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand that but i will also tell
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
people that we have been at a public
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
hearing where somebody said insisted
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
that we should be going to every town
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
um with a map
 
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.629 align:start position:0%
um with a map
so

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
i say that so we can all keep in mind
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a big spectrum of
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
what people think is fair appropriate
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
and should go forward what i know needs
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
to go forward are maps so i'm hoping
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to start getting to that
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
pretty soon i want to thank you all for
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
coming today i want to thank mr anders
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
for coming and sticking through the rest
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
of our meeting after he was on the
 
01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.709 align:start position:0%
of our meeting after he was on the
agenda

01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:58.719 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
you
