you madam chair
 
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
um

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
this is not a new amendment in the sense
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
that it has been circulated in its
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
present form since november of last year
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
it is the amendment that the minority
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
proposed to house bill 52
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
and has
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
been in the public arena for discussion
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
and for comment for some time
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
we're reintroducing it because we do
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe that it has the uh it proposes
 
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
districts that are competitive and that
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
minimally disruptive to the current
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
forms of the congressional districts as
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
well as disruptive to the residents who
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
live within those districts
 
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
currently the population based on the
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
2020 census
 
00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.749 align:start position:0%
2020 census
has

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
congressional district 1 with 17
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
945 people
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
more than congressional district 2
 
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
more than congressional district 2
contains

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
contains
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
by moving the town of hampstead from
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
congressional district 1 to 2
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
that changes the
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
population deviation to just 51 people
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
between the two districts
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed in the past there has
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
been over
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
at least since 1880 based on on the maps
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
that were distributed to us
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
there has been minor changes made to
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
congressional districts one and two uh
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
with each
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
decennial census and we are proposing to
 
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
continue that process and simply move
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
one town in order to bring the two
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
congressional districts within a
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
suitable range of deviation
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
further discussion or
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on the amendment
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
just before i recognize representative
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
barry uh representative bergeron you you
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
gave us the numbers for the deviation
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it's helpful to have
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
that on the record what is the
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
competitive measurement that you
 
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.749 align:start position:0%
competitive measurement that you
had

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
i do not have that in my notes okay i
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know i can say that uh
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
historically in the second district
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
republicans have won 71 times in the
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
last 86 elections
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
and uh over the last eight elections the
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
first district has changed six times
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
with the incumbent losing five of those
 
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.670 align:start position:0%
with the incumbent losing five of those
races

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
races
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
and as so one
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
one member of this committee has
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the past results kind of
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative barry yes um if uh the
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative will take a question
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
sure if i can answer it be happy please
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
do you consider this the least change
 
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.110 align:start position:0%
do you consider this the least change
method

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.830 align:start position:0%
i do
um

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow it's more of a statement than a
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up it's an executive session um
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
um there's actually a way to move less
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
people and get a lower deviation um
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
you're moving one town but you're moving
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
one town but you're not near the perfect
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
deviation you could move the towns of
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
campton sandwich albany bartlett hales
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
and hearts from district one to district
 
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.070 align:start position:0%
and hearts from district one to district
2

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
and you would have a deviation of 5
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
people and 4 people
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
and that would actually move less people
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
so you're moving less towns but you're
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
moving more people so what's your
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
definition of least change mind would be
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
moving less people
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
well mine obviously is moving less towns
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
fair enough um follow-up madam chairman
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative barry um the
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned in your speech
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
we've we've basically made eaten around
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
the edges since the last
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
on this map which was came around in
 
00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.870 align:start position:0%
on this map which was came around in
1880

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
1880
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
at what point should the state stop
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
eating around the edges because if the
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
district that was passed in 1880 which
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
by the way was done to suppress the
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
catholic vote
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
if that district that we're basing
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
that your map is based off of this
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
amendment's based off of
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
if that district was around today it
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be off by around 300 000 people so
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
for how long for how many more centuries
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
should we continue to
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
eat around the edges and not just re
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that the population of the
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
state has shifted
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
i would say that we have over the last
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
six months or more looked at a number of
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
different alternatives to creating
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
congressional districts and sometimes
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
after we explore a lot of alternatives
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes it makes sense to go back to
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of the initial proposals and find
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
out that maybe that was the best to
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
begin with uh
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
right from the start that's fair um if i
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
may madam chairman um
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
before i want to go anybody else want to
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
go here
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative barry question or
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
general comments
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes this is just general comment um so i
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
i look at these maps from two
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
perspectives the first of which is
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
what's best for the state overall and
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
what's best for the communities that i
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
represent of manchester and litchfield
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
this map um doesn't keep any communities
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
of interest together other than
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
the seacoast and for months we have
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
heard from our friends on the other side
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
of the aisle about communities of
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
interest and deviation and
 
00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.949 align:start position:0%
interest and deviation and
competitiveness

00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
competitiveness
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
and here we have a map where the
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
minority party is making the only
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
district that has gone back and forth in
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
the last decade
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
less competitive the town of it's no
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's no um coincidence that the town
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
they're moving has to be happens to be
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
ruby red and that they're taking it out
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
of the only district that has been won
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
by the other party in the last 10 years
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
so the competitiveness argument just
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't fly on face value you're
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
actually making the maps less
 
00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:37.350 align:start position:0%
actually making the maps less
competitive

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
the communities of interest argument
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
that your party has pushed for the last
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
six months is completely bankrupt at
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
this point the only
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
community of interest you're keeping
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
together is the
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
seacoast so as a manchester person as a
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
i-93 person which is the center of the
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
state's population why would i support a
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
map that breaks apart my community so
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we can keep things the same as
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
they've always been which they're not
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
because 1880 was 120 years 140 years ago
 
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
because 1880 was 120 years 140 years ago
um

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
and we just keep making things the same
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
and we keep sacrificing every other part
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
of the state has to be sacrificed so
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
that the seacoast can be kept together
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how anybody from the
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
greater manchester area could support
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
this our community is divided litchfield
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
is not in there um i don't underst you
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
know they you they bring forward the
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
let's take a drive you know oh from uh
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
well let's take a drive let's take a
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
drive now you go if you start in salem
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
you go to pittsburgh you're going to
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
switch districts five times
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is ridiculous at what point are we
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
hitting the reset button at what point
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
do we just keep eating around the edges
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
and in 120 years there's somebody like
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
me sitting here saying the same thing
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep eating around the
 
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.150 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep eating around the
edges

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
edges
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
the population has changed it's 300 000
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
people different from what they passed
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
the map that this is based off of no one
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
refutes this was designed to suppress
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the catholic vote
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
for everything that we've heard for all
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
the virtue signaling and the gnashing of
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
teeth and the hair pulling
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's all just bankrupt this map was
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
built to to suppress the catholic vote
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
you're building a map off of a map that
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
was built to suppress the captain vote
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't keep communities of interest
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
together it's it's it's a laughable
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
argument it's not a least change method
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
it can be done by moving towns in the
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
north country i don't know why the north
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
country always gets gets thrown aside
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
but i will not be supporting this for
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons but these things need to
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
be said you know they um they they say
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
you can do whatever you want on your
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
last day and this is the last day of our
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and i'm gonna say it
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry for
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
clarification i just wanted to let the
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee know that i inquired as to
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
what that little leg was that
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
and apparently it's a census block
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
without any population other than clams
 
00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
without any population other than clams
so

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know they haven't come up to the
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
surface to let me know so
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
but that it is very disconcerting when
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
you look at it as to what are we talking
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
about but that is apparently thank you
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
and of course we do not do redistricting
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
by census block but of course the
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
programs include it because the debt
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
because quote the data the the
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
the block is there so representative
 
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.590 align:start position:0%
the block is there so representative
especially

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you manager um no worries i was
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
gonna say i need a i'm representing
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty today
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
and i mean i will be supporting
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 2022 1736 i h i think you
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
know making sure that
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
we keep north the north kind of the
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
interest of the north country in
 
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.030 align:start position:0%
interest of the north country in
um

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
that each district has a little bit of
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
that is important i think when we think
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
about those communities of interest
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's important um i think the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
other you know one of the other things i
 
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.670 align:start position:0%
other you know one of the other things i
i

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
really for voters um
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
is making sure they're not as confused
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know when we make drastic we shift
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
around maps and make drastic changes
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
people for
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
don't realize who their new
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
congressional representative is they
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
might have had previous relationships
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
with them doing constituent services
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
i've done constituent services with my
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
people um with one of the
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
members of the federal delegation and
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
people you know they like to know okay
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is where the office is if i have a
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
case with the va this is where i go and
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
so when you start switching things
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
around and say oh you're no longer under
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know cd1 you're now in cd2 you're
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
gonna start missing out on that so you
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
know i think least change also has has
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
an effect on our voters
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
further comments representative mcguire
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm opposed to this map
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
for a couple of different reasons one is
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
so in the case of merrimack county
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
there is one town that's in cd1 and the
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
rest of us are in cd2
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
which means that
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
we're split we
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
we don't get the coherent advantage
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
of having the county treated as a unit
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
also the cut the idea that the north
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
country is in two districts is i think
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
a little disingenuous i think this north
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
country should be in one district
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
because it is a fairly cohesive
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
community of interest and you'll notice
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
the white mountains are
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
are in cd1 and in coast counties and cd2
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
or most of it
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
so you've got everything split up
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's no i and i would also like to
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
comment to the representative from
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
manchester that my constituents don't
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
seem to know or care who their
 
00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:42.710 align:start position:0%
seem to know or care who their
congressional

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
congressional
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh delegate is
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
they write me letters telling me to vote
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
in congress and when i tell them you
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
have to talk to your congressperson
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
which at the moment is representative
 
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.949 align:start position:0%
which at the moment is representative
custer

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
custer
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
they say who's she
 
00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
they say who's she
they

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
most people are not involved with their
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
federal delegation i have not gotten
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
good constituent service and neither has
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else who's talked to me they
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
have frequently said well
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
my congress person ignores me so i went
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
to the senator and the senators don't
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
care what district you're in they've got
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
the whole state
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
and so i think that unless we have
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
unless we manage to elect
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
representatives who are
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
much better at constituent service
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
than any of the people i've seen
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter who your congress
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
person is
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative marjorie smith
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.389 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
uh

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
barry noted that the original um map of
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
1880 was drawn specifically
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
to discriminate against a particular
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
religious group and
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
i was not aware of that and i thank him
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
very much for sharing
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to take this opportunity to
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
point out that um
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was of course um
 
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.029 align:start position:0%
that was of course um
drawn

00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
drawn
assuming

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
assuming
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
as i i'm sure it's true
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
having to do with catholic males
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
since in 1880
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
no female
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
could vote and in fact for
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
basically another 40 years
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
there were no
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
females at all and that is a group that
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think everybody would agree
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
has some importance in
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
the electoral process in in the current
 
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.830 align:start position:0%
the electoral process in in the current
year

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
um and what
 
00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:48.390 align:start position:0%
um and what
uh

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
my point
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
is that things change
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
and we have to figure out how to address
 
00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.750 align:start position:0%
and we have to figure out how to address
change

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
um i also want to point out that never
 
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.669 align:start position:0%
um i also want to point out that never
never

00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
was any party other than the republican
 
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.549 align:start position:0%
was any party other than the republican
party

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
in charge of drawing
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
district lines for congress
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the executive councils for the new
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate and the new hampshire
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate and the new hampshire
house

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
so that every map
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
that was drawn let's just go from 1881
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
we ended up with two districts before
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
that the districts uh
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
there were three and there were four for
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
other reasons
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
um and those
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
districts that were drawn
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
were drawn by a republican majority
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
that respected the principle that we
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
build on that which
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
has gone before
 
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.050 align:start position:0%
that includes having two major
 
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.150 align:start position:0%
that includes having two major
[Music]

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
supreme court cases
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
that among other things established one
 
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.789 align:start position:0%
that among other things established one
person

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
one vote
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
of course in the vernacular referred to
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
was one man one vote but i'd like to go
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
back to my first point about women
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that each of the
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
republican majorities every 10 years
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
since 1880
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
recognized that the state has been here
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.230 align:start position:0%
for a long time
that

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
things change our population changes the
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
concentration changes
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
but we do not
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
operate from a blank slate we do not go
 
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.430 align:start position:0%
operate from a blank slate we do not go
back

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
and pretend that nothing that has
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
happened before matters and now we're
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to begin again
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
those of us who
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
respect the principles of
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
and i think all of us do but in
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
of a democratic society realizing that
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
the power
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
that we have comes from the people who
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
elect us
 
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that that stability is
 
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
i believe that that stability is
important

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
and i um strongly support this
 
00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:14.230 align:start position:0%
and i um strongly support this
particular

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment which
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
respects that which has gone before
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
respects the republican leadership which
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
we have had
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
for the last 140 years in this state
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
and at the same time understands the
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
changes that have taken place in the
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
population concentration
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
um i also would suggest to you
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
that there are when you talk about
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
communities of interest there are
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
differences in community interest
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
between for example the connecticut
 
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.029 align:start position:0%
between for example the connecticut
valley

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
valley
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
and what you refer to as the seacoast
 
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.870 align:start position:0%
and what you refer to as the seacoast
um

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
but when you look at a map
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
that tries to bring together
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
for reasons that aren't necessarily
 
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.669 align:start position:0%
for reasons that aren't necessarily
obvious

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
the entire western
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
side of the state with the entire
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
eastern side of the state
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
one wonders about
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
this this argument about communities of
 
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.149 align:start position:0%
this this argument about communities of
interest

00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
smith before i take any further comment
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
share with the committee that i went
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
through the exercise of looking at other
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
states that only have two congressmen i
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
think there are four of us
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i would submit to you that we
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
actually have a harder job than the
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
states who have three or four districts
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
because it is more difficult to get
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
lines or groupings that you can get a
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
consensus of agreement on i'd also like
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
to point out to representative smith's
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
comments about changes
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
if you were to do this
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
simply on population and argue that the
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
biggest driver of interest in this state
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
is the southern border because that's
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
certainly where our growth has come come
 
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.390 align:start position:0%
certainly where our growth has come come
from

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
the line for population deviation would
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
not be north of manchester straight
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
across the state it would be visually it
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
would look like about one or two town
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
deep across the bottom so
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to publicly point out that
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
this committee has had a difficult task
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
in a couple of ways representative steve
 
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
in a couple of ways representative steve
smith

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
i know it's stereotypically new england
 
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
to say always done it that way before
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
but i've always rejected that and i've
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of actual harm done by it
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
i live on the vermont border and the
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
giant expanse of cd2
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
i have multiple grievances with the
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
existing districts and and this one as
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't solve any of my problems
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
first of all if you want to talk about
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered we're normally thinking of
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
how do i pack members of political
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
parties into different municipalities
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's another way to do it to protect
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
incumbency look at this map how do you
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
campaign cd2
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're advertising in boston
 
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
the keen sentinel wcax out of burlington
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
wptc out of plattsburgh you're going to
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
have to also do wmur it's an incredibly
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
expensive district
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change it it doesn't solve
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
the problem and i wish it did
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have a road our main thoroughfare on
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
the western border of the state
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
literally sliding into the connecticut
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
river that's not even hyperbole
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
hyperbole it's actually what's happening
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
people there are sick of hearing about
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
i-93 expansion and that's where all the
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
highway dollars are going it doesn't
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
matter what party they're in this is
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
what i hear from people they're not even
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
political people in some cases but they
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
all agree
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
this doesn't help that problem of having
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
a congress person that will help us
 
00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.029 align:start position:0%
a congress person that will help us
focus

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
focus
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
on just the issues with impact to the
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
river and getting that fixed up
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's a mess
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
why don't we just start over when when
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
the 1880 map was done what was the
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
industry i don't know
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
i do know that in the 35 years i lived
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and sullivan county
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
i've seen a change drastically it used
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
to be along the river
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
a major manufacturing area
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
everything from boots to photo albums
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
across the river
 
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.430 align:start position:0%
across the river
gears

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
gears
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
in sunapee we had precision machine
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
which back in the day used to make
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
precision parts for missiles
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
all of that's gone
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
and that's just in the 35 year window
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
that i've had to look so how the heck
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
the decisions that were made over 100
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
years ago when we have that kind of
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
rapid change going to a service economy
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much but how do we let that drive
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
our decisions today
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative berry it's
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
time for a new ground up approach to
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
address not the new hampshire of 1880 or
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
1920 but of the state it is in today
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
so uh this is too much same old same old
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
for me and for that reason alone i
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly support it
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
representative espedeza
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and just to that
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
point i don't you know we're talking
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
about 1920. this map is probably the
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
most similar to 2010 like this is our
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
sorry 2012 when it was when it was done
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about you know i
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
know you brought up the century old 1880
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
shape but we're talking about this map
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
was done 10 years ago similarly and so
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
and and then similarly was done again in
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
2002 it hasn't really changed shape so
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
when we're asking you know folks if
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
they've you know that they've done a bad
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
job with are we saying okay so the last
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
last two times that this has gone
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.350 align:start position:0%
last two times that this has gone
through

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
like that they make a big error and you
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
know are we claiming that back then that
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's what they did um
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
i am sympathetic to to the fact that you
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
know this was done to split
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
the the catholic vote as as i'm catholic
 
00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.190 align:start position:0%
the the catholic vote as as i'm catholic
myself

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
and i would say that people like myself
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
probably would also not have been
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote back in the 60s so um
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that looks like me um so i
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
think you know that it in and now you
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
know you have two districts that have
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
two of the largest population centers in
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
the state you have the city one has
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
manchester city two has nashua
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
so and i think that the demographics of
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
it actually help help both districts i
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
think having um you know diverse
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
populations and both are are is good for
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
is good for it so you know just as if
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that the north
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
country is well represented making sure
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
that we have uh diverse demographics uh
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic demographics in each
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
district is important too so
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
once again that's why i'm supporting
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
this map
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%

you're kind of making my point the two
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
representatives you're kind of making my
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
point for me which is why are we basing
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
a map off of
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
at the time when people of color would
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to vote and women would
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to vote
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
we keep making changes that's still at
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
the at the end of the day you're coming
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
state you're making statements that
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately support my argument which is
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
we are making a least change method
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
we're making least change on a map
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
that was built for nefarious purposes
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
at a time when voters were being
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
actively suppressed based on their
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
gender and the color of their skin
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
when do we hit the reset i keep asking
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
when do we hit the reset button when do
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
we hit it is it in 10 years and and i
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
respect the fact that republicans have
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
drawn the districts it's not a it's not
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
an invalid argument but if anybody's
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
ever followed me knows i don't stand up
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
for my party when it does wrong things
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
in fact i catch a lot of flack for it um
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
because i pointed out i'm uh
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for an example i've
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
advocated for eq for equal marriage for
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
10 years in my party and i get beat up
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
for it at times and i'm going to keep
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
doing it because it's the right thing to
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
do i don't stand up for when people do
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
bad things they did a bad thing in 1880
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
they should have changed it in 2010 they
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
should have changed it the moment
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
we realized hey like we shouldn't draw
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
districts around religious minorities
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
like they should have done it then but
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to do it now so
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
why not

00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
similar communities together you guys
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
call them communities of interest we
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
want similar communities together
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
we want
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
a district that respects
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
political existing political boundaries
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
here's county alliance we want districts
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
that have a low deviation
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
we want districts that make sense
 
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.310 align:start position:0%
we want districts that make sense
so

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
here's what i did
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
i gave you exactly what you asked for
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
i kept every economic community together
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
that wasn't already divided by a county
 
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
that wasn't already divided by a county
line

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
i kept county line i use county lines
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
because that is how the federal
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
government distributes money
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
i don't agree that that's how the
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
federal that's how the
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
government should distribute money but
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
that is how they distribute money so
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
here we have a map
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
that keeps eight out of the ten counties
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
entirely together
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
it keeps every economic community
 
00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.190 align:start position:0%
it keeps every economic community
together

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
it prioritizes
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
the population center of the state which
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
is the i-93 economic quarter if you've
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
ever looked at a population map of new
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire that is the largest
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
population center of the state the
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
second largest by the way is the sea
 
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.430 align:start position:0%
second largest by the way is the sea
coast

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
coast
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
our current map
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
prioritizes the seacoast and then
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
divides the i-93 economic corridor
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
sacrificing the largest population
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
center of the state for the sake of a
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
smaller one
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's time that that ends
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
as representative as the representative
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh smith said um steve smith sorry for
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
using your first name represented but
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's two smiths today
 
00:32:36.159 --> 00:32:38.710 align:start position:0%
it's two smiths today
um

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
it's time that the communities
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
that have similar interests are able to
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
effectively advocate it and it's time
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
for communities that aren't there to be
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
able to have their their word too
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
if you live in the north country
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
you are currently divided
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
that changes now your voice is stronger
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
if you live in the valley
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
your devi uh your voice is now no longer
 
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.830 align:start position:0%
your devi uh your voice is now no longer
diluted

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
diluted
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
by the lakes region
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
this puts the communities together
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
it puts the center of the state's
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
population together it has the lowest
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
population deviation of any map publicly
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
presented that i am aware of if someone
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
has one that gets it lower than four and
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
five please bring it to me i would love
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
to see it
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i did this
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
i did this so that the people who have
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
made the arguments for communities of
 
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.750 align:start position:0%
made the arguments for communities of
interest

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
and political boundaries
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
can explain to me why they oppose this
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
and i knew what they would do
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
i knew what they would do i knew they
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
would oppose it because once again their
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
arguments are bankrupt i knew they would
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
immediately go to competitiveness this
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous term that on last friday i
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
asked people testifying define that
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
define competitive i'm a numbers guy i
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
got started in data i still program
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
computers to this day
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
i work with data i look at numbers
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
no one
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
no one has been able to define it and
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the member from nashua
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
he was asked earlier even he didn't have
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
it in his notes to define it
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
i have said it time and time again
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
i look at outcome
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
i look at outcome
 
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.109 align:start position:0%
i look at outcome
so

00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
i asked last friday the quote fair maps
 
00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.190 align:start position:0%
i asked last friday the quote fair maps
people

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
what do you use as your benchmark for
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
competitive and there wasn't a real
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
straight answer but we did get a data
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
point out of it which was we look at the
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
2020 election
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
so i built this map not based on
 
00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.829 align:start position:0%
so i built this map not based on
politics

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
politics
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
i kept county lines and commun economic
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
communities together
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then i said what is the 2020 outcome
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
because that is what the quote fair maps
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
people said
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
the republican would have won by 300 and
 
00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
some odd votes
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
50.05 percent
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
and yet here we go
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's not competitive 50.05 percent is
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
not competitive
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
with the standard that they set
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
you want to keep counties together
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
current map splits five this one splits
 
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.510 align:start position:0%
current map splits five this one splits
two

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
the map you just proposed splits five
 
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.870 align:start position:0%
the map you just proposed splits five
counties

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
no economic community is split
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's got the lowest deviation i look
 
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.030 align:start position:0%
it's got the lowest deviation i look
forward

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
to your objections to this map other
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
than it's not what we currently have
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
i look forward to it i literally woke up
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
this morning i don't know if i'm looking
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
for today because we'll see what happens
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
in the long run but i am i am excited
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
for the shamelessness
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
of communities of interest in county
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
lines and and competitiveness
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
here's your map the problem is you got
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what you wanted i gave it to you
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to oppose it so
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
madam chairman like i said 8 out of 10
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
counties are kept together every
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
economic community is kept together
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
it recognizes the the shift in
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
population from the current map the
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
current maps design like i said is 300
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be 300 000 off it was passed today
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
this one's off by four and a half people
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
it meets all of the legal and
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements of both the
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
united states constitution and the new
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution and i look
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
forward eagerly look forward to this
 
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.630 align:start position:0%
forward eagerly look forward to this
debate

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry i do have
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
to say my mind has wandered to what my
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
day would look like if you were really
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
really looking forward to it
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
um representative bergeron thank you
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't want to disappoint the
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative from the litchfield in
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
manchester so i would be happy to object
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
to some of the
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh issues he raised with with some
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions and i'll focus on the two
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
areas that he highlighted as being very
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
interested in that is numbers and
 
00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.030 align:start position:0%
interested in that is numbers and
outcome

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
so let me start with numbers
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative barry in
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
arguing against the previous amendment
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
we discussed you indicated that moving
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
one town and 9 000 people
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
was too high based on another
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
alternative you had in your back pocket
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
however this proposal that you put
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
before us would move approximately 460
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
000 people from 73 towns from one
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
district to another
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
representing about a third of the
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
population of new hampshire
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
could you explain how you can condone
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
that kind of population disruption based
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
on your early argument that there should
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
be minimal change in population and
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
townships correct so i'm happy to do
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
that actually because senator barry
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're recognized because i didn't make
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
that argument
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
your side made that argument your side
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
advocated for lease change
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
that was not my argument in fact i just
 
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
spent grandiosing for five minutes about
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
how i think least change is pretty
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
messed up
 
00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
messed up
so

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
i start with a blank slate i don't build
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
districts around politicians i haven't
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
in none of the maps that i have drawn
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
personally have ever built around a
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
politician if you followed me on any
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
times in election law i i have horror
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
incumbency advantage
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
i actually tried to reform the finance
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
laws so that it was reduced
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
you're the side
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
that wants to use least change
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're respectfully representative and
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'll address this to the speaker to the
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
to the chairman
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
i am not the one trying to use a map
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
from 1880 that was designed to suppress
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
catholics as my base map
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
i'm using a map
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
based on county lines
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
and economic communities to make my map
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
i didn't suggest lease change
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
i suggested a map that represents new
 
00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:28.470 align:start position:0%
i suggested a map that represents new
hampshire

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
further question man i'm sure
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
during this committee's consideration of
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
redistricting redistricting proposals
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
for senate districts and executive
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
council districts sponsors or members of
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
this committee uh argued that incumbency
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
was in fact a concern in some of the map
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
drawing that was being done
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh in this proposal
 
00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
uh in this proposal
um

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
and i recognize that you already
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that incumbency wasn't
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily a concern
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
you move representative custer and
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative pappas into the same
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
congressional district could you explain
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
your rationale for doing so
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
um correct so my right representative
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
barry you're recognizing thank you ma'am
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'll try and i'll try to get the
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
recognition first correct as i said i
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
didn't consider incumbents and
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
candidates if you'll notice uh
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative there are in my proposed
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
map members of my own party
 
00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
map members of my own party
running

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
in a district drawn out of this district
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know why because i didn't consider
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
politicians when drawing my map
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
and your reference to the state senate
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
and executive council map representative
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't draw those they are presented
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
to me as effectively binary options
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
i was the primary driver of this map
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i drew it like i wanted it to be and
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
i do not draw districts around
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
incumbents i do not draw districts
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
around politicians if that's a priority
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
of your party
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine it is not mine
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
one final question if i may
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.670 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
chair

00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.630 align:start position:0%
chair
um

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative barry i don't think it's
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily just a concern of my party
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i think you already alluded to this
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
and your most recent response
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
your proposal would move
 
00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.390 align:start position:0%
your proposal would move
um

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
out of congressional district one
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
the candidates tim baxter gail huff
 
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.630 align:start position:0%
the candidates tim baxter gail huff
brown

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
brown
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
mark kilbane
 
00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
mark kilbane
and

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
carolyn levitt from the republican
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
primary in congressional district one
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
into congressional district two
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
thereby probably
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
almost ensuring that candidate matt
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
mowers uh will win that seat
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
was your
 
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.230 align:start position:0%
was your
intent

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
intent
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
to do that to redistrict in such a way
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you would be favoring one
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
congressional candidate over another
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative barry i waited thank you
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
um absolutely not
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
my point of drawing this map was one
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
that would best represent the state of
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
it is not my fault
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
that three
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a candidate i've never
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
heard of and i apologize um but
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
that three of the candidates are in the
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
seacoast it's not my fault it's not my
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
fault that the seacoast is in the other
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
congressional seat
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
they react i didn't factor in any
 
00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:13.030 align:start position:0%
they react i didn't factor in any
any

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
any
candidate

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the notion
 
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
and the notion
that

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
i should have drawn districts around
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
candidates running today
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
for the next 10 years
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
is insane
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
you draw a district that best represents
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
the state i do not draw districts around
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
candidates and politicians i've never
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
done it
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
the caucus will tell you i've never done
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
it i don't do it
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
if your party wants to advocate for that
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to advocate for drawing
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
districts for the next 10 years based
 
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
districts for the next 10 years based
along

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
hypothetical candidates today which by
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
the way there's no federal rule you can
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
run in a seat you don't live in i
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
believe congressman maxine waters does
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
not live in her congressional district
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i believe she's a leader of the
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
democratic party
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
never been a problem
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
i drew this district specifically to
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
give you exactly what you asked for
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's not my fault you don't like what
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
you asked for thank you representative
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
barry um just for clarification for
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
people who don't know representative
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
berry is absolutely correct and sort of
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
goes back to my point about
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
these districts being difficult to deal
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
with on a state you do not
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the federal congressional offices
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
need to reside in the district
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
we currently have a candidate for cd2
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
um who does not reside in cd2
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
it does sort of um raise the issue as to
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
your representation are you doing it for
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
the district or the state representative
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
marjorie smith
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair before i i
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
begin i would like to register my
 
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
begin i would like to register my
distress

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
at words like bankrupt and insane
 
00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.589 align:start position:0%
at words like bankrupt and insane
when

00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
we are a deliberative body we where we
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
are expected in a in a civil way
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
to exchange deeply held views but i
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
personally believe we can do that
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
without using
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
terms that
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
are clearly meant to be offensive
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
i would like however if i could
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you for your
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
comment i i
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
would hope that no one is ascribing
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
personal motive to any member of this
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee i would like to thank all of
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee because i
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
have not taken that i will tell you as
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
an as a former attorney i have just
 
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.470 align:start position:0%
an as a former attorney i have just
retired

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
retired
 
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
retired
um

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
bankrupt has a meaning and it is quite
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
useful in a descriptive term and um i'm
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the representative is
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
sorry that you might have taken offense
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
from the term but as a chair i did not
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
so i would have ruled it out of order if
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
i did so thank you very much for
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
bringing that to our attention you can
 
00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:04.950 align:start position:0%
bringing that to our attention you can
continue

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i notice you didn't mention
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
insane i couldn't remember the other
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
word and frankly that's directed at me
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
so often during the course of a day i
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't take anything from that
 
00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:16.550 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't take anything from that
um

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i wonder if um
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
the member could help me understand the
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
community of interest between for
 
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.069 align:start position:0%
community of interest between for
example

00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
so yes i'm i'm i describe that in my and
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
first of all representative i would i i
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
do have genuine respect for you we sat
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
together at the hillsborough county um
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
hearing session and i generally enjoyed
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
that time together that was not meant to
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
offend you and if it did i am sorry i do
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
mean what i said but i did not mean it
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
in a defensive way um to answer your
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
question about what do these two groups
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
have together
 
00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.190 align:start position:0%
have together
currently

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
they are smaller than the main economic
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
and population center of the state
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they have in common they're
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
not the i-93 economic quarter which is
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
actually over half of the state but you
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
can't get more than half of the state
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
into one district so that's what they
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
have in common
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
i hear this and i alluded to this at the
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
beginning which is you know everybody
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
wants to think east west but nobody
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
thinks north south
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
and currently if you start in salem and
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
you drive to pittsburgh new hampshire
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
you come in and out of the district five
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
times and i would also
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
proposition you this what does salem
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
have in common with pittsburgh new
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire what does portsmouth how is
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
portsmouth the same as manchester i live
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
on the south side of manchester it's a
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
working class community portsmouth is an
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
upper class affluent community we're not
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
the same we're in the same district
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is about putting districts together
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
that best prioritize the whole state and
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
in this map that i've proposed
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
the two districts you say you mentioned
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
you mentioned hampton and westmoreland i
 
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
you mentioned hampton and westmoreland i
believe

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
will have a better chance of influencing
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
their congressmen instead of just being
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
drowned out by
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
nashua or the i-93 corridor or whoever
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
whatever is
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
whatever is i understand nash was in
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
by what i meant is a larger economic a
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
larger community they have the
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity as an economic community to
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
be on a more equal playing field
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's done like this
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i put the largest economic
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
community together so that their
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
interests are focused on and that the
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
other smaller economic communities like
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith smith the other
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative smith can have a voice
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
like the north country can stop being
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
divided and have a larger voice and an
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the outcome and their
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
congressmen that's why it's done like
 
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.309 align:start position:0%
congressmen that's why it's done like
that

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just like to point out
 
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just like to point out
and

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative specia right after i'm
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
finished um
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
i sort of look at this map and even
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
though we're talking about new hampshire
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting i think of the license
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
plate of maine which says vacation land
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
um because the north country the
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
seacoast and the west part of the state
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
are certainly uh vacation destinations
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
um for people coming in from out of
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
state um representative espisia
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
well i mean
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
i think nashville is a great vacation
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
place and we'll take it from name there
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
you go but um i have just a question for
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative very i know you talked
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
about splitting the catholic vote
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
earlier so why is you know national
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
manchester why are we still splitting
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
them up and
 
00:47:19.599 --> 00:47:20.470 align:start position:0%
them up and
um

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
and yeah i just you know why are you
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
continuing this pattern yep um i'm sorry
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
i wait for my follow-up i'll wait for my
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
recognition i'm sorry thank you the last
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
time i let you go right yes you're
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
recognized representative thank you so
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great point and i i figured
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
it would be raised um the difference is
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not designing a map
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
i went to catholic school i'm not
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
catholic myself
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
but i went to catholic school i wouldn't
 
00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:46.150 align:start position:0%
but i went to catholic school i wouldn't
design

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
a map that would try to disenfranchise
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
what was basically every friend i had in
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
high school
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
so that's the difference it's not
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
designed to do that the stated interest
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
of this map is the i-93 economic
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
corridor that's the state interest
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
stated in interest in 1880 was making
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
sure the catholics couldn't swing an
 
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.069 align:start position:0%
sure the catholics couldn't swing an
election

00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i by the way i also don't know where
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
the major catholic populations are
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
anymore they probably are manchester
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
nashua they probably are but my
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is i think actually the
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
plurality of the state is now catholic
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
um it may be a majority so if it is i'm
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
sorry but if it's probably a plurality
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
at this point so drawing a map that
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
would disenfranchise the catholic vote i
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
think at this point would be impossible
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't the intention in drawing
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
it and that's the difference in tensions
 
00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
it and that's the difference in tensions
matter

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
i've seen no more red lights or hands
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:41.190 align:start position:0%
representative lane
um

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand the continual
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
reference to the 1880 map
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
because the map has changed over 140
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
years the map that we are redoing is the
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
2012 map
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
not the 1880 map so
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
i don't understand all these references
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the 1880 map and the 300 000 people
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
and whatever
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we're focused on today is the 2012
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
map and the maps that have come before
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
us over the past eight months
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
so it's just a comment because it it
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
that doesn't re that doesn't convince me
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
of anything i don't know how convincing
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
that point is what's convincing are the
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
other points that you have made
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
but i also
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
i do think there's something to be said
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
for such radical change
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
for people
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
particularly in my district but also i
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
don't comment this as representing the
 
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.910 align:start position:0%
don't comment this as representing the
people

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
of merrimack
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
of my district merrimack 12 which was
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
ward 2 of concord i come at this looking
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
at it is this the best for the entire
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
state so i reference back to your
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
comment about you look at this as how to
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
help the people of manchester i look at
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
i look at this as what's best for the
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
people of our state is it better to
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
totally redo and move over i can't
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
remember the exact number of them
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
or is it better to move one town and i
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
still come down on the side of moving
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
one town
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
because when we heard comments
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh and the ten counties that we went to
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
nobody said
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
please redo the whole thing we want you
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
to start from zero you know we never
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
heard that comment
 
00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:34.470 align:start position:0%
heard that comment
um

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that's really the only real comments
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lane
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
representative steve smith
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um to answer the
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
question why we keep talking about the
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
1880 maps because i think it was at our
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
very last meeting that we were presented
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the 1880 maps and subsequent maps
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
in the middle to build a case
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we have always had a policy i don't
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
know who we are but
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
the people doing redistricting over 100
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
years started with that and based it on
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
that and we're talking about it because
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to indict that argument
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
that was made before this committee that
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
that is the proper course forward we we
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
disagree with that
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that's why we're responding to
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
the 1880 map
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that's before us
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
well it didn't solve my problem of cd2
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
being you know a horrific mess
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
and hard to campaign
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
you solve the other problem though with
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
i will have new hampshire will have one
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative who will care deeply
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
about i-93 who will probably have a
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
tattoo somewhere that says i-93 because
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to live and
 
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.109 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to live and
breathe

00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
breathe
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
and what i get out of it
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
is a representative that never has to
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
think about 93. so at least thank you
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
for solving one of my problems and it's
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
a big one
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
further questions representative lynn
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
i just want to make a comment um i
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
as representative barry pointed out
 
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.030 align:start position:0%
as representative barry pointed out
earlier

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
a great deal of the focus prior to today
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
from our friends on the other side of
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
the aisle was the lack of competitive
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of prior proposals
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
representative barry has made it seem
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
what seems to me to be a pretty
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
compelling argument about the
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of these of
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
of the proposal he's presented now and
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
interestingly i haven't heard any
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
anything from our friends on the other
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle to contradict that in
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
any way to say that oh no he's wrong the
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
competitiveness is something different
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
than what he proposed so i leave the
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
question if uh if competitiveness is
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
important to you and it seems to me you
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
should vote for representative barry's
 
00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:42.710 align:start position:0%
should vote for representative barry's
proposal

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%

comments

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
the trouble with having only two
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
districts is that if you have one that
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
is coherent and focused that means the
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
other district is everybody else there's
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
no other way around it you can either
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
have two
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
scattered districts
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
or you can make a one coherent district
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
a principal
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
and then the other district has to be
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
everything else in the state
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that's just a matter of of the
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
numbers and the way we're split you can
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
make your split any way you like
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
but you can't have two coherent
 
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
but you can't have two coherent
districts

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
when the state itself is not coherent
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative espicia
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
so in terms of competitiveness i mean
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
we've made cd2 even more even less
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
competitive we've made it significantly
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
less competitive so i don't you know i i
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
mean yes
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
great we've made cd1 very competitive a
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
cd we've basically thrown away cd2 and
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
said you know what cd2 you're basically
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
gonna win um with this kind of map
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and you know i i love sports i'm a
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
big sports guy and i will also say
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
though like the map that was presented
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
that with uh my colleague from nashville
 
00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:05.190 align:start position:0%
that with uh my colleague from nashville
presented

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:05.910 align:start position:0%
presented
it

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
it keeps our districts competitive and i
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
will also just add that you know i just
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
i saw the boston celtics game and they
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
were what an eight seed and they beat
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
the number one seed had the the brooklyn
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
nets who were supposedly the gonna be
 
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
the winners of of of the nba
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
championship this year so you know just
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
because you know you you have this
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
competitive edge doesn't mean it's it's
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
a forego you should just give it up
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment i'll just
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
point out that um during the course of
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
our review of material as i recall we
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the current cd2 that had
 
00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:43.190 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the current cd2 that had
a

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:43.910 align:start position:0%
a
uh

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
competitiveness swing to one side of
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
over i think nine percent
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
um and it was identified as a liens
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
to one side i don't know any political
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
measure that finds nine percent a mere
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
leaning so
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
i agree that cd2 unfortunately
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
um has as representative smith steve
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
smith might say has had one problem
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
taken care of representative barry and
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
then representative yes um happy to
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
address that for you representative i'm
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
from nashua excuse me
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm not gonna live that down
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
am i no i didn't think so
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
how many times has the current cd2
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
changed hands in the last under the
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
current map
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
the answer is zero
 
00:55:33.839 --> 00:55:34.710 align:start position:0%
the answer is zero
none

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's not competitive now
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
what it appears and
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna address this to the chair
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
because i don't wanna single out
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
remember what it appears madam chairman
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
my friends on the other side's
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
definition of competitive is this is
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
a system where they win every time both
 
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.549 align:start position:0%
a system where they win every time both
districts

00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's effectively what it is that
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's the argument that they're making
 
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.150 align:start position:0%
that's the argument that they're making
um

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
and it's a fair argument you know that
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
they've had success at the top of the
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
federal ballot over the last not just 10
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
years but 20 years it's it's it's just
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
once again it's just math right just
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
numbers results i'm a results guy
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
but this is what i look
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
at over the last 10 years roughly
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
46 to 47 let's just help my argument say
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
47 of the state has voted reliably for a
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
republican candidate on a federal level
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
and we have zero representation we have
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
no shot
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have no shot we make arguments about
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
oh if you make cd2 on competitive
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
republicans you're gonna stop voting
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's meant to you know scare us to not
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
support it's not it's already not
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
competitive it's already there
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
you know it's there i mean i know you
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
won't say i'm sure i know they won't say
 
00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
won't say i'm sure i know they won't say
it

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
but they know it um
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is not a map that locks in a
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
republican victory it doesn't it does i
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
just told you 50.05
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
is not a lock
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
what it does is it gives republicans a
 
00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:00.150 align:start position:0%
what it does is it gives republicans a
chance

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
chance
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
and if we're talking about outcome and i
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the last 20 years but i
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
like to talk about the last 10 because
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's the current map
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's fair that the other side would have
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
a reliably
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
a reliable district the voters have said
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they want
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
but to ignore the 47 percent of the
 
00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:18.390 align:start position:0%
but to ignore the 47 percent of the
state

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
that wants something else and to say no
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
you can never have anything
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
under some subjective term of
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
competitiveness it's
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's ludicrous it's ludicrous this
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
is not a map that locks a republican in
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
you can't draw one by the way the most
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
extreme example i was able to make
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
had a republican winning with 53 percent
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the vote the most extreme example you
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
can't make it the population of the
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
state does not allow for it
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
this is a district
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
that a republican can win not a
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
republican will win
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
and to your point representative
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes the eighth seed will knock out
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
the one seed
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
and if that means a republican happens
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
to win in cd2 with a disadvantage
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
god bless him and that's the will of the
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
voters but it's time that
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
one party have a chance we have a chance
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
not a lock
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
we rejected a lock
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
the governor rejected a lock he said
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
don't do it he rejected a lock
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
this is not a lock this is a chance and
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's a difference representative
 
00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:24.390 align:start position:0%
there's a difference representative
talersky

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
talersky
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
i thank the committee for giving me the
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
chance to participate in the discussion
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh we we thank you for being willing to
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
come back
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's always i think a good sign thank
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
you um i just wanted to comment quickly
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing from the representative
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
about how
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
the map
 
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.870 align:start position:0%
the map
includes

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.549 align:start position:0%
includes
the

00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
cd1 with the the economic um
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
community there around 93 um and then it
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
was referred to cd2 being everything
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
else or a vacation land and um i guess
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
also coming from nashua
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
i have a little bit of problem with that
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
description um with nashua being an
 
00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:09.670 align:start position:0%
description um with nashua being an
economic

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
economic
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
engine for this state also and the fact
 
00:59:12.079 --> 00:59:13.109 align:start position:0%
engine for this state also and the fact
that

00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
although i love her she is not vacation
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
land so
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't actually believe that um either
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
of those those comments actually do
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
apply to the map but um i think that the
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
state might be better served
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
with understanding uh
 
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.190 align:start position:0%
with understanding uh
two

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
districts that can represent the diverse
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
communities from the north country all
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
the way down to the diverse uh
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
economic drivers uh in the south but
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps having them be a bit more
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
balanced um
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to share that thank you
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think this discussion highlights what
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
the committee heard in hearings that
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of the districting the
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
population of the state makes it
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to do
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
um as
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
some of you were with our hearings in
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
the north country where we heard about
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
how they wanted more representation but
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
the population is what it is so we have
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
to work with the numbers that's where
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
they are presented representative barry
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
so uh to address this because
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative representatives media as
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
well um into this it's a kind of the
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
question to answer grounds why is it
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
nashua in this down there with it um and
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
the answer is it's population deviation
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
um when i released my letter to the
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
chair which i do hope you read if you
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
don't i'm happy to provide you with a
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
copy i listed three tiers of criteria
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
the first one is deviation population
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
deviation and i just could not find a
 
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
deviation and i just could not find a
way

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
and if if you find a way please bring it
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
forward to me but i could not find a way
 
01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:35.990 align:start position:0%
forward to me but i could not find a way
to

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
keep it keep nashua into
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
the i-93 corridor district without just
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
imploding the district
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's once again it's a
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
factor of
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
of where people live in the
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
concentration in which they live um but
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
i did to to reduce it i did make an
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
attempt to do it i actually i did make a
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
good faith effort i just was not able to
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:00.390 align:start position:0%
representative lane
um

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
i i would like to point out
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
when we talk about competitiveness
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
between the two districts that a lot of
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
it has to do with candidates and not
 
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.390 align:start position:0%
it has to do with candidates and not
necessarily

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
the party from which that candidate is
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
from and i think a good example of that
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
is the governor
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
he won both cd1 and cd2
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
i think our current congress people
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
are strong candidates and that is why
 
01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:35.109 align:start position:0%
are strong candidates and that is why
the

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
the majority party is not successful in
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
those districts
 
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.470 align:start position:0%
those districts
so

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
i would offer that they are still
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
competitive districts but perhaps
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
we have stronger candidates for those
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
two races and you have stronger
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
candidates for other races rather than
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments we are
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
discussing amendment 2022
 
01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
discussing amendment 2022
1708

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
1708
 
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.349 align:start position:0%
1708
h

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
h
 
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
anything further from committee members
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure representative bergeron just
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
the question of the sponsor of the
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
amendment representative barry you
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
indicated that you had three criteria in
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
drafting this uh he's mentioned the
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
first one was deviation could you tell
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
us what the other two criteria were uh
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
yes so i had uh to answer i'm sorry
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i i keep stepping over
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
here no i apologize uh go ahead
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative barry um i have three
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
tiers of criteria i had more than three
 
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.990 align:start position:0%
tiers of criteria i had more than three
criteria

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
so the tier one criteria was actually
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
two criteria which was an extremely low
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
population deviation and do not split
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
any cities or towns um obviously those
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
were accomplished
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
so the the tier two criteria
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
was keeping county lines together as
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
much as possible
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
as well as recognizing
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
economic communities
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i stated in the letter once again
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to provide it to you that
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
generally speaking trying to balance
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
those two together i didn't divide an
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
economic community that wasn't already
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
divided by a county line
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
and a really easy example of that is
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
belknap county and carroll county the
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
count the towns of tuftonboro wolfeboro
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
and moultonborough are all lake towns on
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee but they're divided
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
by the carroll county line i didn't draw
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
the carroll county line
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
that was drawn i think in the 1700s
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that was my tier 2 criteria my tier
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
three criteria was competitiveness
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
because that was something that i heard
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
from uh in the governor's veto message
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
or he hasn't vetoed it yet but in the
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
governor's message to us was he didn't
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
believe it was competitive so i wanted
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
to address that um and that and that's
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
why i released that's why on friday i
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
asked the fair maps people
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
what the definition of competitive was i
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
asked the league of women voters what
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
the definition of competitive was the
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
only thing i got out of them was we used
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
2020 so i used 2020 and i released the
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
data along those lines one further
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
question representative bergeron i thank
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
you representative barry for that
 
01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.670 align:start position:0%
you representative barry for that
clarification

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
then i guess my last question is what is
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
your definition of competitiveness
 
01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:13.670 align:start position:0%
so representative barry
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.910 align:start position:0%
so representative barry
[Music]

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.829 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
my definition of competitive is a result
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
that would actively reflect the nature
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the state and as i said earlier the
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
other party has had great success
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
federally for the last 10 to 15 years
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
this does not produce a map that would
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
produce a 50 50 parity this is a map
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
that republicans would have lost in
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
2018. if you take this map back it
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually reflects the balance the the
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
balance of the state which is
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
this map would have produced roughly 60
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
40 outcomes which is the actual
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
electoral balance of the state federally
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
right now statewide state on a state
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
level my party does very well and
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
federally your party does really well
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
um but neither of us have
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know neither of us should be
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
entirely immune um
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know to the point about
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's first election in 2016
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
i believe he won by 1200 votes
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and as his incumbency advantage as he's
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
been in office
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
his incumbency advantage has grown in
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
his service to the people
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
he's been rewarded with that and it's
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
hard to get a foothold when you can't
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
get in the first time so
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
and grow that incumbency advantage so
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
um that that is that is my definition of
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
competitive this is a district that if
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
you take it over the last 10 years would
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
actually represent the state 60 40. um
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
and your party i'm sorry i'm chairman
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
the party of the other side would have a
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
seat where they would more than likely
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
win not a guaranteed win but more than
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
likely win because that's what's been
 
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.230 align:start position:0%
likely win because that's what's been
happening

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.349 align:start position:0%
happening
um

01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that's my definition of competitive
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
and i'll even throw this out there
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's my definition of fair
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron i'm sorry madam
 
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron i'm sorry madam
chair

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
every time there's an answer to one
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
question another one pops in my head
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
um representative barry you're talking
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
about 60 40 splits approximately 40
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
percent of the state is registered as
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated or an undeclared voter
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh with the other 60 percent being
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
almost equally divided between
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats
 
01:06:15.119 --> 01:06:15.990 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats
so

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
again uh you you use the phrase
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
reflecting the nature of of the state to
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
define competitive competitiveness could
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
i have something a little more concrete
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
and less abstract and
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
as to what maybe statistically since
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
you're a numbers guy uh you would define
 
01:06:32.319 --> 01:06:34.549 align:start position:0%
you're a numbers guy uh you would define
competitiveness

01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
competitiveness
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to representative barry
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm i i am happy to define
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
competitiveness i just did i told you
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's based on outcome um to your point
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
about uh party registration
 
01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:46.630 align:start position:0%
about uh party registration
um

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to get a little in the
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
weeds here um my college degree is in a
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
is in a statistical analysis of american
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
political behavior
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
i'm really good at numbers
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
the majority overwhelming majority of
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
independent or unaffiliated voters
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
because i know the representative knows
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have independent voters we have
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated voters
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
are actually not
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated or independent the
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of them um
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
and in fact there is a direct
 
01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.309 align:start position:0%
and in fact there is a direct
correlation

01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
between how often somebody votes and how
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
politically informed they are and how
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
partisan they are and while they may not
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
choose to ascribe to a formal political
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
party label um i can tell you that the
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
staunchest conservatives that i know are
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
not registered republican because they
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
think the republican party is not
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
conservative enough but when they go in
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
that voting booth they ain't splitting
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
their ticket
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
the reality is is that
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of these
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated independent voters while
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
they may not ever admit it publicly when
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
they get into the booth they do pull one
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
side or the other there are people that
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
do split their ballots and if anybody
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
who has ever been to a recount in the
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
state knows
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
split ticket voting accounts for maybe
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
10 of the state of the of the ballots
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
maybe 10
 
01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:07.990 align:start position:0%
maybe 10
um

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
2020 might be the
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
might be the uh
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
exception that makes the rule in that
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
case um but split ticket voting in 18
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
and in the years before
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
was not rare but not common
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
so this statistic about you know a
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
plurality of the state is unaffiliated
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
and they're not they're all independent
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
voters they're not independent voters
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
you look at a poll they're actually
 
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.789 align:start position:0%
you look at a poll they're actually
separated

01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
separated
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
independent voters are different from
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
swing voters they're different from
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated voters
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
if you're referring to swing voters that
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't know about the new hampshire
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
electorate specifically going back once
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
again to my degree
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
the swing voters are they change every
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
year based on the changing demographics
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
of a party and the and what the party is
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
presenting but they generally represent
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
anywhere from five to fifteen percent of
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
the electorate
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
um it's a follow-up actually
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
question to representative berry
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
saying that competitive reflects the
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
nature of the state
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
would you say that you used that
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
standard when you approved the other
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
maps that have been before this
 
01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
maps that have been before this
committee

01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative barry so um as i said
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
earlier um i didn't draw
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
those maps
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
i drew this map this is my map that i
 
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:32.870 align:start position:0%
i drew this map this is my map that i
drew

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
drew
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
so while there were things in the other
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
maps that i did not like
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
once again when we get there it's
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
effectively a binary choice yes or no
 
01:09:40.239 --> 01:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
effectively a binary choice yes or no
um

01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to talk about this map
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
this is the map that i drew no other
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
hand went into this map this is my map
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
um so it's a fair point to raise and i'm
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
not trying to dodge the question but to
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
my point my point is i didn't draw those
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's a binary choice i have to weigh
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
everything with this i was able to
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative lane
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
you voted for them yes that's also i
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
voted for them so obviously i might my
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
vote fee speaks for itself
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
and we all have lots of those
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i am going to ask
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%

madam chair

calendar for next week
 
01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:42.630 align:start position:0%
calendar for next week
um

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.229 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:44.239 --> 01:13:45.669 align:start position:0%
and
then

01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
tell me what happens after that does it
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
then go to a committee of conference or
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
does this bill then go back to the
 
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.110 align:start position:0%
does this bill then go back to the
senate

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
and how do we
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
how do we process that given the fact
 
01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:02.550 align:start position:0%
how do we process that given the fact
that

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is a regular bill and would have to
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
be signed by the governor and the
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
governor has already indicated that he
 
01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.790 align:start position:0%
governor has already indicated that he
um

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
did not think this got us to where we
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to be so does it go back to the
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
senate or does it go to a committee of
 
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.390 align:start position:0%
senate or does it go to a committee of
conference

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
where do we go from here representative
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
smith i know that you know the process
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
for this bill at this point you
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
certainly have many years of service in
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
this and i found representative berry's
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
arguments this morning quite compelling
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
so what the future course of this bill
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
as to outcome is i would never speculate
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
as to a bill coming out of a committee
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
in this house whether it's a house bill
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
or a senate bill as to what its ultimate
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
outcome is but it will follow the usual
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
course of bills as you know and it will
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
go to the house floor for
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
a vote and given that it is a senate
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill i believe it needs to get out of
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
the house by a date that has been
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
established by our body the house i mean
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
it will be sent to the senate for their
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
consideration and we will await
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh the decision of the senate as to what
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
they will do because we have certainly
 
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
amended sb 200 which they sent over to
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
us for some districts in april
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
so we will see how the process unfolds
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
as we will see with all the other senate
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
bills we will be considering on the
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
floor next week over two days
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
of session
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
anything further for the committee
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%

01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%

01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%

uh for just ask christina to email it to
